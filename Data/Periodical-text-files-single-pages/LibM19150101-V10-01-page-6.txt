Isa. 31:1. " For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way. . . . So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us." Ezra 8: 22, 23. "Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."Š Jesus. " If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."Š Jesus.
