"P"  Ł it, — v Ł"Łv-  ,''Pv—.v WE have had so many requests to republish the article and illustra-tion entitled " The Love of Power and the Power of Love," which appeared in our December, 1902, issue, in one of the weekly SENTINELS, that we have concluded to do so. This article clearly contrasts the two great religious systems,ŠChristianity and the Papacy. A copy should be placed in the hands of all clergymen, church members, public men, and men of influence in every community. Thousands of copies ought to be distributed in every State in the Union. Prices,for this number will be as follows: 5 copies - - 7 cents 5o copies - - 70 cents to copies - - 14 cents 100 copies - - - $1.25 25 copies - - 35 cents 1000 copies - - $12.00 Let every ffiend of THE SENTINEL have a hand in this good work. Order all you can use yourself, and tell your friends about this number; many of them will doubtless want to order a quantity to come with yours, or to come separately. Orders ought to reach us by March 8, 1903. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING COMPANY, 11 WEST 20th STREET, NEW YORK CITY. Ł^., Ł . V . ,tk,  *--5k-SCVMWriatc***** ŁF f Ł," Ł k V. > Ł  Ł Ł Ł Ł F Ł F : r.
