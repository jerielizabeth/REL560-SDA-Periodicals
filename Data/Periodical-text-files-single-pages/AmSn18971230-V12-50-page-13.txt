AMERICAN SENTINEL. 797 "What is the differencelbetween a lion and a bear?" "One thing is, a lion holds his head up, and looks bold; but a bear holds his head down, and looks sneaky and savage." "That will do. Now, can either a lion, or a bear, be a Christian?" "No, sir. No more'n the pig could." "If the nation represented by the lion, or the bear, had declared by law or decree, that it was a Christian nation, would it have made itself a Christian nation?" "No, sir; it would have told a lie." "Now can you think of another nation that is repre-sented in the Bible by a beast?" "Yes, sir. The two-horned beast is like the United States." "Well, here is a picture of a two-horned beast. How do you like his looks?" "He looks cross." "He looks some like a tiger." "He has got a mane like a lion." "He's got two little horns; I shouldn't think hecould hook very well with them." "Can such a beast be a Christian?" "No, sir!" "Can the people who make up this nation, and are as bad tempered as such a beast, be a Christian nation?" "No, sir; but there are some good Christians among them." "Yes; but they belong to the kingdom of heaven. There are, also, a good many others not claiming to be Christians, who are excellent people, and who would like to better the management of the government, but can-not. God represents the nation by the spirit that actu-ally rules it. Now, if I should write on a slip of paper, as I did for the pig, This is a Christian,' would that make him a Christian any more than it did the pig?" "No, sir." "Well, on the 29th of February, 1892, the Supreme Court of the United States declared this to be 'a Chris-tian nation.' Did that decision make it a Christian nation?" "No, sir. It was like the two-horned beast just the same as before." "True. In the Bible God does not change the symbol or beast representing this nation to the end of time; only he is once or twice called the 'false prophet,' because he said he was a Christian when he wasn't one at all." A. SMITH. - 10- ≈Å -4 4 MRS. V. F. Cox, in the December issue of The Defender, makes the truthful observation that the training of chil-dren to proper Sabbath observance cannot be accom-plished "by the methods employed by the stern old man who tied his boy to the bedpost on the Sabbath so he shouldn't play marbles, and made him learn the hymn, Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love.'
