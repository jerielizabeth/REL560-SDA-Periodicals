Urn  PROTESTING AGAINST APOSTASY A sixty-four page quarterly magazine condemning ecclesiastical error, advocating primitive Christianity, protesting against apostasy, defining clearly the principles of Protestantism contrasted with those of Ca-tholicism, interpreting the prophetic utter-ances of the Bible thought to apply to the Papacy, and citing their fulfilment in the events of history. It is a magazine that deals with principles alone. It does not condemn individual members of any communion. Send for sample copy. Subscription price, 25 cents a year.

The Most Practical of All HEALTH MAGAZINES LIFE AND HEALTH is a magazine published with the special view of meeting the needs of the individual, teaching how to pre-serve the health by prescribing simple, com-mon-sense regulations that aid nature in M resisting disease, and suggesting home treat- M ments for many of the common diseases. It is the kind of health journal the people like. It is not the organ of some pet theory of some individual or institution, but a rational, corn-mon-sense digest of competent authority, full of plain teaching on the science of healthful living that can be applied in the home.
