These posters are signed by officers of the road, the first name being that of the central passenger agent, who, no doubt, arranges the excursions for the money that is in them. bath-breaking in plowing a field on Sunday. He appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, and the sentence was affirmed. The case was then taken up by the Adventists and the National Secu-lar Association, and appealed to the Federal Court, and argued on the ground that the conviction was contrary to the Bill of Rights of the State of Ten-nessee and the Constitution of the United States. The decision does not so much traverse the subject of the constitutionality of the law against Sabbath breaking, but it says it is not the province of the Federal Court to review the case of a conviction under process of the State law. The decision may be right, but the law which does not allow a man who rests on Saturday Łto work Sunday in such a way as not to interfere with the rest of others is bad law, and bad morals, and bad religion." This is in marked contrast with the comments made by some of the religious press, and does credit to the Independent. Our contemporary errs however in saying that the National Secular Associ-ation has anything to do with the case, it should have said the National Religious Liberty Associa-tion. side, as in England where probably very few per-sons are aware that the Lord's-Day Observance Act of Charles II. is still in force. But it is, and a Hair-dressers' Association tried to take advanage of it at Oldham the other day. It appears that a barber in that town refused either to join the union or close his shop on Sunday morning, and it occurred to some of the union officials that the old statute might be used to bring him to terms. A warrant was procured against him, and he was arrested; but the magistrates saw through the trick and dismissed the case on the ground that the prosecution was malicious and prompted by a de-sire to help the Association, rather than by any anxiety about the proper observance of the Sab-bath. Whether they would refuse to enforce the law in a case where the motive was less suspicious they did not say, but it appears that some barbers were fined at Derby not long ago for shaving on *Sunday. Probably the Derby judiciary do not con-sider shaving to be a work of necessity. It very clearly is not to a good many." " To such an extent has Sabbath desecration been carried in our sister city of Dayton, that the best citizens there have recently organized a Law and Order society. Of their three hundred and sixty-two saloons, three hundred and forty were open either by front door or back, on the Sabbath. Of three hundred groceries, one hundred and fifty did business on that day. Of eighty seven meat mar-kets, eighty supplied customers. All of the drug stores were open, and fourteen out of the nineteeen photograph galleries. Eleven thousand " Sunday newspapers were sold or distributed in the city." Thus from every quarter comes the news of in-creasing agitation of the Sunday question in all its phase's, of growing disregard of the day on the part of some, and of louder and more persistent de-mands for Sunday laws and their enforcement on the part of others. THE Junior Order of United American Mechan-ics of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, passed at a late meeting the following resolutions: "Whereas it has been customary for foreign societies to hold public parades, celebrating foreign events, upon the Sabbath, commonly called Sun-day, thereby desecrating the American Sabbath and casting reflections upon our free institutions, founded upon principles advocated by our fore-fathers and upheld by us, one of which is to keep the Sabbath holy, and to remain a day of rest; Therefore be it Resolved, That this Council condemns all such parades and demonstrations as being un-American and dangerous, both to the sanctity of the Sabbath and to the spirit of our free institutions, and that these resolutions be brought before the Advisory Council of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics for action by the representatives of that body, and that we hereby commend the Mayor of our city for refusing to address such bodies on that day." It worthy of notice that these resolutions do not openly ask the suppression of the Sunday pa-rades of foreign societies by law, but the suppo-sition is that such action would meet the appro-bation of this order. The phraseology employed bears unmistakable evidence to the parentage of the resolution, and shows how generally the " National Reform " spirit is permeating all classes and finding expression through organizations which are not professedly religious in their pur-poses. ACCORDING to the Boston Herald, of the 5th inst., a committee representing the several Young People's Christian Endeavor societies in Lynn has decided to adopt decisive measures regarding the enforcement of law on Sundays. The action, the Herald says, will be independent of the police authorities. The committee, so it is reported, proposes to secure warrants for two or three storekeepers who open their places on Sunday, and make test cases of them. Members of the committee refuse to state what plan of action lias been determined upon. The city government was petitioned by the soci-eties to take action in the premises, but refused. The condition of affairs in Lynn on Sundays, its citizens claim, is no worse than in other cities in Massachusetts. THE Christian at Work, of August 6, has the following: " Some little time ago we directed attention to some obsolete laws which were on the statute books of this State until the adoption of the present Codes swept them away. One of these laws al-lowed any householder to stretch a chain across a highway in front of his house, and stop all Sunday traffic, though the parson's horse and the doctor's ,one-horse shay must be allowed to pass. And nat-urally the same features are met with on the other    4-.         THE Protestants and Roman Catholics of a fash-ionable suburb of Montreal are at loggerheads re-garding the proper observance of Sunday. Accord-ing to their custom from time immemorial and in consonance with the teaching of their religious advisers Roman Catholics do not think it improper to indulge in dancing, ball playing, or other simi-lar amusements in the afternoon of Sunday, But their Protestant neighbors, in this case, have deter-mined that they will not tolerate any sacrilegious frivolity of this kind. The expression of religious fervor on the part of the Protestants became so intense that the presence of the Mayor was necessary to prevent a social riot. These Protestants forget that Sunday is a Roman Catholic institution and as they established it there can be no higher authority than they as to what shall constitute its proper religious observ-ance. THE New York Independent, of August 6, thus states the facts in the King case and com-ments upon the decision and the law :Š " A case of which we have more than once spoken was decided last week by the United States District Court at Memphis, Tennessee. A Seventh-day Adventist, R. M. King, was convicted of Sab-                                        SACRED CHRONOLOGY. BY SYLVZSTER BLISS. THIS work treats of the Elements of Chronol-ogy, the different systems, and the various eras, and gives the chronology of the principal events recorded in sacred history from the creation till the death of St. John. It also2 contains a vindica-tion of the numbers of the Hebrew Scriptures. As an aid to investigation it is invaluable. The book has been thoroughly revised, and an entire chapter added, on the PEOPLING OF THE EARTH. This chapter is an exposition of the tenth chapter of Genesis, and gives an outline of the beginning of history and THE ORIGIN OF NATIONS. New and valuable notes have been added to the original text of the book, making it the most val-uable work on the subject of sacred chronology extant. No student of history can well do with-out it. It contains a vast amount of information in small space, and so far from being dry it is as interesting as a story, which it really is. 300 pages, cloth binding, with side stamp, $ 1.00.
