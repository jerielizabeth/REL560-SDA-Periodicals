PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, APRIL 23, 1903 NO. 17 It requires but a slight knowledge-of history to know that the act of 1794 was passed in deference to the religious convictions of a majority of the people of this Common-wealth at that time. Not only the religious convictions, but the customs and habits based upon those convictions, were the moving cause for the enactment of the Sunday law. Essentially, therefore, the statute was a recognition  of the religious tenets of one part of the community as a reason for placing an interdict upon the occupations  and habits of another part of the community. It is true the act is prohibitive merely. It does not oblige the minority to adopt the religious customs and beliefs of the majority, but it does prohibit the minority from performing acts otherwise innosious, and often salutary and beneficial, out of defer-ence to the religious sensibilities of the majority. If this can be doneŠif the minority can be prohibited from doing something in itself lawful as a deference to the religious views of othersŠit is but a single step, and a very short one, to the position that they may be commanded to do something for the same reason. . . . IF A PROHI-BITION MAY BE ENACTED UPON SUCH GROUNDS, A COMMAND MAY BE ENACTED ALSO, AND IF A COMMAND, THEN A STATUTE REQUIRING RE-LIGIOUS CONFORMITY. ŠFrom argument of Ex-Judge James G. Gordon at Pluladelohra on March 23. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 11 West 20th St., New York City OAKLAND.
