LIBERTY 39 tablished its habits and customs, " it creates the philosophy and religion to justify its acts." Of course this can mean nothing other than that religion is a product of evolution. The president of a well-known Western university recently declared that in all the fearless institu-tions of learning in this country, " it is taught that there is no sense in which God is more in heaven than he is on earth." This is the evolutionary mode of saying that God is not a distinct being, not a personality ; he is simply the soul or self of the universe, including man. That is, the god of evolution, or of the New Theol- ogy, is the god of pantheism. The Rev. John Wesley Conley, in a recent book, declares that t h e promise given through t h e apostle Paul that sometime w e shall see face to face a n d know even as also we are known, will be realized through psychical evolution. He says further that through the same proc-ess man will ultimately attain the power completely to control nature, and thus " become the crowned conqueror of the ages." Not Christ but man is to be-come, in this theory, the crowned con-queror of the ages. Do we not see from all this that evolution, or the New The-ology, is nothing more than the name of a religion under which man worships himself Å  the religion of humanism? Dr. Broda, who is popular as a lec-turer before college students, recently declared : " And so the theory of evo-lution gives a new conception of the uni-verse, a new conception of the aim of life, and provides a new theory of eth-ics, and is thus eminently fitted for be-coming the basis for a new manifestation of the religious spirit." The late Prof. William James, of Har-vard University, delivered a series of lec-tures, in 1909, at the Manchester Uni-versity, England, under the title, " The Present Situation in Philosophy." In one of these lectures he said : " Dualistic theism is professed as firmly as ever at all Catholic seats of learning, whereas it has of late years tended to disappear at our British and American universities, and to be replaced by a monistic panthe-ism more or less open or disguised." Now, dualistic theism is essentially Bible theism. The meaning of this technical phrase is that God is a separate, distinct entity, or per- sonality, and that the uni-verse, which he created, is another entity. Pt means that God is not only in his works, but above them and independ-         UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA, FOUNDED 1882, FRANKLIN B. GALT, PH. D., PRESIDENT ent of them. According t o this competent authority, the Catholic colleges are the only ones in which the testimony of Holy Writ regarding the creation and govern-ment of the universe, the origin of man and other living creatures, the genesis of evil, etc, are even professedly held. In the great colleges of England and Amer-ica monistic pantheism has supplanted Biblical or Christian theism. This means that in these institutions the students are taught that God and the universe, in-cluding man, are one and the same en-tity; that apart from the sensible cosmos there is no God. This is the theology of scientific evolution, and is virtually iden-tical with that of pantheism. Mr. Bolce tells us that the former pro-fessor of philosophy at the University of California rejects the belief that the suf-fering and death of Christ possess any efficacy as a means of human salvation. Instead of treating the divinity of Christ
