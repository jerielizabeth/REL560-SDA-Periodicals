THE WEST SHORE RAILROAD is ono of the most popular routes for business and pleasure travel, leading to and from New York City, as well as being the most substantially built and elegantly equipped double-track line, travers-ing, as it does, the west shore of the historic and world-famed Hudson River, and passing through the beautiful Mohawk Valley. By this route three express trains are run daily in each direction, between New York, Albany, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, and the West. The West Shore, in connection with the Fitch-burg Railroad, is also the shortest line between Boston and Chicago. Palace sleeping-cars are attached to these trains, and run through without change between the points named. Buffet smoking-cars, with revolving chairs, are a special feature of the splendid service on the West Shore. Tickets via West Shore can be purchased at ticket-offices of all connecting lines, and they are sold, and baggage checked through to destination from all stations of the West Shore Railroad.
