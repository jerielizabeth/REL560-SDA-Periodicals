394 AMERICAN SENTINEL. An Illustration of Papal Intolerance. BY JOHN MCCARTHY. WE hear much now-a-days of Catholic liberality. Papist historians, and theologians do their best to de-ceive the presentgeneration, by glossing over the barbar-Oils and unchristian acts of the Dark Ages, either by deny-ing papal responsibility for the same, or by falsifying the facts in such a manner as to make it appear that the victims were criminals of the vilest class, which disquali-fied them from being tolerated in any civilized society. We have before usla book by the Catholic bishop, Right Rev. John Milner, the "End of Religious Contro-versy," and in studying its pages we find that this com-plaisant bishop, tries to persuade his readers that the Roman Catholic Church never has persecuted those op-posed to her doctrines; never authorized persecution even in the most minor degree; and in fact has even dis-couraged all idea of employing force to win converts from the ranks of heresy. Ed. 1895: pages 320-335: To disprove and give the lie to such writers, we shall quote for the benefit of our readers, an incident of vital importance, to demonstrate how intolerant are the people who have been under the thumb of Rome for centuries. The republic of Peru is looked upon by the Papal See, as an exemplary republic, since the inhabitants of the same with rare exceptions, are members of her "communion." About eight years ago a friend of mine, the Rev. Penzotti, went to Peru to labor as a missionary and colporter, under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He, by consecrated labor sought to turn people from the obscurity of error, to the truth as it is in Jesus. Soon the zeal he manifested in doing his "Father's busi-ness," drew the attention of the Catholic priests to him,  and immediately they began to preach death and destruc-tion to all heretics. The fanatical populace, learning from their priests, that eternal rewards awaited all who should in any way maltreat, persecute, or kill the heretics, inaugurated a religious persecution against all who were favorable to the doctrines preached by the Rev. Penzotti; and not content with opposing the free preaching of the gospel, they actually sequestered all the Bibles and books of the aforementioned brother, and publicly burnt the same in the principal plaza. Now as is the case in nearly all strictly Catholic countries, the head ecclesiastical digni-taries, also occupy the principal judicial positions; so bigotry and fanaticism have an untrammelled course; so that after the priest in his capacity as "spiritual guide" of the people, advised the seizure of all "heretical books,',  and the persecution of the "heretical" invader, then the priest in his "judicial capacity" steps in to execute judg-ment against the disturber of the public peace, who had dared to disseminate "pernicious doctrines." Now as heretics in those poor, benighted countries, are counted of lower order than a thief or a murderer, one would expect that their degradation would be of a more  debasing character, than would be allotted to either of the above criminals. And such indeed transpired in the present case, since the priest-judge, *aid to confine our brother within the prison walls, in company with the other prisoners, lest he should follow Paul's example, and preach the gospel there, decided to isolate him; and ordered him to be kept within a place in which pigs had formerly been confined, with a guard near by to watch his every action. Thus was this good brother detained for nine months. This cruelty and savage treatment would have continued for a much longer period, had it not been for diplomatic intervention, which delivered him from the paws of the beast, that would have crushed out his very life. A Catholic journal or historian would tell you that such was not true; or if true, such an act was committed against the wishes of Santa Sede. But let me ask, why do priests seek to occupy political or judicial positions, if it is not to pros( cute those whom they fail to convert to their ideas by logical reasoning? Yes, this is the only reason; and in this way the Catholic Church can disclaim that she, as an ecclesiastical power, ever persecutes; but hides the fact that the same church dignataries in judicial capacities are guilty of such persecutions. Many Protestants(?) closing their eyes to these facts, clamour for a union with the "Mother Church"; to gain which end they are willing to surrender every prin-ciple of truth that is so precious to the true believer. But let them understand that Rome yields nothing; sheŠaccording to the dignitaries occupying the most exalted positionsŠnever changes; hence when she obtains the power to legislate as she did down in the middle ages; when the congresses and senates of the world are her slavish instruments, we may be confident of a re-enact-ment of the same diabolical methods as were then em-ployed, to compel by innumerable tortures all to ac-quiesce to this man-made, and anti-christian religion. Let not lethargy possess thee for a single moment my brother; be vigilant and valiant in the cause of truth; rally around the heavenly ensign carried by Jesus himself. It is true the conflict will be hottest there, it is also true that there are greater hardships for those who faithfully follow Jesus all the way, who will not compromise with error in the least degree; but only by fighting the good fight can we hope to overcome; and since only overcomers can ever enter the pearly gates of the Heavenly Jerusalem,  the Holy City, this involves upon us the duty, or better still the privilege, of fighting against the powers of dark-ness with the divinely-appointed weapons; by beating down tradition, error, and erroneous dogmas with the sword of truth; knowing that eventually we shall be "more than conquerors through Him that loved us." Buenos Ayres, Argentina. IT is said of Benjamin Franklin that to the end of his life he maintained that "there never was a good war."
