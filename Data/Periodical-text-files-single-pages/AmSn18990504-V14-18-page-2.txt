It is a strange thing, and as signifi-cant as it is strange. But there is a fact in connection with this that has not been mentioned, but which is vastly important; namely, the mills which are to be severely disciplined by the church and labor confederation are non-union mills. Is there any connection between the labor union's alli-ance with the church force, and the union's desire to discipline the non-union mills? There is a chapter of ancient history which can be very profitably read in connection with this account. And singularly enough, that, like this chapter of modern history, relates to the enforcement of Sunday laws. That chapter takes us back to the time of the Roman emperor Constantine. In Constantine's time the professors of Christianity had become a powerful party in the empire. Constan-tine, who was above all things else a diplomat, saw that this power was essential to his security upon the throne. He determined to profess Christianity. Upon this point Constantine said:Š "My father revered the Christian God, and uniformly prospered; while the emperors who worshipped the hea-then gods, died a miserable death; therefore, that I may enjoy a happy life and reign, I will imitate the example of my father, and join myself to the cause of the Chris-tians, who are growing daily, while the heathen are diminishing." In 321 A. n., just before his profession of Christianity, Constantine enacted a Sunday law,Šthe first Sunday law ever framed, and the beginning of all the Sunday legislation that has been passed through the centuries from his time down to the present. That law com-manded people in the cities and towns to rest on "the venerable day of the sun," but left people in the country places free to do Sunday work as usual. After his profession of Christianity, Constantine added to what he had done as a pagan emperor, in giv-ing his sanction to Sunday observance; and, says the historian, "By a law of the year 386, these older changes effected by the emperor Constantine were more rigor-ously enforced; and, in general, civil transactions of every kind on Sunday were strictly forbidden."ŠNeander. The bishops of the church in Constantine's day had become divided over points of doctrine, and there was a violent struggle between the opposing factions for the supremacy. By their disputes, says the historian, they made themselves dependent upon the emperor. Each faction sought alliance with the imperial power. They wanted the help of Constantine and the civil power; and Constantine, on the other hand, wanted the help of the church's powerful influence in carrying out his plans as emperor. Each side saw the opportunity for an alliance which would be to their mutual benefit; and accordingly *Schaff, "History of the Christian Church," Vol. III, § 2, par. 15. the thing was done. Constantine, quite naturally, took sides with the most powerful faction. This alliance continued after Constantine's death, and grew stronger and stronger; and the legal channel,  through which the civil power came into the hands of the church was the Sunday laws. Neander, the church historian, after enumerating the Sunday laws and edictsŁ  from the first one by Constantine down to a century later, says of them, "In this way the church received help from the state for the furtherance of her ends." t When the church is allied with the state, state and church have each a purpose of their own to serve by the alliance. That is the way it has always been, and will be until human nature changes. The secular unions of the present day represent the civil power. They are beginning to ally themselves with the church unions. They will have a purpose of their-own in this, and the church will have a purpose of her own. Each lends its aid to the other; and in this way the weapon of civil power will again be placed in the-hands of the church. That is what is coming; and that is the sinister-meaning of what is seen to-day in the alliance of church and state forces. • -4 A Self-Erected Obstacle. IN the Evangelist, Prof. Warren Clark writes upon "The Great Obstacle to the Progress of Christianity in,  Heathen Countries." He declares this great obstacle to-be "the inconsistency of Christians." Yet, when we come to read his article, this "inconsistency of Chris-tians" is not indeed the inconsistency of those who pro-fess to be Christians; but that which is counted the in-Consistency of the people who are not Christians at all,_ in their going from what are called Christian lands to what are called heathen countries, and acting there in a way unbecoming to Christians. He says that "to veterans long on the field [of misŠsionary work in heathen lands] the ingenuity is taxed to know how to answer the questions of heathen con-verts, as to why these rich and wealthy people from Christian lvads are indifferent to all religion." He speaks of having taken from Japan "two of our most-earnest Christian converts on a visit to the foreign resi-dent quarter of Yokohama," when "the first thing they saw in front of the English Episcopal Church, was a drunken British 'tar,' assaulting an equally intoxicated American sailor, and both of them were being arrested by it heathen Japanese policeman!" Further, he men-tions a Japanese student whom he met in London, and with whom he went around to see "the sights of the me-tropolis," and, "returning at night along the Strand t See Neander's "History or the Christian Religion and Church," Vol._ IL, sec. 3, part 2, div. 3.
