-- ≈Å The Capitol at Washington W here, During the Sixty-sixth Congress, Will Be Fought Out the Sunday-Law Issue tF LIBERT Y The chief difference between this pro-posed law and the Sunday blue law of Puritan New England, is that this law does not compel one " to attend divine services on Sunday, which the Sunday law of the established church of Puritan-ism did require of all adults and all but young children. The Sunday bill of the Pastors' Fed-eration and the Lord's Day Alliance will permit one to sit in an easy-chair at home all day on Sunday. Let us thank them for this privilege at least. But one is compelled to remain idle all day.

The First Amendment expressly states : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit-ing the free exercise thereof." Sunday is a religious institution, and its observance as a day of rest is an ecclesiastical obligation, although not a divine requirement. God commanded the seventh day to be observed, and not the first day of the week.
