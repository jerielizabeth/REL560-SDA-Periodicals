  "IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT." Jesus Christ.    VOLUME 15. NEW YORK, MARCH 22, 1900. NUMBER 12.          Published in the interests of Religious Liberty≈†Chris-tian and Constitutional. Wany one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it way know that it is sent by some friend. Therefore those who have not Ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay forit (Faltered at the New York Postoffice.) THE purpose of Christianity is never to cast men out of the world, but always to cast the world out of men. .4 .4 IT fs a bad sign when the clergy get more concerned for the suppression of crime than for the salvation of men from sin. IF you want a quiet Sabbath, spend the Sabbath day in the company of the "Lord of the Sabbath." You will find no occasion to complain of being "dis-turbed:" SEPARATED from religion, the state will never perse-cute; but joined with religion, the state will always persecute, because it will then be a party in a strife between opposing religions. As THE Creator certainly worked on the first day of the week, it is plain that the Sunday law, which pun-ishes men for following the Creator's example, virtually makes the Creator a criminal. A MAN may be perfect as measured by the best laws that men can enact and enforce, and yet be the worst sinner on earth, measured by the law of God. Right-eousness cannot be secured by human law. No LAW or act of a legislature can make wrong right, or absolve any person from obligation to con-form to the law of justice. Therefore the question, What is right? must always take precedence of the question, What is the law? THE civil government can deal with sin, if at all, only through its laws. But as God himself cannot deal with sin by law, even his perfect law, and still save the sinner, it is evident that no civil government has any business to try to deal with sin at all. However im-moral an act may be, if it is not an invasion of rights, it is outside the province of human law. Sunday Laws and "Works of Necessity and Charity." IN all the Sunday laws it is provided that the pro-hibition of work on Sunday shall not extend to "works of necessity and charity." This exemption gives the law a benevolent appearance, but in practise the ex-emption is never carried into effect. If it were, to the full extent of what "necessity and charity" demand,the law would be almost wholly robbed of its force. Consider, for example, the man who observes an-other day of rest than that specified in the law. He is held to this observance by the demands of his con-science, which he cannot set aside. So to observe the Sunday law,he must rest two days in the week, and lose one day every week which he would otherwise have for labor. ' This seriously interferes with his business. Is it a "necessity" that he should be successful in busi-ness? Being a poor man (as most men are in this day) he finds that he cannot get along successfully working only five days in the week. Is it a "necessity" that he have time enough for work so that he can "make both ends meet?" And would work done on Sunday to this
