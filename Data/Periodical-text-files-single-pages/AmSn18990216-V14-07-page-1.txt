NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 16, 1899. NUMBER 7. VOLUME 14. "IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT." Jesus Christ. THE NEW TEMPTATION ON THE MOUNTÅ "Behold, all this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me." THE United States stands upon a lofty summit of national greatness, and from this vantage ground the tempter presents all the glories of imperial-ism, which he will give simply in return for homage to himself. What matters it if the nation does overstep a few theories and principles, set up in the government a hundred years ago, when world-wide empire is to be gained or lost? This is the thought in the mind of Columbia, and she hesitates. What will be the decision? Will she say to the tempter, "Get thee behind me"? or will she put behind her the Constitution and Declaration of Inde-pendence, and bow to the dictates of Despotism? AN ounce of principle outweighs a pound of policy. IN the shadow of despotism, the principles of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence are dis-cerned but dimly. IF we have left the Constitution behind us, it is be-cause we have turned our backs upon it. THE pinnacle of greatness is dangerous standing ground for either an individual or a nation.
