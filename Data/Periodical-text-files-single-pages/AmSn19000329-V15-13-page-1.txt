  "IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, .1 JUDGE HIM NOT." Jesus Christ.     VOLUME 15. NEW YORK, MARCH 29, 1900. NUMBER 13.             Published in the interests of Religious LibertyŠChris-tian ;and Constitutional. SW Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it way know 'that it is sent by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay ford, (Entered at the New York Postoffice.) FORCE combined with religion always results in a retrograde movement. To UNITE religion with politics is not to elevate politics, but to degrade religion. .4 .4 As the state must always carry the sword of justice, It is plainly disqualified for service in the capacity of a missionary. THE truly Christian reformer will approach the peo-ple with the Word of God, and not presume to approach God with the word' of the people. .4 .4 GOOD laws are the result, not the cause, of right sentiment in the minds of the people. A true reform must begin with the people, not with the laws. .—4 As human law can represent no love but onlyjustiee, and Christianity cannot be separated from love, it folloWs that Christianity cannot be expressed in the form of law. THE Creator gave the Sabbath to all men "without money and without price;" but the Sunday laws have fixed a price upon it, and those who will not pay must be fined or sent to jail. RELIGIOUS truth has in all ages found its way op-posed by the barrier of religious legislation; and relig-ious legislation has always represented an effort to dam up the tide of progress in religious knowledge. THE state cannot be religious. The express purpose of religionŠthe gospelŠis to provide a way of escape for the transgressor; while the express purpose of the state in its laws against crime, its police, and its courts, is to close up every avenue of escape against the trans-gressor. Jt FROM its very nature, religious legislation must constitute a bond of union between the church and the world. "Slaves of What?" IN the "Shelden edition" of the Topeka Daily Capital considerable prominence was given to the subject of the desecration of Sunday. In one issue we note' the state-ment made by a railway employee that many employees of railway corporations are slaves. "We are slaves of what?" he inquires, and adds, "Sabbath desecration. It has come to be, violate the fourth commandment or starve." Now we ask our friends who believe in Sunday ob-servance as a religious duty, How much faith in God does such a statement reveal? A person must "violate the fourth commandment or starve." Who is it that keeps people alive? The Christian will at once answer, It is God. Then God, who keeps everybody alive, in-eluding railway employees, will let one of the latter continue to live only on condition that he violates the fourth commandment! That is what this man says, and what Mr. Sheldon's "Christian newspaper" prints as being the truth. Think of it: God will take care of you
