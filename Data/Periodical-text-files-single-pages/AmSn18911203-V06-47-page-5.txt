T14.8 AMERICAN SiNTINEL. 373 and think to wield the universe by human power, as to extinguish the moral illumina-tion of the Sabbath, and break the glori-ous mainspring of the moral government of God," and yet try to maintain religion or morality on the earth. True, Christ has said, " The Sabbath was made for man." So were baptism and the Lord's supper. The object of the Founder of the Sabbath was man's spirit-ual and religious welfare. Himself hath declared it. The Jews thwarted this object by the excessive strictness of their observance, making the Sabbath a bur-den; Christ's words were to correct that abuse, and they cannot be twisted into any other meaning. The Sabbath is for man, not for himself, for he has six days, but that he might use it to the glory of God; for that is the chief end of man. The combined voices of history, law, and Holy Writ present one mass of proof without a flaw, that the Sabbath is the holy day of God, and is purely religious in its origin, law, and observance, and cannot be anything else. Our Congress has declared it so; our courts avowedly enforce it as such. In statute language, " That the people may devote the day to rest, and to the worship of Almighty God." It is, then, beyond doubt or dis-pute, a purely religious institution, recog-nized and enforced as such. Mrs. Mary Clement Leavitt on "God in Government." " GOD in. Government " was the subject of a discourse by Mrs. Mary Clement Leavitt, Honorary Life President of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in Tremont Temple, Boston, Sun-day evening, Nov. 15. Mrs. Leavitt's text was Isa. 9: 6, 7 :Š For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoul-der: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. It is not the purpose of this article to follow the speaker in all her remarks on this text, but only to state the conclusion, and then examine briefly the text itself in the light of other scriptures, to ascertain whether it will bear the interpretation which Mrs. Leavitt put upon it. As briefly stated last week, Mrs. Leav-itt's position was that since the fall of man theocracy is the only proper form of gov-ernment ; and that like Israel until the time of Saul, the Commonwealth under Crom-well and the Colony of Massachusetts under the Puritans were governed by God. The words of her text already quoted, the speaker interpreted to be a prophecy of the rule of Christ over this world in its present physical condition, and in this dispensation; that is that Christ is to rule  this world through men, much as God is supposed to have ruled the Commonwealth through the stern and ambitious Cromwell, and the Colony of Massachusetts through the bigoted and intolerant Puritans. But how to bring this about Mrs. Leavitt did not seem to know. True, she thought that it must be done through political action, but at this point she appeared dazed at the magnitude of the undertak-ing, and pathetically asked " How are we going to put the government upon Christ's shoulder ? " That "we " have it to do was taken for granted, for the speaker said : " If God chose to do it he could do it at once; but that is not his plan." But in this statement Mrs. Leavitt was unfortunate, for her text says: " The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this "Šnot the zeal of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, nor even of the' whole Christian worldŠthe work is the Lord's, and he will perform it in his own time and in his own way. That Christ is to be this world's King, is clearly taught in the Scriptures: but that he is not now its king; and that he never will reign over it in its present con-dition, in the sense contemplated in Mrs. Leavitt's remarks, is just as plainly re-vealed. By comparing the promise to Abraham (Gen. 12 : 7, and parallel texts) with Romans 4 : 13, we learn that this world was promised to Abraham and to his seed: and in Gal. 3: 16 it is plainly declared that Christ is that seed to whom the promise was made, and through whom it will be fulfilled. That the promise was not fulfilled to Abraham we are told by both Stephen and Paul. The former de-clares (Act 7 : 5) that "he [God] gave him [Abraham] none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on ;" and in Hebrews 11 : 13,39, it is plainly stated that Abraham " died in faith, not having re-ceived the promise." But this is all in the plan of God. His promise has not failed. The time for its fulfillment has not yet come. The Saviour himself when on earthŠnot as a king but as a sacrifice for sinŠlikened himself to a nobleman going " into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to re-turn." Luke 19: 12-27. And he plainly declared that " When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." Matt. 25: 31. It is then, the Father having given him, as promised in the second psalm, the heathen for an inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession, that he breaks them with a rod of iron, and dashes them in pieces like a potter's ves-sel. Then shall the government be upon his shoulder, and " of the increase of his government there shall, be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his king-dom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from hence-forth even for ever;" and " THE ZEAL  OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL PER-FORM THIS." The plan of redemption as revealed in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is wonderfully comprehensive; it includes not only man but that which was in the beginning given to man for a possession, namely, the earth as it was when God saw that it was "very good." Of Christ the prophet has said : " And thou, 0 tower of the flock, stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem." Micah. 4: 8. The first dominion was of course the uncursed earth; for it was the domin-ion given to the first Adam when God said to him: " Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over -the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Gen. 7 : 28. This dominion Adam surrendered to Satan when he him-self by yielding to Satan, became his serv-ant. Says the apostle, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey ?" But God has made it possible for every man to escape from the service of Satan and become not merely a servant but a son of God, for it is written of Christ : "He came unto his own, and his own re-ceived him not. But unto as many as re-ceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." John 1:11, 12. But this action must be voluntary on the part of those who thus become sons. God leaves each man free to choose his service, or to refuse it and to continue in the service of Satan; for God wants, and will have, only willing and truly loyal subjects. The time is coming, however, when the kingdom will be given to Christ, who, by wearing the crown of thorns, redeemed the earth from the curse, just as by tasting death for every man he pur-chased for every man a resurrection from the dead. And as he is coming to ran- som man from the power of the grave, and to clothe with immortality those who have given him their hearts, so he is com-ing to purify the earth and to restore it to its Eden beauty; and so it is written: " We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 Peter 3 : 13. The promise of the new earth is the Lord's, and it is for him to fulfill it in his own time. As Mrs. Leavitt says, he could do it at once if he chose, but that is not his plan. Neither is it his plan to place the government upon the shoulder of Christ through human instrumentality. " The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this." All that any one can do in the matter is to submit to God and so become a subject of that glorious kingdom pre-pared for man from the foundation of the world, but for a time usurped by Satan, and finally to be wrested from him by the Lord Jesus Christ, who will reign over it forever, even for ever and ever.
