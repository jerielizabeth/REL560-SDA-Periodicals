Liberty Magazine W' Religious Freedom Devoted to the American idea of Religious Liberty Ex-emplified in the Complete Separation of Church and State THE LEGASPI MONUMENT, MANILA, P. I. King Philip, of Spain, sent Legaspi to engage in the conquest of these islands in 1564. He was moved by religious motives. With Legaspi came a friar of the order of St. Augustine, Andres de Urdaneta, as director of the spiritual conquest. In the monument they stand side by side, Legaspi with his sword, representing the state, and Urdaneta with the cross and Bible, representing the church. The history of the Philippines, written in blood, testifies to the baneful results of the union of church and state. The Meaning of Religious Legislation PRICE, FIVE CENTS
