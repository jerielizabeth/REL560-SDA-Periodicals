NarriTiTITI t,fiTit  111'110 LIBERTY VIEW OF THE COURTYARD OF THE SEMINARY OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, VIGAN, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, WHERE IN JANUARY, 1914, SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY BIBLES, IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, WERE PUBLICLY BURNED BY THE PRIESTS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH forth the cause of the revolutions in the Philippines, places the blame upon the Catholic hierarchy because of their ex-ploitation of the people through political intrigues. And yet the Western Watch-man (Catholic) vilifies Protestantism in the following scathing language : Š " The unchurched and unsexed millions who disgrace every civilized land are the waifs of the Reformation. The disrupted homes, morgues of plighted love, are the handiwork of the Reformation. The debauchery in high and low life in every land where Protestant-ism holds sway attests the general loosening of bonds,of morality caused by the Reforma-tion. Protestantism has become the synonym' or unbridled lust, domestic infidelity, and ir-religion throughout the world. . . " Protestantism is par excellence the religion of dirt. When it disappears, there will be a monster Augean stable to clean out; and the nations will feel relieved of a plague that ' threatened to last forever. The world is vile and sinful; but filthy as it is, it is far too pure for Protestantism! "Š Western Watch- . man, Sept. 26, 1912. Such language sounds strange in view of a bill which was introduced into the present session of Congress by a Roman Catholic Congressman from Boston, ask-ing Congress to empower the Postmaster- General to exclude from the mails all publications which " attack a recognized religion held by citizens of the United States, or any religious order to which citizens of the United States belong." Judging from the quotation from the Western Watchman, the Catholic Church does not regard Protestantism as having any status at all as a religion, for Cath-olics claim the right to attack Protestant-ism, but Protestants are to be deprived of the right to criticize Catholicism. We are wondering what Catholicism proposes to do with Protestants when its object " to make America dominantly Catholic " is realized. Will Catholics do for Amer-ica what they did for the Philippines, as set forth in the Congressional report? SK sV 1): GEORGIA has now an inspection law, which makes it the duty of the grand jury to inspect convents, orphan asy-lums, private schools, etc., and to give each inmate opportunity to state whether he or she is held under duress or not. The Roman Catholics are much opposed to inspection laws; but why?
