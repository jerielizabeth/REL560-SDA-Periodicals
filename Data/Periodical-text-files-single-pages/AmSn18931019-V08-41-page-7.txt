THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PLAN OF SALVATION By "an American Citizen" Is something that every Christian ought to read. It is a val-uable book, though not entirely free from remarks which indi-cate wrong ideas. But as these occur only incidentally, and are in no sense essential to the author's course of reasoning, they are unimportant. The book can be safely put into the hands of any one, and would be especially valuable in dealing with the candid skeptic. Nearly 200 pages, Bound in Cloth. ŠPrice 25 cents.-- Any of the above will be sent post-paid on receipt of price. Address Pacific Press, 43 Bond Street, New York City. CHRISTIAN LIFE SERIES. Four excellent books of which we can give no better idea than by quoting the table of contents of one. The first, "Chris-tian Living," contains nine chapters, as follows:Š I. The Appropriation of Christ. II. Christ's Proprietorship. III. Reciprocal Indwelling. IV. "Sins" and "Sins." V. The Will. VI. Guidance. VII. The Fullness of the Spirit. VIII, Our Work for Christ. IX. Concluding Words. The second book of this series, "The Present Tense of the Blessed Life," has seventeen chapters and treats of the many promises of present help and blessing. The Christian should live in the present as well as for the future. Jesus not only promises future salvation but he gives present victory. The Future Tense of the Blessed Life," deals with promises of future blessirgs. The first chapter is "A Cluster of Grapes;" the text is Zeph. 3: 17. "The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice oVer thee with 'joy"; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing." Truly this is a rich cluster of promises. The title of the remaining book, "The Shepherd Psalm," will sufl.ciently explain to every Christian the character of this volume. What follower of Christ is not familiar with the Twenty-Third Psalm and where is the trusting Christian who does not love to dwell upon it ? About one hundred and sixty pages each, bound in blue vel-lum cloth, 50 cents each, or four for $1.75. FATHERS OF THE CIETETWIEtCHE BY E. J. WAGGONER. History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the princi-ples of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adop-tion of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of pa-ganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book. Fine English cloth,sub-stantially bound, contains about 400 pages, and will be sent post-paid for $1.00.

I have for three years used the " Health Foods" in my family, and can heartily recommend them, both for purity and health- giving properties. C. F. PORTER, D. D. S. INDIANA. Your " Health Foods " are the wonder of the nineteenth century. I have used Granola but a short time, but have already experienced relief from indigestion and acid, or flatulent dyspepsia.. I also find the Zwiebach nourishing and toothsome. D. M. KAUFFMAN. I have personally tested your excellent food known as Granola. It is highly pleasing to the taste, easy of digestion, and the most nutritive cereal production with which I am acquainted. DR. R. W. BULA. NEW YORK. Your Granola is the best selling invalid food I have ever handled. I have already sold nearly two thousand pounds. A. J. BROUGHTON. CONNECTICUT. We have used your "Health Foods" in our family for three years, and can not get along without them. Having been troubled with dyspepsia and chronic inflammation of the stomach, I find that your Granola, Avenola, Wheatena, and Gluten are the only foods that I can eat with safety. Ws. M. MERWIN. OHIO. Our baby is a testimonial to Sanitarium food. She is ten months old, weighs twenty-eight pounds, and is as ruddy and healthy a specimen as can be seen. She has actually gained flesh while cutting her last two teeth. Her flesh is firm and sound, and she is very strong. FRED. L. ROSEMOND. MINNESOTA. We have twins, and the little fellows are thriving nicely. The food agrees with them perfectly, and I have recommended it to many who are bringing up babies " by hand." D. W. MCCOURT.
