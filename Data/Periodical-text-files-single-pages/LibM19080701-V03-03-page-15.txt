LIBERTY  13 order that those who wish to use it " for religious purposes can do so without dis-turbance, and those who would make the clay a corrupting day may be held in check," is wholly inconsistent with the nature of " a legal holiday." Thanks-giving is a legal holiday, and a day on which it is recommended that special re-ligious services should be held, but no " special protection " has yet been de-manded lest some should make the day "a corrupting day." Lent covers a period of six weeks, during which daily relig-ious services are held both in Episcopal and Roman Catholic places of worship, but it has not been deemed necessary to provide " special protection " for this time of religious observances. The only explanation of this difference is that there are some misguided persons who under the plea of securing " a legal holi-day," are demanding enforced respect for a religious institution, contrary to the very fundamental principle of religious liberty. No man has a right to declaim about religious liberty who is not willing to grant to every man the right not to believe and not to worship, and who is not willing to refrain from any attempt to compel unbelievers to act as if they believed, or to compel non-worshipers to assume, in some degree at least, the same attitude toward a religious observance as is assumed by worshipers. Furthermore, it is not true that where such " special protection " as is de-manded by Sunday law advocates has been granted " citizens may make the day a holy day or holiday, or partly a holy day and partly a holiday, according to their consciences or tastes." Under ex-isting State Sunday laws in this country peaceable and inoffensive citizens have been arrested and convicted as criminals for working quietly in a field far re- moved from any dwelling house; for re-pairing a fence by the side of a rarely used road, in order to protect growing  crops against straying cattle; for paint-ing the back side of a building entirely out of sight of all passers-by; and for other similar acts which could by no pos-sible stretch of imagination be regarded as improper on " a legal holiday." The first draft of the Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, which was passed by the United States Senate, dur-ing the recent session of Congress, and is now pending in the House of Repre-sentatives, made it " unlawful for any person to engage in fishing," but in what way could this quiet pastime possibly dis-turb those who wish to use the day for religious purposes ? Religious, not Civil The fact is that it is utterly impossible to defend Sunday laws upon any other than religious grounds, and an attempt to justify them on a civil basis leads to just such inconsistencies as were in-dulged in by the Christian Advocate. It makes no difference whether the relig-ious observance is based upon a definite command or whether it rests, like the Sunday institution, upon tradition and the authority of the church. It is not within the province of civil government to determine whether a religious institu-tion rests upon a sufficient basis, or whether a person endangers the salva-tion of his soul by refusing to pay due regard to church observances. It is the duty of the state to protect all its citizens in their right to assemble peaceably, and to hold a public meeting for any proper purpose on any day of the week, and in their right to practise or to refrain from practising any form of religion, so long as in so doing they do not interfere with the equal rights of other citizens, but further than this, the state can not go without committing itself to become the judge in religious matters and to become an oppressor of a portion of its citizens, by granting special privileges to one class which are withheld from another.
