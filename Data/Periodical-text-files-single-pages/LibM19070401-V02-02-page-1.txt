Liberty tit Magazine e Religious Freedom Devoted to the American idea of Religious Liberty Ex-emplified in the Complete Separation of Church and State Faneuil Hall Number LANDING OF THE PILGRIMS AT PLYMOUTH ROCK, 1620 It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment upon our lib-erties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it.Å  James Madison. PRICE, FIVE CENTS
