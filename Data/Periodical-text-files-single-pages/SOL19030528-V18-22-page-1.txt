The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY   NEW YORK, MAY 28, 1903  NO. 22 VOL. XVIII          The Constitution of the United States I regards the con-science of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian. . . The Christian religion made its way into the world in opposition to all human governments. Banishment, tor-tures and death were inflicted to stop its progress. But many of its professors, as soon as clothed with political power, lost the meek spirit which their creed inculcated, and began to inflict on other religions, and on dissenting sects of their own religion, persecutions more aggravated than those which their own apostles had endured. ŠFrom United States House of Representatives' Committee Report on "Sunday Mails" (1830), written by Col. Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky. The long, unremitting tragedy of Christendom's brutali-ties against the Jewish people, lasting in some parts of Europe until now, constitutes one of the blackest pages of the world's history. There is not a form of torture, by fire, or cross, or knife, or dungeon, or starvation, which has not been inflicted in Christian so-called] countries upon Jews because some of their ancestors were officially re-sponsible for the death of Jesus; not a humiliation, not an indignity which has not been heaped upon them in the name of Him whose last words were, "Father, forgive them." ŠFrom recent sermon by Dr. Geo. A. Thayer (Unitarian) in Cincinnati.
