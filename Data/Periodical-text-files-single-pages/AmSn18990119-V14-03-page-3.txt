AMERICAN SENTINEL. 35 intent and spirit of the Constitution, if not to the letter of it. And to go contrary to the spirit of the Constitu-tion is in effect an actual repudiation of it. The practi-cal result is not altered by mere technicalities which provide a loophole of escape from the charge of violating the exact letter of the law. And under the lead of the imperialists and the religio-political associations, the nation to-day is fast repudi-ating every principle of republican government. The Army Chaplain. BY R. M. KILGORE. THIS adjunct to the army and navy of the United States is like the mistletoe, which grows and flourishes while attached to the tree from which it draws its life, though it is no part of the tree, and does not belong to it. This official, commissioned by the Government to minister to the spiritual needs of the soldiers, draws his salary not from those to whom he ministers, but from the State. In this union of church and state, he is not a free man to reprove and rebuke sin. He is compelled to shut his eyes to much that he knows is evil. Chaplain McIntyre, at Denver, was court-martialed and dismissed from service because his speech was not respectful toward an officer outranking him. He accepted the position and should not complain at the treatment which such relations and conditions forces upon him. The chaplain holds a joint commissionŠfrom Heaven and the United StatesŠand by virtue of the first he ob-tains the second. By accepting the latter he must sur-render the advantages and power granted to him under the former. The authority and emoluments embodied in the commission from Heaven must be greater than those conferred by any earthly power. The servant of God who is not fettered by office, rank, or station, is free. His mouth is not muzzled in the presence of captain, admiral, president, or king. Nathan entrapped David, caused him to declare his own sentence of condemnation, and with "Thou art the man," exposed him before the world, as the guilty one. The king humbled himself, confessed his sin, and the ser-vant of God was not answerable to any earthly court. An image was erected on the plain of Dura, and all the people were commanded to fall down and worship it. Three humble servants of God were brought before King Nebuchadnezzar to answer for their refusal to comply with the earthly mandate. Their indifferent reply, "Be it known unto thee, 0 king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up," enraged the king; they were cast into the furnace of fire heated seven times hotter than it had been before. A higher power annulled the king's decree, reversed the penalty, and the men who trusted in their God were  brought forth with no smell of fire upon them, and not a hair of their heads was singed. These servants of God, instead of being discharged for their disrespect of the king's order, were then "promoted" to a higher position "in the province of Babylon." When Christ was commanded, "Get thee out, and de-part hence," and threatened with death at the hands of Herod, his reply to the Pharisees was, "Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I castlout devils, and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected. Nevertheless I must walk to-day and to-morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem." This language Herod doubtless regarded as disrespectful, while Christ, as a servant of a higher power, continued prosecuting his work, without interrup-tion or intimidation. The Jewish Council could arrest, threaten, and com-mand Peter and John "not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus," and their reply, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye," doubtless startled the rulers; while such intrepidity and daring conduct bewildered them, and wrung from them the question, "What shall we do to these men?" Had these ministers of the gospel held com-missions from the Government, they could have been withdrawn, and they, in disgrace, dismissed from the service. But being po werless to close the mouths of these men they let them go, and being let go they boldly pro-claimed their message from heaven. Ł Our experience with army chaplains for more than three years in the service of the United States creates a doubt in our mind as to the utility of such an append-age. Their opportunities for doing gospel work are greatly hampered, if they are true men, burdened for the souls under their charge. If they are not, then they are a by-word among the rank and file, and a reproach to the name of Christ. Here is a department, in this union of church and state, which might be abolished. A ministry paid by the State becomes contaminated by its environments and conditions. It cannot remain pure. The Rev. Sam Small, in an interview at Savannah, Ga., while on his way to Cuba, to enter upon his duties as chaplain of the Third Engineers' United States army, expressed, in a terse manner, the proper view of this sub-ject. He said:Š "The chaplains are a sort of sop to the church sentiŁ ment without much substance to them. They just take a minister and put a uniform on him with a silver cross on the shoulder, pay him $200 a month and turn him loose on 1,200 men, without any of the implements of the spiritual warfare to fight with. I've been disap-pointed. "When I get out I am going to suggest that they do away with the chaplains. I suppose there will be a howl, but it is better to raise the issue and have the whole sys-tem revised. When we get down to Cuba wager most of the men would rather go to a cock fight or a bull ring than attend services. To tell the truth, I am beginning to think there is a heap of balderdash about what the
