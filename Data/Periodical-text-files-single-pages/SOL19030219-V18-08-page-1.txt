I have often expressed my sentiments that every man, con-ducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be protected in worshiping the Deity according to the dictates of his own conscience. The liberty enjoyed by the people of these States, of wor-shiping Almighty God, agreeably to their consciences, is not only among the choicest of their blessings, but also of their rights. While men perform their social duties faithfully, they do  all that society or the state can with propriety demand or expect; and remain responsible only to their Maker for the religion, or mode of faith, which they may prefer or profess. The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people. Toward the preservation of your Govenment and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppo-sitions to,  its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles,  however specious the pretexts.
