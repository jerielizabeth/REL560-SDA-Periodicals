AMER, ICA.N SENTINEL. 77 would have depended on tradition, would have excluded the gentile as a dog; but now he lays aside his preju-dices, is convinced by the word of God, and obeys, relying on divine power. Cornelius, also, had to lay aside his gentile prejudice, and submit, too, to God's word. What unity this Word ordains for men, breaking down the middle wall of partition between soul and soul, that the prayer of Christ may be answered, `that they may be one in us.' " "There is a verse here that is truly sublime in its declaration, as Peter's conclusion, drawn from his vision and the sequel. fie says: ' Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness is accepted of him."' " What further evidence did Peter receive that dem-onstrated this principle ? " " Why, further on in the chapter, it is said that the Holy Spirit fell on Cornelius and his household, and that they heard them magnify God. Peter was fully con-vinced, and said, `Can any man forbid water, that these, should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?' " "His test for discipleship was not the observance of some Jewish rite, enforced by law. Divine power wit-nessed to the fact that Cornelius was a child of God. How much better that God should witness by divine power than that men should declare who is and who is not righteous by the test of mere outward act, insisted on by civil power!" " Perhaps everyone would not have recognized the work of the Holy Spirit, and for failure to observe the rite, would send to prison and to death, those whom God acknowledged." "That's the very point, Cecil. The very reason why the devil wants to put civil power in the hands of a fallen church is to persecute those who depend on God." F. E.
