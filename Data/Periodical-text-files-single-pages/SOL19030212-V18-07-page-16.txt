SIXTY=SEVEN BIBLES AT LESS THAN COST SOME five years ago we bought nearly a thousand Bibles which we offered as premiums with the "American Sentinel." Before the entire stock was disposed of the "Sentinel" was moved to Chicago, but we still had the Bibles. These have been selling slowly since but we still have sixty-seven of them left. We are not now offer-ing Bible premiums, hence these few have never been sold. This Bible contains large type. It is a Self-Pronouncing Combination Reference Bible. tat BY SELF-PRONOUNCING we mean that every proper name is divided into syllables with accents and diacritical marks, enabling the reader to pronounce with ease the most difficult words. BY " COMBINATION " we mean that the reader has before him both the old and new versions at once, where the revised differs from the old, the revised rendering being found by convenient reference to foot- not n. THE BINDING is of leather called Tampico Morocco, the covers lined with leather to the edge, divinity circuit, red under fine gold edges, round corners, silk head band, silk marker. This Bible and a yearly subscription to the " American Sentinel " sold for Â£3.50, and was considered a bargain at that price. To make a quick work of these sixty-seven copies we have decided to close them out at the extremely low price of $1.50 - Postpaid. This is considerably less money than we originally paid for them. After this stock is sold there will be no more, so ORDER TO-DAY. Address with remittance PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING COMPANY, 11 WEST 20th STREET, - NEW YORK CITY.
