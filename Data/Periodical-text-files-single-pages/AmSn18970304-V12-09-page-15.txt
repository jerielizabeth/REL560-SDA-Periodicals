THIS'iS ONE OF THE VERY BEST BOOKS THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN ON THE RELATION OF THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION. It shows how Christianity advanced in the Roman Empire, not only without the aid of the State, but in the face of the bitterest opposition from the State; it discusses what the Christian-should render to God, and what to the State, and how the powers that be are ordained of God. The book then takes up the history and principles of the movement so active now is the United States, looking toward having the Church try to regulate and cleanse politics, and shows what will be the certain results of following the policy advocated by some of these church men. No matter what your views upon this question, you cannot afford to miss reading this book. Cloth, 378 pp., . $1.00. Paper Covers, . . . . .40.
