I have read the MS. of Prof. E. A. Sutherland's new book, "Living Fountains or Broken Cisterns, an Educational Prob-lem for Protestants," and I am convinced that it is the book for our churches and our schools. Everyone who reads the book must be convinced that there are now two systems of education ; one Christian and the other Pagan. The one leading to the knowledge of God and the other to doubt and infidelity. L. A. HOOPES, Sec. Gen. Conf.
