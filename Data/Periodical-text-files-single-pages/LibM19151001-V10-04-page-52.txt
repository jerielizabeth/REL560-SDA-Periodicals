THE MODERN UZZAH " And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it I" stumbled," margin). And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God." 2 Sam. 6: 6, 7. The ark of God needed no such human support then, nor does God's cause need any such support now. All such miscredited zeal is dishonoring to him who seeks and accepts only the service of love, saying, " My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my command-ments." Prov. 3: 1. Again, " My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways." Prov. 23: 26. And finally, " The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Rev. 22: 17.
