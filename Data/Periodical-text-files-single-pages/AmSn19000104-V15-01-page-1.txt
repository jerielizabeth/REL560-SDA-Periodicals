SgrAny one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it v know that it is sent by some friend. Therefore those who have not ,red the. Sentinel need have nolears that they will be asked to .nay forit, (Entered at the New York Postoifice.) THE conscience can acknowledgeno master but God ,alone. Je No MORAL question can be settled by ballot, or by vote of the legislature. ttt ANY scheme which makes one man morally account-able to another man, or set of men, is popery; and no enich scheme can be any better than the papacy. tAg THE scheme to have the Constitution "acknowledge God" is really a scheme to have that document acknowl-edge the theocrats back of this scheme as the moral rulers of the nation. eg THE agencies of the divine government are not human, but invisible spiritual agencies which proceed from the throne of God. With their appointment man can have nothing to do. THE true acknowledgment of God is always made in Šlie. individual heart,  and if God be not acknowledged ,in the hearts of the people, any outward acknowledg tiont of him is only hypocrisy and sin. ot WE lifq-e-been told that "this is a Christian nation;" but we have never been;pointedto the tithe whem it was  baptized, or the occasion when it was "born again," or to any evidence that it is "crucified with Christ," or, that it exists to serve rather than ,to be served. "GOVERNMENT of the people, by the people," is responsible alone to the people; the creature is respon-sible alone to its creator. God is the Creator of the people, and they are responsible to him; but directly, as individuals, and not through some creature which they may bring forth. "THE kingdom of God is within you," said Jesus Christ; hence the throne of God is in the Christian's heart, and the voice that speaks from it is the voice of God. And any attempt to set up a national conscience over the individual conscience is an attempt to drive God from his throne in the heart, and set him upon a man-made throne in the State. The New Interpreters of the Constitution. WHEN the Constitution of the United States was established, its provisions fixing the total separatiOn' between religion and the state made it essentially 4is-tinct from all views held by the Catholic Church on the subject of religion and the state. This was essentially the Protestant and Christian principle established as the fundamental and supreme law of this nation. As such the papacy looked upon it, and therefore‚  refused to acknowledge the Government as a true government., Accordingly in the Catholic World of September.,1871.,,Ł the leadiiig Catholic writer in the United. States at that-;.  time 'referred to 'the Constitution and GovernmeltŁO. the United States as follows:Š , "As it is interpreted . . . by the.
