504 AMERICAN SENTINEL. Items of W. C. T. U. History. BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY. A WORK so far reaching as that of the W. C. T. U. could not be carried on without touching many other organizations, and without more or less of affiliation with many that might or might not both help and hin der. As a Christian body we were necessarily allied to every church organization in the land. In fact it is ex- pected that every cluster of religious denominations in the midst of which a local union is found, will have among its vice-presidents one woman from each, the es- pecial duty of whom it shall be to look after the temper. ance work in that church. As a temperance organiza-tion, we of course, touch every temperance society in the world, and have affiliations more or less with them all, and are largely concerned in all the methods by which they are seeking to carry forward any temperance pro-ject, and every department is as a sort of hook by which we lay hold of some body of specialists in some philan-thropic line, or which is appropriated by some such body, to hang something on, in which they think we ought to become interested and keep in mind. The Sabbath department was soon seized upon as such a hook or peg. I do not use this expression in any way that can be considered offensive. I do not charge any with the effort to make use of the W. C. T. U. as a tool; but there were questions involved in this depart-ment that, as in some others, led into the legal world from which women were excluded. We could not crys-talize our convictions into law, even when law was right, and when our convictions were needed in legislation; and naturally appealed to those who, as we honestly thought, could carry the work along to the point of successful issue by the 'power of the ballot. In our evangelistic work by the use of the Word of God we endeavored to bring those who had the la w-mak-ing-power to right convictions, and then left them to vote those convictions at the next election, the one right thing to do; but, to do which, requires an un-derstand;,-g of what the Word of God really teaches, for it is a serious thing to handle the Word of God to such an end without knowing just what one is doing. Our women had seen the principle of prohibition all right, and always used it as opposed to license; that is, we denied the right of any body of legislators to make a law that would give any man the legal right to commit  - any wrong against his fellow-man; and as a rule those women, and men as well, who believe in the enforcement of Sunday laws, do so upon the supposition that every man absolutely needs one day in seven as a rest day, and that anything that infringes on that is a legitimate sub- ject for the civil law. It is not for the protection of the Sabbath of the Lord, nor the "Lord's Day," but man's rest day, that the W. C. T. U. have asked the aid of the voting power of the nation. And I am glad to say that with all my heart I believe that the men who have organized to secure these ends are honest in their efforts, believing just as I once did that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that every man has need of one day of rest in the seven, and also a right to a quiet rest day; these brethren are only working out their earnest convictions in trying to rescue Sunday from just as much of noise and unrest as is possible. Their activities, as well as those of the W. C. T. U. along this line are the result of a heroic faith that God will stand by the truth. Their mistake is in a failure to see the truth concerning the binding nature of the command-ment to keep the especial day that God has named as well as hallowed; an error which can never be corrected by any argument of any description, but only by the il-lumination of the Holy Spirit of God; and those who hope to be used as a medium of illumination must at least be willing to recognize honesty and candor in the convictions of others. The point upon which the W. C. T.U. especially needs to be enlightened is the inconsistency of their position as a professedly unsectarian body with a great department given wholly to the work of promulgating and enforcing a dogmatic section of a man made creed, in defiance of the protest of many of those who have been in the or-ganization from the beginning, and have just as great an interest in its legitimate temperance, educational and rescue work, as any advocates of the Sabbath Observ-ance Department can possibly have, and just as good a right to have their convictions regarded, as though they were not in the minority; for it is not supposed that among Christians a case involving principle is ever to be decided by a majority vote, but by that which is clearly right. It is clearly right that the W. C. T. U. should be con-sistent with itself; and that it should either so change the Sabbath Observance Department as to entirely re-move its sectarian features, or else change the policy of the organization so as to make it an avowedly Sunday. keeping body with Sunday-keeping as a test of member-ship as total abstinence now is. I do not believe this would ever be possible, and I do so firmly believe in the honesty of purpose, which is the inspiration of all the efforts put forth by both the men of the National Reform Association and my White Ribbon Sisters, that I must believe that sooner or later by the light of the Holy Spirit they will yet see these truths, and wonder as I now do, with reference to myself, how they could ever have been so blind. shall be dissolved," and the only hope of individuals will be that each one has built for himself upon the surafoun-dation, and "other foundation can no man lay that than is laid, which is Jesus Christ." PROSPERITY and immunity from harm are not the only evidences of God's goodness to his creatures. ,.S.~.
