History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know how to avoid error in the future must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the con-dition of the heatlieo world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these PrilidiPles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of Mire Christianity, developed the. Papacy, which was simply a new phase of paganism. It shows that by, the time Of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power.

JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR DECEMBER 13, 1888. Mr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING." And Mr. Jones' comments make it more so.
