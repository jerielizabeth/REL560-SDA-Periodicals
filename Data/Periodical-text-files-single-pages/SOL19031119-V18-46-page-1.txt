RELIGON AND PUBLIC EDUCATION ISSUE PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR Th Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., NOVEMBER 19, 1903 NO. 46 I'warn you, and all who hear mylvords, and all 'who read them, that there is a great conspiracy going on in this country, 'working underhand, pressing, crowding in every direction, taking advantage of every turn of the tide, against our pub- lic schools. Pressure is being exerted all the time in favor of sectarian religious education; and I 'warn you that this is one of the great battles of American civilization that has got to be fought out before a great 'while. If you take public money for the education of the children, you ha%'e no right to use it except to educate those children in such a 'way as will most benefit the public. The only excuse for public education is the public weal. The public schools, then, should be de7,oted entirely to educating people for fitness for good American citizenship. Let the Catholics, the Unitarians, the Baptists, the Episcopalians, the Presbyterians, educate their children into their own ideas in their homes and their churches and their private institutions just as much as they 'willŠthey have a perfect right to do it; but do not let them dare to ask for public money to carry on sectarian education. I beg you to think of this important question; for 'we shall have to  think of it, and think of it seriously, before a great 'while. Š Dr. Minot J. Sabage in discourse in New York on October 18.  (A.
