THE _AJMERICAN SENTINEL. 15 regard to railroad work on the Sabbath day, be rigidly enforced. "Resolved further. That the chief of police is hereby specially instructed to carry out the pro-visions of the above resolution, and see that cases are made against the officials that issue orders for work to be done on Sunday contrary to law. "Saturday night Chief Connolly instructed the captains and officers in charge of the force to strictly enforce the provisions of the resolution. Sunday, several engines were held up, and their crews taken in charge by the police. To say that they were indignant is no exaggeration of the fact. ." During the day, several times, the yard super-visors and others in charge were at the police sta-tion exhibiting permits and reciting their instruc-tions from headquarters, but they were valueless, as the recent resolution adopted in the council an-nulled all permits. The orders from headquarters didn't go with the police department. " The railroad officials declare that the ordinance is an unjust interference with their business, that it obstructs commerce, and is uncalled for." THE Chicago Daily Times has this interesting editorial note: " The act of a Kansas Court in granting an in-junction to restrain the issuance of certain school bonds voted on Saturday, the plea of the petitioners being that two-thirds of the qualified voters of the district are Seventh-day Baptists and were virtually disfranchised by the election being held on their holy day, is a notable contribution to judicial prec-edent. It appears that the school-district trustees intend to accept the decision without appeal, which is unfortunate, as the question is one which should be definitely determined by the decision of a court of last resort. It involves, evidently, not the question at issue alone, but equally, the right of law-making bodies to force the observance of Sunday upon those whose reli-gious faith impels them to refrain from mundane activity on SaturdayŠthe true Sabbath. With the evident tendency of modern life to open wide the gates of pleasure on Sunday, and the increasing ac-tivity of the Sabbatarians in opposition to this irre-. sistible tendency, it would be well to have the legal aspect of the question clearly and authorita-tively defined. " IN the Religious Liberty column of THE SENTINEL for Dec. 17, some criticisms of the Statesman and its new management which appeared in, the Chris-tian Nation, were quoted. The Nation feels ag-grieved at the reappearance of its own words and puts this estimate upon their force: "The issues, just at hand, of two little papersŠthe Advocate and Ensign, of Philadelphia, and THE AMERICAN SENTI-NEL, of New YorkŠin their references to this journal remind us of the old song about the mosquito attacking the elephant. The mosquito got his bat-tering ram smashed, but the elephant wasn't hurt; and from some things which these little papers have said it would seem as though they too, poor misguided things, have suffered by collision with the larger body, and that their buzzing is now of the nature of loquacity without capacity." THE fining of theatrical managers for giving en-tertainments on Sunday, still continues in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In many cases, no doubt, -these exhibitions might well be dispensed with entirely, but, even if that be the case, Sunday closing only will not perceptibly improve civil order, any more than Monday or Saturday closing. The only way to effect the result desired is that which is said to have been used in Minneapolis; simply not to pat-ronize them. YPSILANTI, Michigan, is reported as having re-recently passed a stringent Sunday ordinance and begun the campaign of municipal evangelization by converting the Italian fruit dealers.
