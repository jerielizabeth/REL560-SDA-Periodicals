HOW CHRIST ANSWERED THE PHARISEES AND HERODIANS - OF HIS DAY " They sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, say-ing, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? But Jesus perceived their wick-edness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they say unto him, Caesar's. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Ca.sar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22: 46-21.-
