SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT 251 or shrouding material, newspapers, ice, ice cream, milk, nor the sending of tele-graph or telephone messages at any hour of the day, nor to keepers of drug stores, hotels, or boarding houses, restaurants, livery stables, bath houses, or ice dealers, nor to telegraph or telephone officers; nor to the sale of drugs or medicines, nor to the sale of intoxicating liquors upon the prescription of a regular practising physician." Five retail liquor dealers of Winsboro, Texas, which we suppose includes all the dealers in that city, have entered into a contract extending to January 1, next, not to sell intoxicants on Sunday nor to allow persons to enter their places of business on that clay. "Believing," runs the contract, "in the enforcement of the Sunday laws of this State, according to the letter and the spirit thereof, we here-by agree and contract with each other that we will not give away, or permit to be given away, to any person or persons on any Sunday hereafter any whiskey, wine, beer or≈Åother intoxicant, and we will not allow any person or persons to enter on any Sunday any of our present places of business, or places of business in which we may hereafter become finan-cially interested, and we will not sell to any person or persons on any Sunday, any whiskey, wine, beer or other intoxi-cant for cash or otherwise. This contract is intended to prohibit the entrance into the said places of business, provided that this contract shall not prohibit any of the contracting parties hereto, from selling whiskey, wine, beer or other intoxicant on the prescription of a reputable prac-tising physician." A forfeit of one hundred dollars is to be paid by each party to the contract who shall violate any of its stipulations. This action followed immediately upon the  passage by the Winsboro city council of a stringent Sunday-enforcement ordi-nance, and the contract bears evidence of having been made with special reference to the provisions of that ordinance. So it is not to be supposed that the saloon-keepers are moved by any considerations in behalf of Sunday observance, or that they are at all zealous for the enforce-ment of the Sunday laws of the State, "according to the letter and the spirit thereof," or in any other manner. They doubtless consider that under the cir-cumstances their interests will be best advanced by an agreement of this sort. And in fact the interests of liquor deal-ers are not disturbed much by Sunday legislation after all. If they cannot set it at defiance they can profess to be its staunchest supporters, and can thus gain for themselves and their business in-creased "respectability." judging from the following, which emanates from Saratoga, Iowa, and is published in the Riceville (Iowa) Re-corder under the heading, "Resolutions," a Sunday-enforcement campaign is brew-ing in that community : Whereas: There has been and is in our vi-cinity constant and gross violation of law, both of the State and Bible, in buying and selling. (lancing, visiting, hunting, ball playing, and other games on Sunday, and profane talking in public, and Whereas: We desire to see our children grow tip righteous, taking that course in life, and to come into possession of character which will make them good citizens and fit them for heaven, and as we desire to work together with our legislative bodies and with God for the overthrow of evil and the establishment of righteousness; We recommend that several committees be formed, a committee to confer with the pro-prietor of each of our stores concerning the illegal selling of goods on Sunday, and a com-mittee to request and advise the pastors of the Bohemian, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Free
