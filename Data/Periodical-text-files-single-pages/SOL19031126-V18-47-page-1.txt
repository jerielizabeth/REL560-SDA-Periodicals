The Religion and Public Education Issue II PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR , Asen  t  4,,, n el  CHRISTIAN LIBERTY OF The  VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., NOVEMBER 26, 1903 NO. 47 . " If the public schools, because of being secular, are vicious, then must our whole theory of go'bernment, being secular, be vicious also." . It does not follow that because religious training for the children and youth is good for the welfare of society that religious training for the children and youth by the state is good for the welfare of society. The religionlPhich benefits the state is the religion which lebes and propagates itself without the aid of the state, and which aims at something much higher than the welfare of the state. That religion which seeks the aid and support of the state is not worth its aid and support. State supported and propagated religion is not the sort of religion that bene-fits society. If the fact that the inculcation of religious princi- ples is good for society affords ground for state support of the teaching of religion to boys and girls, it also affords ground for state support of the preaching of religion to boys and girls and men and women. If the state begins to sup- port religion it cannot logically stop with schools and the payment of teachers; itlPill have to go on to the maintenance of churches and the payment of preachers. If it supports public or denominational religious instruction, how can it refuse to support public or denominational worship? (A. PUBLICATION OFFICE : 222 NORTH CAPITOL STREET, WASHINGTON, D. C.
