Crimes are against man and sins are against God. A HUMAN prop to a divine institution is a slap in the face of the Almighty Š an avowal that God is not able to manage his own govern-ment. tV 1V IF the state is an individual, moral being with a national conscience and therefore ought to profess religion, who shall deny it the right to unite with the church/ And then who can say anything against a union of church and state I IV 1V 1.tf CHRIST never delegated authority to mortals to mete out judgments upon other mortals for refusing salvation or for nonconformity to re-ligious obligations. A man's conscience is to answer for itself before the divine tribunal at the last day. 114 s!E THE state by right can deal only with human affairs, that is, with man's duty to man. When-ever the state steps into the divine realm, it exceeds its prerogatives and introduces force into religion, which is contrary to the princi-ples of Christianity. 1V fir 1V A BILL has been introduced into the New Jersey Legislature to refer the question of Sun-day-law enforcement to the city municipalities or to the people on the referendum. The Lord's Day Alliance and ministerial associations are opposing the measure. They do not want public sentiment to determine this question. We say, Let the people rule. 114 IV 114 TAKE religion out of Sunday and it is no different from other days of the week. The prohibitions in a Sunday law are purely relig-ious prohibitions, and when the state enforces a Sunday law, it enforces religion pure and simple. For this reason all Sunday laws are wrong, because they penalize citizens for not conforming to religious notions.  THE Minneapolis Journal, in an editorial of January 22, commenting upon the expulsion of Socialists, in advance of a hearing, by the Assembly of the State of New York, makes the following pertinent comments: " The whole is-sue involves the right of majorities in a repub-lic. No majority, for example, can enforce or impose on even a few, their religious opinions. And it has been found altogether inexpedient for such a majority to enforce a specific keep-ing of the Sabbath. It must be proved beyond question that an individual is doing injury to society before the majority is warranted in branding him a criminal. There should be no danger today that hasty majorities may com-promise the liberty that has made popular gov-ernment possible. Mr. Hughes shows insight and courage in pointing out the limitations of majority rule. To overlook these limitations is only to give the satisfaction of martyrdom to our obstreperous minorities." !V ttf 1V A SUNDAY law is in itself an open acknowl-edgment that it is religious and not civil. Everything that is uncivil in the conduct and relationship of man with man, is fully covered by civil statutes that are applicable for twenty-four hours on each day of each week in the year. The fact that a special law is called for to regulate human conduct on Sunday, is good evidence that these additional prohibitions are religious and not civil. A Sunday law is an infringement upon " the equal and impartial civil laws of the state," and make certain acts crime only one day in the week. ttE 1V !V A BILL has been introduced into the legisla-ture at Annapolis to liberalize the Sunday law of Maryland. The Lord's Day Alliance and the preachers are opposed to any modification of the law of 1723. The church proposes to fight every inch of the ground as she is forced to retreat from the field of politics. 114 tV THE life, the peace, and the prosperity of the republic lies in the separation of church and state. Ecclesiasticism, whether Roman, Greek, Protestant, Jewish, or Mohammedan, must be rebuked whenever it attempts to secure legal recognition of its tenets or seeks carnal power through civil authority. Church and state must he kept separate. 41,
