AN INDICTMENT OF NEW YORK'S SUNDAY LAW  811 legal right and common justice to the worst of criminals as well as those of inferior grade of turpitude. But the statute under review in no instance grants to the accused all the rights and privileges which the constitution se-cures to him and the laws in other cases allow to others who commit crimes or misdemeanors. And the first enact-ing clause withholds from him, merely because he is seen to work or play on Sunday, all of those rights and privi-leges which are allowed to murderers and felons and to those who commit any public crimes or misdemeanors, or even private wrongs. By the enacting clause first men-tioned, the very meanest grade of judi-cial officer, upon his own view, that is, on himself seeing a citizen laboring on Sunday for his own or the subsistence of his offspring, or perchance resting from his toil and taking recreation, is empowered and enjoined by the law in question, immediately, without any in-vestigation, or any charge of crime on oath; without any "presentment or in-dictment of a grand jury" ;without time or opportunity to employ and advise with counsel in his case ; without the time or privilege of procuring process to compel the attendance of witnesses ; without time to prepare for trial, or opportunity to prove his innocence ; without the right to examine the jus-tice, the only witness, or even any wit-ness on his own or the adverse side, and of course without the chance to prove the ignorance or weakness of the jus-tice, the malignity of his motives, or the honest error of his opinion, his testi-mony, or his judgment, and even with-out the right to appeal from his deci-sion to show its error or to seek redress for the violation of every principle of constitutional and legal right and jus-'tice by which he has been deprived of his liberty without the judgment of his  peers or the "due process of law" to which others are entitled who commit the worst criminal offenses√ëand all this unjust and disgraceful proceeding is allowed, justified, nay enjoined, by the statute which has occasioned these remarks ! Reader, look at it again. A justice of the peace, on seeing a person at work on Sunday, as if omniscient and omnipotent, immediately judges his work to be neither necessary nor char-itable, and that his religious creed is not orthodox according to the statute in such case made and provided, and, whether influenced by superstition, bigotry, malignity, honest error, or by the law in question, forthwith seizes on his victim, and instantly issues his warrant in nature of lettre de cachet and "deprives him of his liberty," im-prisons, disgraces and punishes him, without even the shadow of a trial or a chance to defend himself ! And for what ? Reader, hear for what. Merely because he, as most professed Chris-tians do, disbelieves in the moral obli-gation to keep the Jewish sabbath, and because he, with the Jews and a part of the Christian sect, disbelieves in the moral obligation to keep Sunday as a sabbath day; or because, contrary to the statute, he disbelieves in the moral obligation to keep either of those two, or any particular day more than another, as holy time ! Yes, this is the reason, and the only reason, why the victim of this unrighteous law is with-out any of the rights or privileges se-cured to other persons charged with public crime, and without a chance to make defense or the semblance of a trial for his supposed offense, deprived of his liberty, and that, too, without the right of appeal in any way to show the iniquity or honest error of the judg-ment of this supreme court of con-science ! Such is the cause for this out-
