THE _AMERICAN SENTINEL. 199 "KNOWLEDGE.' NEW WEEKLY 11TAGAZINE. Knowlbdgei a new weekly magazine, occupies a new field, and if it accomplishes what it under-takes, it might tObe4ntlispentfable, to, every oWher of a Cyclopedia. It proposes to answer the almOst infinite slumber of questions upon which one or-dinarily consults a Cyclopedia, and fails to find the answer, generally becauSe the Cyclopedia is not " up to date "-it was published, ' probably, five years ago, or, mayhap, ten or more years ago. "The world moves," and the most important questions that want answers are of to-day, not of yeaterday. For instance, Caprivi succeeds Bis-marck,a$,Chancellor Of Germany; who is Caprivi? How do you pronounce his name ? A terrible storm at Apia. Where is that ? How do you pro-nounce it ? A revolution in Brazil a few weeks ago. What is the new status? And so on. If you consult any Cyclopedia, and fail to find the answer to your question, or you find authorities differing, send a postal-card to Knowledge, and find your answer m the neat Week's issue. The magazine is published in handsome and handy form, and a complete index is Promised twice a year, with bound volumes at nominal price to its subscribers. ' A specimen copy of the magazine will be sent free to any aPplicant. Ł The price, like all the issues of this publisher, is hardly more than nominalL-$1.00 a year. JOHN B.
