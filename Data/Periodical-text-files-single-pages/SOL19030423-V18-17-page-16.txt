"Rome is aiming to reestablish her power, to recover her lost supremacy. She is silently growing into power. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her." READ THESE QUOTATIONS In the name of Leo XIII., I salute the great American Republic. . . . To-day this is the duty of the Catholics: To bring into the world the fullness of supernatural truth and super-natural life. . . . There are the nations who have never separated from the Church, but who have neglected often to apply in full degree the lessons of the gospel. THERE ARE THE NATIONS WHO HAVE GONE OUT FROM THE CHURCH, bringing with them many of her treasures, and because of what they have brought, shedding partial light. BUT CUT OFF FROM THE SOURCE, UNLESS THAT SOURCE IS AGAIN BROUGHT INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH THEM, THERE IS DANGER FOR THE FUTURE. . . . Bring your fellow-countrymen, BRING YOUR COUNTRY INTO IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THAT GREAT SECRET OF BLESSEDNESSŠChrist and His CHURCH. . . . HERE IN AMERICA DO WE HAVE, more than elsewhere, THE KEY TO THE FUTURE. . . . Here you have a country WHICH WILL REPAY ALL EFFORTS, not merely tenfold, BUT AYE A HUNDREDFOLD.

Thus spoke the wonder-ful old man who is to-day celebrating his jubilee. He was speaking to Archbishop Farley, then a bishop, making a visit to the Vatican. "In the United States," the Pontiff continued, "the Church enjoys liberty. There she is allowed to build her churches and schools un-molested. Here-in Rome, I, Vicar of Christ, am a slave, deprived of free action. In Italy, in France, the Church is being persecuted by those who should defend her. THANK GOD FOR THE CONSOLATION THAT COMES FROM FREE AMERICA!" . . . From the day when he began his long reign in the Vatican, AMERICA AND AMERICANS have re-ceived a large part of the thought bestowed by this wise and far-sighted Pope upon the millions of the faithful committed to his charge. AMERICANS, NOT ONLY THE CLERGY AND LAITY OF THE CHURCH, BUT PROTESTANTS AS WELL, have been welcome at the Vatican, and have been eagerly questioned by the pallid, withered old man, whose glowing eyes seemed to read the answers to his keen questions before they were spoken. He has always dismissed them with a few words which sent them back to their. country full of con-fidence in his love for the freest and most enlightened of his people. To Bishop McDonnell, of Brooklyn, he said: "I am rejoiced at the continued manifestations of the fidelity of American Catholics AND AT THE PROGRESS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN AMERICA, I now consider THE AMERICAN PEOPLE the BEST CHILDREN OF THE CHURCH."ŠJames Montague in New York Journal, February 21, 1903. And then read, and get others to read, from beginning to end the new series of articles by ALONZO T. JONES on The Supremacy of the Papacy now being printed in THE SENTINEL, and which began with the issue of March 19. "Men are closing their eyes to the real character of Romanism, and the dan-gers to be apprehended from her supremacy. The people need to be aroused to resist the advances of this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty."
