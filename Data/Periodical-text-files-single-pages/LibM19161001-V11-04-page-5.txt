ABRAHAM LINCOLN LIBERTY "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Leo. 25 : 10. VOI.. XI FOURTH QUARTER, 1916 No. 6             Lincoln Home Preserved by a Grateful Nation Notable Eulogies for the Preserver of Liberty BY THE THE Lincoln cabin, in Hodgenville, Ky., now housed in a magnificent me- morial structure, has been presented to the American people by the Lincoln Farm Association, together with the Lincoln homestead. President Wilson, in be-half of the United States, accepted this gift at the memorial dedicatory cere-monies held September 4. This little cabin, suffering the vicissitudes of decay and neglect for nearly a century, but now preserved as a national memorial, is another shrine to liberty which will be visited by millions, and held in grate-ful memory by freemen as long as the Republic shall Some notable addresses were made on this occasion. Former Gov. Joseph W. Folk of Missouri, president of the Lin-coln Farm Association, the first speaker at the ceremonies, paid Mr. Lincoln's memory this glowing tribute : Š EDITOR " This country has produced many mer. whose names have emblazoned the pages of history, but no name is dearer than that of the simple and sublime Lincoln, who literally sprang from this soil to become the mightiest of the mighty. His birthplace was as lowly as that of the Man of Galilee, whom he re-sembled so much in the sor-rows he knew, the burdens he bore, and the love of humanity he manifested. This crude cabin, preserved in this mag-nificent marble mausoleum, is consecrated by the life of the man who here came into the world. No poet's fancy, no dream of fiction, can equal the emerging from this humble hut of extreme poverty of one whose steps were destined to shake the world, and whose mission was to rededicate a united nation to the cause of freedom." address was delivered by Pres. Woodrow Wilson, and was a mas-terpiece in English literature, in logic, in patriotism, in statesmanship, and in en- comium. We can here give only a few striking paragraphs from this notable address. Standing in front of the cabin endure. The final " With firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right,"Š the man who said this, it is generally conceded, was a fairly good American. 179
