Inasmuch as men have performed a variety of Sunday labor in this city for years without being molested, going as far at times as sawing wood in the front yard while people were going by to church, Mr. Rogers' conscience feels better than his sense of justice. This smacks finely of old colonial days when every man's hand was religiously against his neighbor who differed from him in precept or practice. ON Sunday evening, May 22, after a sermon in Primghar, Iowa, the congregation was asked to vote upon closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and excluding intoxicating liquor from the grounds. With this temperance clause the vote received quite a strong indorsement from the congregation. An editor in the place, not feeling satisfied with the result, canvassed the town the next day to find out how many were in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday,Šleaving out the consideration of the temperance clause,Šand out of those whom he canvassed he found fourteen in favor of closing on Sunday, and sixty-three against it. If the managers of the Fair desire to close the great Exposition on that day, it is certainly their right and privilege to do so; but if those in the churches who are laboring to this end would not resort to such strategies to secure votes in its favor, they could have the satisfaction of dealing fairly, even if the Exposition should not be closed. A REPORTER for the Chicago Tribune quotes Dr. W. W. Atterbury, of this city, as saying in an in- terview :Š At the Paris Exposition one of the most impor-tant and notable congresses held was that devoted to " Sunday rest." President Harrison was chosen honorary president of the congress, but sent a letter of regret, and M. Leon Say was made chairman. The question was discussed apart from its religious aspect, and upon hygienic, social, and industrial considerations. The congress was well attended by representatives of railroad and manufacturing com-panies, chambers of commerce, working men's societies, and by others interested in social and political economyŠRoman Catholics, Protestants, Israelites, and Freethinkers. The results of the congress were very appreciable. A French popular league for the promotion of Sunday rest was organ-ized, with M. Jules Simon as honorary president, and M. Leon Say acting president, which has been instrumental in spreading the idea of Sunday rest throughout France. A congress similar to this will be held at the World's Fair in Chicago, and it is certain to bring together a company of illustrious men from all branches of society in every part of the world. It will certainly be one of the most notable con-gresses held, and most surely will be productive of great benefit to the cause of Sunday observance everywhere. The reporter then says Of the Doctor himself :Š Dr. Atterbury has been for many years the Sec-retary of the New York Sabbath Committee, and is familiar with the Sunday-rest movement in Europe. For this reason he has been placed in chargt of the arrangements for the International Sunday-rest Congress to be held in 1893. President C. C. Bon-ney, of the World's Fair Auxiliaries, thinks the . congress of so much importance that he is soon to issue an address concerning it, for distribution in foreign lands. An open Fair will give an excellent opportunity to preach Sunday closing to many thousands who otherwise would not be likely to be their listeners. It is strange this was not thought of earlier, and Congress petitioned to compel all to attend church at the Fair on Sunday. "The Prohibition Party and Freedom of Conscience" No. 49 of the " Sentinel Library," is just the thing to circulate during the political campaign. It sets forth clearly the proper sphere of civil gov-ernment, and can not fail to fix the attention of Ł candid, thinking people. Eight pages ; price, one cent; usual discount in large quantities.
