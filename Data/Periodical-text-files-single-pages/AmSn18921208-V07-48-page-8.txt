384 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. Vol. 7, No. 48 NEW YORK, DECEMBER 8, 1892. NOTE.Š Any one receiving THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked " Sample copy." It is our invari-able rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore; those who have not ordered THE SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office. Six of the Seventh-day Adventists in-dicted some weeks since in Henry County, Tenn., for quiet Sunday work, have been arrested and placed under bonds to ap-pear for trial early in February, 1893. Other arrests are to follow, if they have not been already made. Š0Š THESE men will doubtless be convicted. They are all members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and as it is already in evidence in the trials held last May that it is the habit of members of that church to work on Sunday, it is a foregone con-clusion that all the accused are guilty of Sunday work. ALL these men work on Sunday because they feel that it would be wrong to do otherwise. They acknowledge only one Sabbath, namely, the seventh day, and they can not conscientiously observe an-other day by abstaining from worldly labor and business as the law of Tennes-see requires. They believe that the fourth commandment not only requires them to abstain from worldly pursuits on the seventh day, but that it requires them to regard and treat all other days alike, to db on the other six days whatever work or business they have to do. And in this they are not peculiar. In the Mail and Express of November 29, 1892, the editor, who is also president of the American Sab-bath Union, says The fourth commandment covers not merely the Sabbath day, not merely the one-seventh contin-uous part of time, but it also covers the other six days in the week. It imparts two obligations upon mankind. The one is to work six days in the week. The other is to rest the seventh. This is true, not because Mr. Shepard says it, but because it is in accord with the word of God. Some months since the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, the organ of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination, argued this matter thus':Š The language of the commandment imparts something more than a mere permission to labor upon six days of the week. It imparts something in the nature of an obligation. The propriety of its doing so can be readily seen. Six days of the week are left to be devoted to man and his temporal interests, but the seventh day is the Lord's,Šthe day upon which he rested, and which he blessed and sanctified. This day must therefore be kept distinct and separate from all other days, and Ł of course the means for doing this must not be likewise employed in behalf of other days, or the distinction would be lost. If  mankind should regularly refrain from work upon two days of the weekŠthe seventh day and some other dayŠin the manner prescribed by the com-mandment for the seventh day, there would be nothing in it to show which day it was that God rested upon, and which he sanctified and blessed, Šnothing to signify that God created the heavens and the earth in six days, and rested upon the seventh,Šand thus the purpose of the institution would entirely fail. The observance of the com-mandment by rest upon the seventh day would be nullified by the like rest upon the other day. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the six work- - hag days should be kept distinct in character from that day which God has set apart for himself. Š0Š Tins being the view entertained by Adventists, it follows that to obey any Sunday law that forbids them to follow their secular vocations on Sunday, is at the same time to violate their consciences. And in requiring them to do this under penalty, the State of Tennessee abridges their liberty, and violates the Constitution of that State which declares that " no hu-man authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of con-science." Š0Š THE Sun, of this city, remarks that " President Higginbotham's action in be-half of the directors of the Columbian Fair, asking that the act of Congress re-quiring the gates to be closed on Sunday be reconsidered and reversed, ought to effect that result." Š0Š IN his plea for an open Fair, President Higginbotham says that " a large major-ity of the people of the United States are in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday." The Sun declares its belief that " a very large proportion, perhaps a majority, of the people who are regular church-goers are in favor of having the Fair open, be-cause it will afford a better place to pass the time than would otherwise be chosen by the great body of visitors." " BuT the strongest argument," says the Sun, "and one which ought to be de-cisive, is that Sunday is the only day which tens of thousands who ought to see the Fair can command for that purpose. If they can not visit it on Sunday they will not visit it at all, or at best they will see comparatively little of it. If the Fair is not for them it might almost as well not be held." Š0Š THIS plea for the workingman has been pooh-poohed by the advocates of rigid Sunday closing, but it is certainly worthy of consideration. No one can see the entire Fair in a single day. It follows that if the average workingman must de-duct both the time and the money neces-sary to see the Fair from his already too scant wages, or else forego the privilege, thousands will be compelled to do the lat-ter. This does not prove, however, that the Fair should be opened on Sunday; it simply shows that Congress in deciding for a closed Fair ignored the working- men in order that a sop might be thrown to the churches. Š0Š As we have said before, an open Pair is not compatible with Sabbath-keeping. Those who regard Sunday as the Sabbath, could not, in the very nature of the case, consistently attend the Fair on that day. But that is no reason why they should in-sist that the tens of thousands who regard Sunday only as a holiday should not be permitted to visit the Fair, provided those who have the management of it and who are responsible for it, are willing that they should do so. The evil of this Sun-day-closing movement is, that it has by threats of political boycott induced Con-' gress to do something that it had no right to do, and to take sides in a religious con-troversy, something which the framers of the Federal Constitution designed to for-ever prohibit. Š0Š IT is stated that the ministers of Port Jervis, this State, irrespective of creed, have combined with the undertakers and signed an agreement to discontinue the holding of Sunday funerals hereafter. They say that they shall decline to attend any such services except in cases of abso-lute necessity. The agreement is signed by ten ministers, Protestant and Catholic, and two undertaking firms, and was read yesterday from the various pulpits. Sun-day funerals had become so prevalent that the clergy resolved to break up the cus-tom, and thereby lessen their labors on that day. This shows the amount of re-gard the ministers have for " the poor work-ing-man," for by this action many wage-workers will be compelled to take choice between a day's wages and the privilege of paying the last sad tribute of respect to departed friends, and when burying their dead, many sorrowing families will be denied the satisfaction of the presence and manifest sympathy of a large num-ber of neighbors and friends. Many of the ministers are becoming as lazy, wicked and heartless, as were the popish. priests just before the Reformation. -0-- ON the last day before its recent ad-journment, the Vermont Legislature by a vote of ninety-nine to sixty-seven rejected a resolution indorsing the action of Con-gress in closing the World's Fair on Sun-day. This action is the more significant in view of the fact that two years ago the Legislature of that State passed a resolu-tion requesting the closing of the Fair. Other indications are not lacking to show that if public sentiment ever was in favor of Sunday closing, it is rapidly changing. THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, A.
