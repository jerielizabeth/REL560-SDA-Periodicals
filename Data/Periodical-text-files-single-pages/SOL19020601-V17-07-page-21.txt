EDITORIAL 415 fellnallaall CONSSTOAN Lamm' Set for the defense of human rights from the standpoint of Christianity. The only periodical in the United States wholly devoted to exposing and oppos-ing the increasing movements and tendencies of the present time which either directly aim at or logically tend to the employment of the power of law in the domain of conscience, in subversion of the Christian and American principle of complete separation of church and state.

(See close of reading matter for terms of subscription, etc.) DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ. We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society. We believe in supporting civil govern-ment, and submitting to its authority.

A trend toward "stronger govern-ment" in the state usually attends and signifies a trend toward weaker govern-ment in the individuals composing the state. ≈Å The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. It is only through the power of the life of the perfectly self-governed, principle-governed Man, Christ Jesus, that the members of the race of which He became one, can attain to perfect self-government. Without freedom of the individual conscience there can be no such thing as a public or collective conscience. They who in their devotion to the "collective conscience" disregard the rights of the individual conscience are undermining the foundations of the structure which they are attempting to erect. The great optimists of the world are they whose lives and words have been such that they have left to all succeeding ages the inestimable legacy of inspiration to righteousness, truth, and justice. And with few exceptions these have been they
