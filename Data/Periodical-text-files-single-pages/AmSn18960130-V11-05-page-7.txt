This is a work of 160 large octavo pages, telling in simple but touching and forc-ible language the "Old, old story of Jesus and his love." It is profusely illustrated, containing 78 beautiful and appropriate engravings. The preface, written by G. C. Tenney, author of " By Land and Sea Through Five Continents," more nearly does justice to this work than anything we can say :Š " The story of the earthly life of Christ our Saviour is written without words in ten thou-sand forms on every feature of nature, in every phase of human experience, in every fact of life. We never can fully realize how deep is the impression, how widespread is the influ-ence of the life of Jesus of Nazareth. Every blessing of every kind comes to us through that connection between heaven and earth which was formed when-the Lord of glory es-poused the cause of a world lost in sin. " The infinite pathos of that story has in-spired the pen of the learned and the tongue of the eloquent. But it is best told in child-like language. The wonderful spectacle needs no human coloring. Its glory surpasses the art of men. It shines brightest in its own luster. " In these pages no effort is made toward artificial embellishment. The plain story is simply told by a pen that is moved with a deep sense of the infinite proportions of the subject. The pen is controlled by a reverence for the sacred theme that preserves it un-marred by human suggestions, thus forming an appropriate sequel to the angelic announce-mentŠ' Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to men.' " We are wont to sing in the familiar songŠ " Tell me the story simply, as to a little child.' "The author has done this. May it be received in the same simplicity and purity of faith."
