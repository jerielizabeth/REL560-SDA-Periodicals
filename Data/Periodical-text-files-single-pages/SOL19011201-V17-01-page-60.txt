Dear Sir: Please send to my address one Simplicity Vaporizer. My neighbor was suffering greatly with his throat, head and lungs, and I took my Vaporizer over for him to try, and it gave him so much relief that he felt he could not give it up, so I let him keep it. But I must have another. WK. HANDLEY, Weir, Ills. THE Simplicity Vaporizer converts fluids into a vapor so light that it floats in the air. This medicated vapor fills every crevice of the nasal cavity and lungs, leaving after a few min-utes' application a coating of the healing fluids con-tained in the Vaporizer as effectually as if it had been applied with a brush. Thus the germs are destroyed and the disease cured. Recommended by all Leading Physicians, Price, with medicine, postpaid, - - - $1.50. AGENTS WANTED.
