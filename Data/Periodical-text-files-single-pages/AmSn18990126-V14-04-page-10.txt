 58 AMERICAN SENTINEL.        by night and a cloud by day to the downtrodden and oppressed all over the world. In the light of this sen-tence crowns have fallen to the dust and men have stood anew in their own manhood. In the light of this sen-tence Simon Bolivar, the liberator of South America, laid in blood and carnage the foundation stones of the South American republics. In the light of this sentence Kosciusko led his Spartan bands against the hosts of Ru Sian and Austrian oppressors of his native Poland. This burning sentence attracted the attention of Lafayette, across the water, and his ships set sail for our relief. In the light of this sentence Garibaldi struck down Bourbon tyranny and carved his name not only in the hearts of lovers of liberty in Italy, but all over the world. No, Mr. President, we will not amend that sentence now. We will not insert the word "some" just yet. It has passed beyond the power of this country to amend the Declaration of Independence. We are told by others that we must govern the Philippine Islands or abandon them and turn them back to Spain. Have we got to govern or abandon Cuba? Is that an honest excuse for grabbing something in viola- ' tion of the common, honest law of nations ? Let me tell you what our good friend Fox said in the English Parliament, that some of you expansionists read when you were boys and have long since forgotten. I quote his exact language, from the volume of Fox's speeches:Š "The noble lord who moved the amendment said that we were in the dilemma of conquering or abandon-ing America. What have been the advantages of Amer-ica to this kingdom ? Extent of trade, increase of commercial advantages, and a numerous people grow-ing up in the same ideas and sentiments as ourselves. Now, sir, would those advantages accrue to us if Amer-ica was conquered ? Not one of them." Let me read just a little further from what Fox said in answer to this proposition, made so far by all the people who are in favor of taking the Philippine. Islands, whether the people of those islands want us to do so or not. Fox, following on in the same speech on the same day, in reply to the Crown, said:Š "Such a possession of America must be secured by a standing armyŠ" Is not that true here? "and that, let me observe, must be a very considerable army." Is not that true here? Aguinaldo has 50,000 men a'id one climate. Mr. Fox, continuing, said:Š "Consider, sir, that that army must be cut off from the intercourse of social liberty here, and accustomed in every instance to bow down and break the spirits of men, to trample on the rights and live on the spoils cruelly wrung from the sweat and labor of their fellow-subjects. Such an army employed for such purposes, and paid by such means, for supporting such principles, would be a very proper instrument to effect points of a greater, or at least more favorite importance nearer home; points, perhaps, very unfavorable to the libertieS of this coun-try." Not one expansionist: not one who advocates the taking of these islands against the consent of the peo-ple, but what will tell you in the same breath, "Yes, it is going to be a great tax upon the people of the United States, but we will let the Filipinos pay that tax." They are to pay for our standing army. They are to pay the price of their own chains. Mr. President, suppose England had accepted that advice of Fox, the great lover of liberty. They said he was America's friend. Ah, but in the light of history he was a better friend to England. If England had accepted that advice and made us their friend, the hundred years last passed would have shown a different state of affairs between England and the United States of America. Tell me why we should adopt one plan for Cuba and another for the Philippines. Do you say, with the ex-plosionistsŠI mean the expansionistsŠ"We promised we would not steal Cuba, but we did not promise not to steal the Philippines?" Do you say, with Shylock, "It is so nominated in the bond?" You remember Jack in the Two Orphans was charged with stealing a coat. He said, "You lie; it was a cloak." Will you tell me, please, how grand larceny and criminal aggression in Cuba be-come high Christian civilization in the Philippines? Is there some place in the Pacific Ocean where we change the code of ethics and good morals as we change the cal-endar and the ship's clock in crossing? Mr. President, we can not teach them to govern themselves. There is only one road to self-government. That is through the gate of responsibility, along the rough and rugged road of experience. You can't teach liberty and self-government with a Mauser gun. Spain has tried it for centuries; at least, with guns similar if not of the same pattern. For centuries she has been for expansion, more land, more property, more poor people she could ride over with some cheap politician with a crown on his head. Are we going to keep the crown room there that Spain occupied? Is the throne room to be kept intact for Tammany Hall or the Republican party, when we send our envoys there? Spain is an expansionist and has been for centuries. And say, my friends, have you forgotten the first rule proved by all history, without exception, that every square inch of territory taken by force has to be held by force? Go to your children, who are in the first year of the high school, and they will tell you the rule, that in all history every square\  foot of ground taken by force from an alien nation has to be kept by force. But distinguished gentlemen who claim a monopoly of patriotism, who do not seem to observe the difference between expansion and explosion, say that we who be-lieve in getting the consent of the governed before we govern them want to give back the Philippines to Spain. Everyone who makes the statement knows that is not what we want. May I repeat the old story of Lincoln?
