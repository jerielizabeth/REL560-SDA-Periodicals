THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 311 " The Sabbath is our safeguard. It is our break-water. These people are mostly foreigners, and they are trying to establish foreign customs in our land. Americans are known the world over as a Sabbath-observing people. It is on account of their loyalty to the Master that Americans have been so prosperous. We have no wars. Plagues never visit our shores. God has blessed us, and we should not allow foreign Sabbath-breaking customs to obtain a foothold here. " I am surprised that the ministers of Greenville have not publicly protested from their pulpits. I am surprised that our church members have not made a united protest. The Turners have no ex-cuse whatever for opening the fair on the Sabbath day. They are undermining the fundamental principle of Christianity. Can we, as Christians, conscientiously stand by and allow such things to take place? Not By all means, not" What can Mr. Chapman and the Christians to whom he appeals conscientiously do in such a mat-ter? No doubt Mr. Chapman thinks they can appeal to law and compulsion, and so enforce upon the Germans of Jersey City the identical cus-toms of Sunday observance which they themselves follow. But can they do that and remain expo-nents of the Christianity which Christ taught? They can not. They know they can not. Mr. Chap-man knows they can not. Then why does he not stop and think, before making such statements? BISHOP PATTERSON, the Martyr of MelanesiaŠBy Jesse Page. 12mo, 160 pages, fully illustrated, cloth extra, 75 cents.
