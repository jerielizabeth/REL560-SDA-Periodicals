LIBERTY 47 for hod, for humanity, and for country, fight, and fight today, to drive this enemy from our land. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and save little children from a degenerate birth. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and pre-serve the health of thousands of men whom alcohol is degrading. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and save a hundred thousand of our citizens an-nually from an untimely death. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and stay its red hand of murder. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and par-alyze its black hand of rapine. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and res-cue thousands of little children from be- ing crushed beneath its black-horsed char-iot of slaughter. Destroy the liquor traffic now, and pre-serve in purity and honor the moral char-acter of multitudes for whom the Saviour died. The home, the state, the individual, business, the industrial world, the social world, the medical world, and the general welfare demand the immediate destruc-tion of the liquor traffic. Heal the hurt of John Barleycorn's liv-ing victims, then refuse to drink his poi-son, decline to visit his haunts of vice. and by your vote outlaw him from your State and nation. Do it now, delay is dangerous.Å  The American Issue, Oct. 23, 1915. HARD WORK KEEPING AFLOAT
