VOL. i OCTOBER, 1906 No. 3 Survey of the Field SINCE the last issue of LIBERTY there have been developments of interest and im-portance in the world-wide problem of relig-ious freedom. In some countries the de-mand for religious legislation seems to be growing more urgent. There have also been acts outside of leg-islation which indicate a drift away from the true principles of religious liberty. Brazil furnishes an object-lesson in this line. Hungary furnishes another, in her attitude of intolerance toward Protestant meetings in spite of her law guaranteeing religious liberty. China's attitude toward the Sunday institution has been a matter of no little surprise even to the staunchest advocates of a union of religion and the state. Cuba is taking her stand for a stricter enforcement of Sunday observance; and Canada is looking forward to the time when her new Sunday law shall become operative. The English Education bill so strongly favored by the Commons, so strongly opposed by the established church and the Catholic Church, and now emas-culated by the House of Lords, is the cen-ter of the most earnest controversy at the present time. At the same time there is a growing sentiment throughout England in behalf of stricter Sunday laws. France has maintained her position upon the separation of church and state; Spain is following her example in some degree ; and even Italy is showing signs of a growing antagonism toward church dictation in tem-poral affairs. Russia just now is giving  promise of true religious liberty to all within the realm. Thus while countries in which church and state have been most closely united are swinging away from that condition, other countries of greater en-lightenment are swinging back, in prin-ciple and practise, to the conditions from which their neighbors are struggling to get free. Brazil.Å  It will be remembered that when the people of Brazil set up a govern-ment of themselves, by themselves, there was instituted a separation of church and state. There was lay neutrality in the schools, civil marriages and civil burials were made legal. On the same principle the crucifix was removed from the courts of justice. Now a reaction is setting in, and large bodies of Catholics have been demanding the restoration of the crucifixes in the courts. Recently, in Rio de Janeiro, a procession of about ten thousand persons marched from the cathedral, to the music of two military bands, through the princi-pal streets to re-establish the old order of things so far as the courts are concerned. The central figure of the procession was the parish priest, walking under a rich canopy, the cords of which were held by six magis-trates and officers. The priest carried the crucifix. At the end of the procession came a bevy of twenty-one young girls, decked with ribbons of the national colors,. representing the twenty-one Brazilian States. The priest }-earing the crucifix
