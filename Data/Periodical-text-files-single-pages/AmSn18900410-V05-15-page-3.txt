We are glad, to present in this number a corrobora-tion of our views by a minister of the gos-pel. ,AndŁ we are the more "glad because the argument which we shall quote was made' in Ła Sunday convention, in the sec- ond annual, meeting of the Sabbath Asso-ciation of Iowa, which was held in Des Moines, November 12 and 13,,1889. Rev. J. IC, Fowler, . of Cedar Rapids, gave an address, on ‚,` The, Basis of the Civil Sab-hath,", which was printed in full in the lowo,Stcqe Register, of November 13, from which we. quote. Speaking of the laws already existing, and of the Sunday laws which the association is seeking to make, he said , If these laWs are ;right, why are they right f There ;needs ._to. be a;  clearing up on this point. The ideas (4 many are Łvague and faulty as to the genius and intent of these Sunday regulations. Many in the Church and out imagine that they prescribe a precept of the Christian religion ; that they are simply a transcript of the fourth commandment to our statute-books. More than that, many ardent defenders of the Sabbath, justify them on that ground. They say, God ha's enjoilled the observance of the Sabbath, .and the—State should do the, same. But God has demanded, that we be good stewards of his bounty, and give liberally to him. Is the State therefore to command this ? God has commanded that we be given to hospitality. Is the State to see to it that this be accomplished? God has com-manded that we honor one another and 'in honor prefer) One another. Shall the State undertake the enforcement of these,  divine laws ? It is time we had done arguing for Sabbath legislation before Congress or other legislative bodies on plea of its divine institution and scriptural authority. It is utterly untenable according to the spirit of our charters of government. In this paragraph the question is fairly stated, arid the statement in the closing sentence is correct. After referring 'to certain judicial deciSions on certain laws against crime, the speaker continued as follows :-- The civil law forbids these, not as offenses against God, but as Crimes against man: The law has to do with the relations of men to each other, and not with the relations of men to God. To base  these Sunday laws thus upon a divine command, as the civil giound, is to that extent to join Church and State, and to violate the fundamental principles of the State and federal governments. In the above paragraph we have a just distinction made between sin and crime. Sin is the violation of the moral law. Crime is a violation of human law. We wish the reader to notice the latter part of the paragraph just quoted. In agreement with arguments we have before presented, he shows that for the State to base its law upon divine command, or to attempt to en- force any one of the divine commands, is the union of Church and State. This was wholesome truth to present before a Sun-day convention. We wish every Sunday convention could listen to similar talk. Mr. Fowler continued as follows, concern- ing the idea that the State could enact a Siinday law on the basis of the divine com- mandment :Š But such a basis of the Sunday law is not only illegal, but it may be even unscriptural. The Bible itself does not warrant us, in inscribing upon the civil statute-books whatever we find to be the mind of the Lord. The Bible does give us a divine stand-ard of moral duty, by which we may discriminate be-tween right and wrong. But it also gives a divine model of wise legislation. It shows there are some things reasonable and some unreasonable to under-take by the civil statute, that statutory law is not to be framed always into exact correspondence with the criterion of individual duty. And this scriptural lesson is one of the very first importance for a Christian citizen of a republic like ours to learn. We wish every citizen of this republic might learn this scriptural lesson. The fact that the great body of the National Reformers desire to have the State attempt `to re-enact and enforce the law of God, shows, according to Rev. Mr. Fowler, of Cedar Rapids, that they are very deficient in scriptural knowledge; and in this we agree with him. Again Mr. Fowler said :Š If our zealous, well-meaning, but deluded friends of the Sabbath, desire to defeat the very ends they aim at, they want to push to the front, and press upon the law makers this scriptural command for the basis of Sunday laws, until a furor of public feeling like that of 1826 again sweeps the country and takes with it every vestige of Sabbath legislation. Many good people, even in these boasted days of religious liberty, fail to' understand that the State is not com-petent to enact divine precepts because they are di-vine. The law against murder is not on the civil statute-books because it is in the deealogue, but be-cause society could not exist without such a law. The law against stealing is not in the civil code because it was found essential to maintain the rights of property. Government exists to secure to men life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, to main-tain a peaceful and orderly, a mutual, helpful condi-tion of society. Hence its laws simply aim at these ends. They are passed because of some supposed public need, because it is believed the general good requires them. We are bound thus in the matter of the Sunday laws to stand outside of the Bible and argue for them on the same line as all the other laws, because the public need and advantage require them. If we cannot indicate them on these grounds, then they can claim and deserVe no place on the statute-books. ŁWith this also we heartily agree ; only one statement might have been made a little stronger, and that is, that laws passed to secure men life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, are passed on account of some,  supposed public need. There can be no supposition about it. If there is to be any public at all, it is an actual necessity that life and liberty be preserved. But in all these.  paragraphs which we have quoted the speaker has shown a clear perception of the limitations of human government, and we would that all could read his argu-ment and see the force of it, and agree with him that, if Sunday laws are made to stand, it must be because the public good requires them. The next and closing paragraph of this speech shows how im-possible it is to make it appear that the public good requires a Sunday law, and that the Sunday should be enforced for the same reason that laws are enacted against stealing. Said he :Š That a law-guarded rest-day is one of these agen-cies will hardly be questioned by any reasonable man. On that day peace of God settles down over Sabbath-keeping land. The din of labor ceases, and the din of strife and merry-making, and a few quiet hours are given in which the most engrossed and toil-burdened soul may at least have the opportunity, if it will, to worship God and learn of truths that bear upon a right life. Remember that the law makes no attempt to enforce religion, or even relig-ious observance, on Sunday. It simply institutes a weekly civil holiday, and surrounds it with safe-guards such as subserve the interests of morality and make as favorable as possible. In this last paragraph the speaker went against all he had so clearly stated before. His attempt to show that society requires such a law, by stating that on Sunday, if enforced by law, peace settles down over the land, and a few quiet hours are given in which all may have the opportunity to learn of God and truths that bear upon a right life, shows that such laws are at least an attempt to enforce morality. There is not the slightest ground on which a so-called civil Sunday law can be based consistently with justice. If it is said that man needs one day in seven for rest, then we will point to the thousands who are observing the seventh day of the week, and to the scores of thousands who are observing the first day of the week, without any law compelling rest. That is sufficient evidence.  that no such law is needed. If the law is asked only in order that man may have one day in the week to rest, why is it that many who have strictly and quietly rested on the seventh day have been persecuted for not resting on the first day ? They have surely rested one-seventh of the time, and nobody can claim that resting upon the first day of the week will do a man more good than resting upon the seventh. Of course it will be said that the seventh day is not the day that the law recognizes; that the great body of Christians recognize the first day, and therefore the law should demand rest on that day. So then the whole question of the civil Sunday law is given up, and it is admitted that the basis of the law is some supposed superiority of Sunday over other days. It needs no argument to show that all the physical good that may be gained by
