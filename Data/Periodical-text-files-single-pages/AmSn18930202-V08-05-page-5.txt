EB. 2, 189g. AmmEuttc.ANT as interdicted by the Constitution from intermed-dling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline or exercises. This results not only from the provision that no law shall be made respecting the establishment or free exercise of religion, but from that, also, which reserves to the States the powers not delegated to the United States. Cer-tainly, no power to prescribe any religious exer-cise, or to assume authority in religious discipline, has been delegated to the general Government. It must, then, rest with the States as far as it can lie in any human authority-. But it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe, a day of fasting and prayer. That is, that I should indi-rectly assume to the United States an authority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has directly precluded them from. It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it; not, indeed, of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps in public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommen-dation less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed ? I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies, that the general Government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fast-ing and prayer are religious exercises; the enjoin-ing them, an act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises, and the object proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it. In his autobiography Jefferson also relates :Š The bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which had to a certain degree been enacted before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason and of right. It met with opposition, but with some mutilations in the preamble it was finally passed ; and a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be uni-versal. Where the preamble declares that coer-cion is a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion an amendment was proposed by in-serting the word "Jesus Christ," so that it should read, " A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion; " the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the gentile, the Christian and the Mohammedan, the Hindoo and infidel of every denomination. There is no need of any further quota-tions to show that any legislation for the Christian, the religious, or the holy ob-servance of Sunday is entirely beyond the legal power of Congress. Every sentiment and every argument in favor of the observance of Sunday as a Sabbath should therefore have no weight with this committee, or with Congress. The only possible ground left, therefore, for any legislation as to the observance of Sunday is the fact that it is a holiday or rest-day. A holiday is for physical recreation; it is a relief from toil; it is for leisure, or rest from ordinary vocations. What has Congress to do about Sunday legislation, granting that it is a holiday or rest-day ? Simply to recognize it as a holidayŠ but beyond that the function of the na-tional Government does not extend. To start right in this discussion I will again quote from Jefferson :Š Our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us. The idea is quite unfounded that on entering into society we give up any natural right. It is the American principle that the government is for the people and not the people for the government. If at any point government infringes upon any na-tural right at that point its action is null and void. It is a contradiction in terms to say that in order to uphold the natural rights of any human being, the natural rights of  any other human being should be invaded. The exercise of all human rights is per-fectly harmonious. Whatever legislation there is, therefore, for Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, there must be no infringement upon the natural rights of any human being. ENFORCED IDLENESS IS TYRANNY. It is the natural right of every man to labor. Government has no right to for-bid labor on Sunday. If one chooses to labor on that day as on any other day it is his right to do so. For government to enforce physical idleness on Sunday is simply tyranny. Physical recreation, physical recuperation, do not necessarily demand physical idleness. A change of physical activity is oftentimes the most healthful physical recreation, or rest. Government can not enforce idleness any more than it can enforce sleep. As well command a man to sleep all day Sunday as to command him to be idle all day Sunday. This point is well stated in the decision of the Supreme Court of California:Š This argumentŠnamely, that for the benefit of the working people government should enforce idleness on SundayŠis founded on the assumption that mankind are in the habit of working too much, and thereby entailing evil upon society; and that without compulsion, they will not seek the necessary repose which their exhausted natures demand. This is to us a new theory, and is con-tradicted by the history of the past and the obser-vations of the present. We have heard in all ages of declamations and reproaches against the vice of indolence; but we have yet to learn that there has ever been any general complaint of an intemper-ate, vicious, unhealthy, or morbid industry. On the contrary, we know that mankind seek cessa-tion from toil, from the natural influences of self-preservation, in the same manner and as certainly as they seek slumber, relief from pain, or food to appease their hunger. . . . If we can not trust free agents to regulate their own labor, its times and quantity, it is difficult to trust them to make their own contracts. If the legislature could pre-scribe the days of rest for them, then. it would seem that the same power could prescribe the hours to work, rest, and eat.--Ex parte Newman, 9 Cal., 509, 518. The Constitution of the United States plainly declares the manner in which the national Government should legislate, or rather non-legislate, concerning holidays, or rest-days. In the Constitution, Sunday is recognized as a holiday, or rest-day, and only as such. When a bill has passed both houses of Congress for the signature of the President, the President shall have ten days to consider it, Sundays excepted, says the Constitution. Sunday is not a religious or a Christian word. It is sim-ply the secular name of the day. The Christian term is the "Sabbath," or "the Lord's day." By not using either of these sacred names, but using only the secular name, the framers of the Constitution, be-yond question, meant to recognize Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, only, and not in any sense as a holy-day. The Constitu-tion, therefore, recognizing Sunday as a holiday, how does it regulate its observ-ance ? It does not regulate it at all. It leaves the President perfectly free. It gives him the holiday, but it does not com-mand how he shall observe it. It simply allows a privilege. The President can work on Sunday if he chooses; or play; or go to theatres and operas; or hunt and fish; or travel; or stay at home. If the President is a Jew in religion, or a Sev-enth-day Adventist, or a Seventh-day Baptist, the Constitution does not inter-fere with his religious convictions. He can keep holy the Saturday and work on Sunday. This is an admirable example for Con- gress to followŠshining in the Constitu-tion itself, placed there by the wise and far-seeing founders of this Republic. The moment Congress legislates con-cerning the observance of Sunday as a holiday, or rest-day, by forbidding any kind of labor, it violates the religious con-victions of many of the people of this country. They conscientiously observe Saturday as a holy-day. What right has the Government to compel them to lose the value of the following day, either on the plea that it is a holy-day or holiday, or rest-day ? This is a manifest injustice. Follow the Constitution and no injustice will ever be done. In giving the appropriation to the World's Fair, Congress does not undertake to regulate the observance of other holi-days far more national, important, and glorious in their significance than the Sunday. It annexes no condition as to the observance of the Fourth of July or Decoration day. Surely, if Congress can leave the due observance of the Fourth of July or Decoration day to the discretion of the World's Fair Commission, it can also leave the observance of Sunday to the same judgment. Congress does not regulate the expenditure of the millions given to the commission. It has the ut-most confidence in the wisdom and integ-rity of the commission so far as the use of vast sums of money is concerned. Why not leave with the commission the regula-tion of Sunday ? Are the commissioners honest and able six days of the week and inefficient on the seventh day ? or the first day ? As the Constitution left the observ-ance of Sunday to the President, let Con-gress be equally wise, just and business-like in its treatment of the commissioners of the World's FairŠmen selected for their pre-eminent fitness to carry on in all respects this magnificent enterprise. This is my argument, therefore, to the commit-teeŠthat in the very nature of the na-tional Government, and according to the Constitution itself, Congress should not make any laws as to the manner of the observance of holy-days, holidays, or rest-days. The Sunday, therefore, whether it is a holy-day, or holiday, or rest-day, is en-tirely outside of congressional enactment. If there is to be any regulation it should be by municipal and local governments. A Letter from a Lutheran Pastor. Gar Creek, Ind., Jan. 11, 1893. EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL : Inclosed you will find a postal note, my subscrip-tion for the SENTINEL. I have now read your paper for three or four years and like it. I as a Lutheran do not accept all of your teachings but fully endorse your position against a union of Church and State. Our church has resented the attempt in Illinois and Wisconsin, and especially our synod was foremost in the battle. God knows we had rather never entered politics, but politics sought to enter, dominate our church schools, and so it became our sacred duty to take up the gauntlet. We will gladly retire from the political arena, but other issues are at stake and " eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and thus we are forced to do battle again. I am very glad that the SENTINEL was among the few papers (English papers) that correctly saw and stated our position. One expression, recurring several times
