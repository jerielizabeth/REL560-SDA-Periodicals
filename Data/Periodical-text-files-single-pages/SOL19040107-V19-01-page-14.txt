J., on December 18 Henry Popper, "charged with operat-ing a pool-room on Sunday, where thirty-eight young men and boys were arrested by the police recently for Sun-day gambling," was arraigned in the police court. "All those caught in the pool-room were fined $2 and costs each, but the judge afterward returned the fines, and decided to punish the pro-prietor only." It was recently reported, from Day-ton; Ohio, that "an edict has gone forth from the police department that the Sunday saloon must go." There has been "a long cry against the Sunday saloon, as well as a claim that the police department has not enforced the plain letter of the law, and it is now the de-termination of the police authorities that there shall be no more complaint on that score." The Des Moines (Iowa) News of De-cember 21 reported : "Justice Tris will to-morrow hear the case of the State against Aaron Richman, who is charged with having violated the Sunday laws of the State by selling merchandise on that day at his store at 412 East Walnut Street.
