188 AMERICIA:N SE '114±tisTEL, Studies in French History.-14. CHARLIE could hardly wait for an opportunity to ask his father what his opinion was about King Louis. His first chance came at the supper table. Frankie, his little brother, had come in from his play crying, and with an angry flush on his cheek: "Nickey Grimley he called me a cry baby an' a coward, an' said I was stingy'cause I wouldn't help him build a mud house" Šand the blue eyes flashed defiantly,Š"an' I just telled him when I was a big man, I'd have him 'rested an' pit in a black prison, for talkin' so wicked to me!" "It would be better, dear, don't you think," said Mrs. White, "to play in your own yard, and keep away from Nickey, if you can't agree, or else be so nice and kind to him that he won't call you names? It would be dreadful to put him in prison for that, don't you think so?" "I dunno," frowned Frankie, pacified abut not con-vinced. "I told him to stop; but he did it two free times." "Well, Frankie," said Mr. White, "people are never put in prison for such things,ŠI mean they never ought to be," "0 father," began Charlie, eagerly, "I want you to tell me if you don't think it's wrong to blaepheme." "Why, my son! 'you astonish me. You certainly know without asking me that I would rather see my son buried from my sight, than that he should blaspheme the name of the God who made him," replied Mr. White, ear-nestly. "Well, then, father, wouldn't you punish me if I did it?" "If you were persistent in doing so, I dare say I should remember the old-time adage, 'Spare the rod and spoil the child.' " "I thought so," said Charlie, smiling, for he felt quite sure his father would agree with him; so he asked the next question with considerable assurance. "Well, then, didn't King Louis do all right to punish his subjectsifor the same thing? Joe Palmeter thinks he did wrong because he had blasphemers publicly, punished -and I'm pretty sure Professor Carman agreed with him," added Charlie, with an indignant ring in his voice. Mr. White smiled upon the flushed face, upturned to his. "I'm afraid I shall have to agree with them too, Charlie," he said, "Why, father, I thought you said just now that you'd punish me if I did it,ŠI can't see th‚rp,pso:)." "It is right, my son, and, only in obedience to the divinewill that parents should govern their own children, and bring therd up in the fear of -the Lord. But this is not the province.of kings or rulers. It is not the business of the state to tamper in the least with the conscience of any individual. But it is the business of the, church by the word of God to educate the conscience, and to do this in the spirit of the divine Master, who said to the impet-uous disciple when he drew his sword to defend his Lord, `Put up thy sword into its place,' 'My kingdom is not of this world.' No, my boy. We are placed here as free moral agents. The Holy Spirit never compels men. `Whosoever will, let him come.'" "But what business, then, has the state to punish criminals for theft or murder?" "For the safety and protection of other people, my son. If a man blasphemes or breaks the Sabbath, though this is wrong in the sight of heaven, and God will surely impish it at last, it does not in any way interfere with the rights of others in the pursuit of life, liberty or happiness. If the divine, Master rebuked Peter for trying to protect him from personal danger and violence by drawing his sword, how much less would,  he approve of our trying to compel men by force of arms to give him respect and to honor his name. This sin you see is directly against him, and him alone. No; it were-better for poor erring human-ity to leave the punishment of such sins to the Judge of all the earth. He alone can decide justly the measure of the punishment which is their due." "Well, father, I believe I can see the point ! " exclaimed Charlie, while a new light sparkled in his eyes. "I'll tell Professor Carman what you've said." Tuesday afternoon came, and the class in French history, as it was called by the aspiring young pupils, was in its place. "Well, Charlie," began Professor Carman, "I suppose you are willing to take the floor and tell us what your father's opinion is about the conduct of Saint Louis re-specting blasphemers." Charlie blushed and stammered a little, but bravely took his place beside the teacher by the.  desk, and related as nearly as he could the dialogue at the supper table, finishing his little speech with the remark: "I couldn't agree with you at first, professor, but now I am con-vinced you are right." Joe Palmeter smiled approvingly, and his teacher said as Charlie took his seat, "That was about as good, my boy, as an essay on religious liberty. "You will remember that Philip the Bold succeeded his father, King Louis IX., and it was of him that we were speaking when our last study closed. It was during-his reign that the awful massacre called the `Sicilian Vespers' took place. It was caused by the cruel tyranny of Charles, brother of Louis IX., and uncle of Philip the Bold. The pope gave him the crown of Sicily and Naples, having taken it away from the rightful heirs to do so,
