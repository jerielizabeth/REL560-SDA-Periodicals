Nicholas Murray Butler, pres- Ł ident of Columbia University, said in his recent commencement address: " When this college was young, the word that rose of tenest and instinctively to the lips was Liberty. . . . It meant freedom of conscience, of speech, and of the press. Liberty was then the watchword. . . . But during the years that have passed, we have moved away from this view of what is important in life. . . . Not liberty, but regulation and restriction are the watchwords of today, and they are made so in what is sincerely believed to be the greater public interest." TRULY AN ALARMING CONDITION OF THINGS! President of Cuba Indorses " Liberty" " Religious liberty is the basis of civil and political liberty and the best guaranty of peace and prosperity of the nations. . . . The Liberty Magazine, devoted to the defense of these essential principles of civiliza-tion, has my most heartfelt sympathies."Š Mario G. Menocal, President of the Republic of Cuba, letter of Sept. 3, 1914. See page 37. " Nation Ought to Pass Vote of Thanks," Says Congressman " I think the liberty-loving people of this nation ought to pass a vote of thanks to you people for staving off religious legislation all these years. But some day, in spite of all our efforts to hinder it, it will come." Š A Prominent Member of Congress to the Editor of " Liberty." Mayor Sat Up Until Three O'clock Reading " Liberty " An ex-mayor of Pittsburgh instituted a Sunday " blue law " crusade. A committee called and requested him to read a copy of " Liberty." He sat up until three o'clock the next morning, reading it through before he retired. As a result, he was convinced that he was in the wrong, and immediately called off the Sunday-law crusade. He subsequently ex-pressed the desire that " Liberty " be placed in every home in Pittsburgh.
