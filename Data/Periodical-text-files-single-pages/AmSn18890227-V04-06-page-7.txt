THE INDIA PAPER used for the " Oxford " Thin Editions of Bibles is a specialty of the "Oxford" University Press, and is used exclusively for " Oxford " Books. Its characteristics are extreme opacity, great toughness and softness, and an agreeable tone. The strength and flexibility of the fiber are so great that the paper may be used for years without becoming injured by wear; and the material is so opaque that it can be made to a degree of thinness only limited by the possibilities of printing. This paper is beautifully soft to the touch, strong enough to bear a great strain, and of such opacity that the impres-sion on one side does not show through when the other side is being read. The " Oxford " India Paper has been manufactured in order to meet the popular de-mand for thin5books, and is admitted to be without a rival. We carry a full line of " OXFORD " BIBLES in " INDIA PAPER " and all other styles. We also import SPECIAL STYLES NOT CARRIED BY OTHER HOUSES IN THE UNITED STATES.
