Ł PERTINENT QUESTIONS FOR SUNDAY-LAW ADVOCATES. ['A writer who signs himself " Sunday-keeper," pro-pounds in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, of May 29, the following very pertinent questions for those Sunday-keepers who are calling for civil enactments to make Sunday observance compulsory and universal.] St. Paul, May 28. To the Editor : At the recent Baptist Min-isters' Conference, as published in the Pioneer Press, Rev. J. J. Crosby read a paper in which he took the position that a " Sunday law was necessary for the preservation of the sabbath." `Now as this subject of Sunday laws, change of the Constitution, a closer relation between the Church and the Government, is promi-nently before the country, a few questions along this line, suggested by Rev. Mr. Cros-by's paper, will not be out of place at this time. If, as is stated in _Holy Writ, God appointed the Sabbath and said it would be a sign be-tween him and his people forever, did he mean that a condition of the perpetuity of this in-stitution of divine appointment depended on the enactment of laws by legislatures and city councils? The Sabbath being a religious institution, known only through revelation, and intended for those who believe in God and willingly worship and serve him, the same as baptism, prayer and the Lord's supper, would it not be just as reasonable to say that aws were neces- sary for the preservation of baptism, the Lord's supper, etc., as to say that human law was necessary for the preservation of the Sabbath? Ł Would it not be as reasonable to say that human law was necessary for the preservation of the law of gravitation, or the laws control-ing the planets and stars, as to urge that God's divine laws and institutions exist subject to the pleasure of politicians and lawmakers of all shades of belief and of no belief? It is said that about 100,000 people in the United States believe from the fourth com-mandment that the seventh day, or Saturday, is the true Sabbath. These people are grow-ing steadily, and among them are some of the brightest minds in the Church. Now if the Sabbath is to be preserved by civil law, may not the time come when the courts will be called upon to decide from the wording of the fourth commandment which day is the Sabbath? If Sunday-keepers have a right to appeal to civil law, and enact laws compelling Satur-day-keepers and men of no religious belief to cease labor and close their places of business on Sunday, have not Saturday-keepers, when they are in the majority in any community, State or county, the same right to compel Sunday-keepers in like manner to observe Sat-urday? In all the New Testament where is the least inference or intimation, or anything which could even be construed into an appeal by the Saviour or the apostles to the civil au-thorities for assistance or laws to enable them to carry on the work of the early Church, or to preserve any of the Christian institu-tions? If religious institutions are to be preserved by human laws, and people are forced to obey Bible commands, such as relating to the Sab-bath, then what mean the words, "Whoso-ever" will," " Come unto me," He that be- lieveth," " I stand at the door and knock," " We persuade men," etc., etc.? If Christians must appeal to the law to com-pel each other to preserve and obey the insti-tutions of the Church, is it not a sad commen-tary on the massive granite structures and high-salaried shepherds? When the Church allies itself to the State, and uses civil law to carry on its work, does not history show that spirituality departs from the Church, and religious bigotry, intolerance and persecution become manifest? Is this not now being illustrated in different South-ern States, where pious men, and even min-isters, have been sentenced to serve in chain-gangs with criminals because they quietly plowed or hoed in their gardens on Sunday, their persecutors always being so-called Chris-tians? If those who keep the Saturday Sabbath re-quire and ask for no laws to preserve their Sabbath, and never complain of being dis-turbed in their worship on that day, the busi-est and most noisy of the week, why is it that those who keep the Sunday sabbath re-quire a law to preserve their sabbath and demand special laws to protect them from being disturbed in their worship on that day, other than the ordinary protection af-forded all citizens by the police, sheriff, mili-tia, and, if need be, by the army of the United States? If, because a man is a Christian merchant and wishes to observe the Sabbath by closing his store on that day, must all other mer-chants who are not Chistians, and don't be-lieve in, and don't wish to observe the Sab-bath, be compelled to close their stores in honor to the Christian merchant, so that his religion will not cost him anything in the loss of sales he would suffer if his store was closed and others were allowed to be open? Is not the fact that laws are asked for by Christians, to make it easy, of little self-de-nial, loss, cost, and privation to be a Christian, a sure indication of the lack of that faith, zeal, honesty, self-sacrifice, unselfishness and loy-alty among Christians of to-day that charac-terized the early Church and the martyrs of the Reformation? Would the forced or involuntary observance of the sabbath by a man who did not believe in Christianity and the Bible be any more ac-ceptable than the Observance of baptism or the eucharist by a man who had no faith in them? If, as is urged, Sunday laws conduce to mo-rality, would it not be just as reasonable to en- act laws compelling people to become converted and attend religious services for the same purpose? Could not our Christian Endeavor socie- ties and W. C. T. Unions better enhance good citizenship, temperance and social purity by studying and teaching the relation be-tween tea, coffee, tobacco, and other nar-cotics, and the saloon; the relation between the "german," "cotillion" and other dances as led by our fashionable church members, fine apparel, etc., and the brothel; the re- lation between progressive euchre in the churches and the gambling evil; and would it not be better if our high-salaried preachers would add to their faith courage enough to teach the young people some of the great truths of God and of life regarding their bodies, and regarding present social customs, and thus purify the fountain-head of gov-ernment, thus doing the legitimate work of the Church, rather than to appeal to the civil law to do what they have not the courage to do for fear of offending the large society and social-amusement-loving element in their churches and thus lose their financial support? Is not the weakness of our churches to-day principally the result of this semi-political, semi-social and worldly amusement-loving tendency? Are not all civil laws compelling people to observe the sabbath or any other religious in-stitution or ordinance un-American, unconsti-tutional and unchristian? Is not all this religious-law agitation a step backward, and is not the wisdom and almost divinity of the Constitution of the United States apparent when it says: " Congress shall make no laws respecting the establish-ment of religion or prohibiting the free exer-cise thereof?" A PROTEST ON PRINCIPLE. [The Present Truth, London, Eng., June 11.] AT a large meeting, held at the City Temple last week, for the purpose of voicing organized opposition to the Education Bill, Dr. Joseph Parker expressed some sound principles in most unmistakable terms. He said:Š The Bill must be so got rid of that it will never come back again,Šand so must be fought with the central, vital, unchangeable principle that it is no business of the State to provide religious teaching for old or young. If they did not believe that fundamental doctrine, they were by so much Non-conformists. I can understand a man being a mod-erate drinker; I can understand a man being a total abstainer; but I defy him to be both. If I read my New Testament aright, I cannot believe that Jesus Christ would ever say, "Support my religion by taxation, and make my kingdom a branch of the civil service," and turn over his Cross to be a sup-pliant in the court of Caesar. In the expression of these and similar senti-ments the doctor did not shrink, as far as he went, from the logical principles to be deduced from these expressions. He seemed to carry with him the entire audience; yet when others followed who were ready to palter and compro-mise in fact, though dealing in brave words, and whose opposition was mainly selfish blus- ter, the applause was equally as great. It would seem that Dr. Parker has a great edu-cational task on his hands to bring his con-freres to a comprehension of the principles which he enunciates.
