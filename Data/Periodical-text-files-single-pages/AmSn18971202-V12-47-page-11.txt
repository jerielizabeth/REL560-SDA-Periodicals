AMERICAN SENTINEL. 747 Harold's Dream. I'LL tell you what it is, Ray Roberts; I'm captain, and you and the other boys are common soldiers, and you'll have to obey my orders, I tell you!" said Harold Willis. "Napoleon Bonaparte made his soldiers obey him, and I'm going to see that my army is well disci-plined. We'll march over to Mr. Brown's orchard to-morrow night, and help ourselves to the big, red apples that I saw on the tree by the barn to-day. You see," continued Harold, as Ray Roberts 'rose to object, "you see there's lots of them, and Mr. Brown never'll miss them,Šbesides, we're only foraging, like all other sol-diers." "Well," objected Harry Dane," I'm never going to go prowling around after apples in that way even if I am a soldier." "Then I shall put you in the guard-house, and hang you up by the thumbs, and keep you on bread and water !" thundered the pompous young captain, "until you obey orders, sir." "I shall never obey you, Harold Willis ; for I'm sure it's wrong, and my mother would not allow it if she knew, and I'll not do anything to make me feel mean when I look into her eyes." "Very well," said Harold, "come on, boys,ŠI mean soldiers; we'll have nothing to do with him, We won't let him march with us nor hold the flag nor beat the drum nor anything. I'll show you, Harry Dane, that I shall be obeyed;" and the silly boy, with as many of his "soldiers" as he could coax or threaten into submission, started down the street. Harold was naturally a kind-hearted boy, but his desire to make every one come to his exact terms was fast making him a disagreeable, domineering lad. A self-ish desire to rule or ruin was growing stronger and stronger. That night, when he went to bed, his last thoughts were about Harry Dane, and how he could arrange to "bring him to time," as he expressed it. He had not told his mother anything about this grand expedition which he had planned, for he knew very well that she would never allow him to do so disgraceful a deed as to rob Mr. Brown's orchard, even under the pretext that they were only "soldiers, foraging." "I'll bring that boy to terms, or we'll boycott himŠ that's it! we'll revise to play with him or have him in our company," he whispered to himself, as he turned over in bed, and gave his pillow a pat, by way of stronger em-phasis. "Boycott him, will you?" exclaimed a coarse, rough voice in his ear. Harold turned and saw a giant form, more like a demon than a man, with great, dreadful, black wings, and eyes like fiery torches. Harold tried to run away, but the frightened feet refused to move, and the stammering tongue could onlyfalter:Š "Who are you?" "So you believe in making people come to terms, do you? you, believe in boycotting?" was the answer. "Well, I am a great prince, and my name is 'King Might,' and my motto is 'Might makes Right.' You shall be my sub-ject, and I'll show you just how I and my slaves manage that kind of business. Come with me." Then the great arms took Harold up; and the black wings flew away over land and sea. "I don't want to go !" protested Harold. "I want you to take me back home; I don't want to see the way you do bad, wicked things." "0 yes, you do," replied the sneering voice; "if you don't, it doesn't make a bit of difference. That's my businessŠto make people do as I want them to, whether they think it's right or not. Here's some of my work ; what do you think of it, my boy?" Then the frightened lad heard the hum of machinery, and saw long rows of pale, weary looking women, with their lunch baskets in their hands, enter through the gloomy door of the great factory, and he saw them no more. But just as the door closed upon them, one of their number, a pale little woman, with great black eyes, whispered in his ear : "I must work hard, my lad, day after day, for wages which will hardly give my hungry children a morsel of bread daily. I do this that my employer may lay up heaps of shining gold. But God will hear-my prayers, and he will avenge me." "King Might is lord here, you see," croaked the ugly presence, and again the scene changed. Harold stood before the grated cell of a man who looked so kind and benevolent, and withal so pale and worn, that the lad asked him why he was there among such wicked men. "I have done no crime," was the quiet answer. "I am here because I do not agree with the people in my religious belief. I would not care for myself, but my little children need me very sadly." "Well, how do you like the way our principles work? Šour principlesŠyours and mine?" demanded the fierce voice. "If people don't agree with me, I make them, that's all," chuckled the burly fellow. Now I'd like to take you up to Siberia, and let you see a little of my work there among the wretched fellows." And great King Might spread his big, black wings, and bending over, was going to take Harold in his arms again, but he cried and kicked and struggled so desperately that he awoke. He did not sleep again till morning, so fearful was he of seeing the big King Might again; and when, the next
