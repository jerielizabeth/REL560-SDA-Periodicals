WE do not mean that a National Sunday Law is now ready, but that a treatise under this name, prepared by Alonzo T. Jones, is now ready for circulation. This pamphlet contains the arguments in behalf of the rights of American citizens, and in oppositon to the Blair Sunday-rest bill, which Mr. Jones presented before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, Dec. 13, 1888. Mr. Wilbur F. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING," And Mr. Jones's comments will make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruption, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is Based -on Scripture and History, Constitution and Law, Showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-law movement of the fourth century, the Sunday-law movement of the nineteenth century, the methods used in securing indorsements to the petition for the Blair Sunday bill, and the workings of such Sunday laws as are proposed for the United States. The work contains one hundred and ninety-two pages. Price, 25 cents. Address, PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 43 BOND STREET, NEW YORK. Or OAKLAND, CAL. CIVIL GOVERNMENT  AND RELIGION By A. T.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 23 A WRITER in a religious con-temporary says that Italy is a hard soil for the growth of Protes-tantism. On the one hand are the Romanists, upon whom no impression can be made, and upon the other the Infidels, upon whom still less impression is possible. Unbelief among the Italian men, he says, is general in Rome, and their absence from Church is con-spicuous. This state of affairs is not to be wondered at since it is the legitimate result of the Church and State regime which has so long cursed Italy. Men may be compelled to observe the out-ward forms of religion, but that does not make them truly pious, and when the compulsion is re-moved they will surely go far-ther in the other direction than though they had not been coerced. Coercion in religion breeds hatred, and hatred is the very opposite of Christianity.' 0  A RELIGIOUS paper has the fol-lowing, which we pass along for the benefit of our religion-by-law friends :Š " The foolishness of legislating on Bible doctrines should be dis-covered by the comments which such work calls forth from the average newspaper. The follow-ing is a case in point. The Pres-bytery of Cincinnati having voted that all infants dying in infancy are saved, the Cincinnati In-quirer of Nov. 20, 1889, com-ments upon the action as fol-lows :Š " By a vote of twenty-two to eighteen, the Presbytery of Cincinnati concluded that " all infants dying in infancy are saved." Bless their dear little hearts, how they must rejoice at this declaration But let them pause a moment and reflect upon the solemn fact that a change of only three votes would have damned them forever." THE Christian Advocate of this city says :Š That idleness is a prolific cause of vice and crime is made clear by facts con-stantly coming, under the observation of those who read the papers and study the condition of society. This is true, and being true is it not a little strange that so many Łof these who know-  that it is true are, in favor of laws compelling people to be idle one day each week. There can be no doubt that Sabbath keeping is a good thing; but habitual idleness one day each week is not Sabbath-keeping; only those keep a Sab-bath, in any proper sense of the word, who observe the day unto the Lord. The Advocate is right, "idleness is a prolific cause of vice," and therefore all laws that foster idlemss foster vice, They Dry Fast, will not Blur nor Clog the sten-cil, Dry or Harden on Roller or Pallet, and are in every way A SUPERIOR ARTICLE.
