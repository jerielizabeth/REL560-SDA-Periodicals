OCTOBER 8, 1896. SIETkTrIPIN1E1E-4 315 interfere with their rights. If a man, on a Sunday, chooses to hoe in his garden, or to engage in any other peaceful occupation which disturbs no one; he is within his right. Religious liberty is violated if he is mo-lested by the law. This holds good, whatever faith he professes, or if he professes no faith at all. But the case is still stronger when the man is a conscientious follower of a faith which holds sacred the seventh day, and when he attests his conscientiousness by abstaining from labor on that day, and by engaging in public worship. These, the principles of religious liberty, were 'held dear by our Baptist fathers, who suffered for their maintenance. The Baptists of Georgia are a great host, numbering 161,-000 white and 206,000 colored people, prob-ably exceeding in number any other denom-ination. The principles of religious liberty have been firmly and intelligently held by leading Baptists of the State, eminently by Hon. J. L. M. Curry, LL.D., a native of Georgia, now secretary of the Peabody Fund, a distinguished Baptist, than whom no one in the Southern States has a more potent voice. We respectfully and earnestly urge upon Dr. Curry and upon ex-Governor Northen, of Georgia, and other Georgia Baptists, laymen and ministers, to protest against these viola-tions of religious liberty, and to plead with 'their fellow-citizens to do away with laws which belong to the Dark Ages. To the men who are suffering for conscience' sake we extend our most sincere sympathy, as we extend it to the Stundists and to all others of the noble army of men who are enduring hardship for following out their religious convictions. SOME FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. IT is a fundamental principle recognized by all Christians that " we ought to obey God rather than men,"' and that !civil gov-ernment cannot of right have any jurisdiction over the conscience. In a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia in 1776, the Presbytery of Han-over together with the Baptists and Quakers of the colony, said:Š The duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can only be directed by reason and conviction, and is nowhere cognizable but at the tribunal of the Universal Judge. Statesmen too have recognized this princi-ple. Said that noble Kentuckian, Hon. Richard M. Johnson:Š The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of Conscience inalienable.' Even unbelievers in the Christian religion recognize the same great truth. Said Paine:Š Who art thou, by whatever name thou art called, whether a king, a bishop, a State, a parliament, or anything else, vain dust and ashes, that obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his Maker ? Mind thine own concerns. If he believest not as thou believest, it is a proof that thou believest not as he believest, and there is no earthly power can determine between you.3  Almost every American constitution, both State and national, recognizes this right, not only conceded but insisted upon by both be-liever and skeptic. The constitution of Ten- I Acts 6 : 29. 2  Sunday Mail Report, submitted to the House of Repre-sentatives, March 4, 1830. Paine's "Rights of Man," p. 98. nessee provides that "no human authority can, in any ease whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall be given by law to any re-ligious establishment or mode of worship." The Georgia Declaration of Fundamental Rights says: " Perfect freedom of religious sentiment shall be, and the same is hereby, secured." The Maryland Declaration of Rights pro-vides that, " No person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or pro-fession, or for his religious practice." Other similar provisions might be quoted, for, as before remarked, almost every Amer-ican constitution contains similar guarantees of freedom of conscience. But how much do these provisions mean ? Do they guarantee freedom of belief merely ? or are they designed also to insure freedom of action ? If only the former they are mean-ingless. Protestants, Catholics and Liberals, with one voice declare that liberty of con-science implies liberty of action. Says the A. P. A. Magazine for October:Š Freedom of worship is not enjoyed while those who come out from Rome are hounded, persecuted, and mobbed, . . Freedom of worship is not enjoyed when men and women are coerced into believing and doing certain things which they otherwise would not. In like manner Priest Lambert, in his " Notes on Ingersoll, says:Š The right to give an honest thought implies the right to realize that thought in action and habit. If it means less than this, it means simply the right to gabble like an idiot. To the same purpose is the testimony of Mill, who, in discussing this subject, says that from liberty of thought it is impossible to separate liberty of action.' The Principle Violated. Bat though so generally recognized in theory, the principle of religious liberty is fre-quently violated in practice. This is partic- ularly true of laws requiring the observance of Sunday. In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Tennessee, Georgia, Ar-kansas, Mississippi, and Florida, honest, God-fearing men, good neighbors, and worthy cit-izens, have been haled before conrts, and in several of the States named have been fined, imprisoned, and worked in chain-gangs for refusing to do a thing not in accordance with their faith, namely, for refusing to keep Sun-day after having rested on the previous day, according to the letter and spirit of the fourth commandment, as they sincerely believed. (See pages 316, 317.) It is of course claimed by some that these men were imprisoned only for violating the civil law; they were not victims of religious persecution, but of their own temerity in de-liberately transgressing the laws of the land. In deciding one of these cases carried to the United States Circuit Court on writ of habeas corpus, Judge Hammond said, in Memphis, August, 1891:Š Sectarian freedom of religious belief is guaranteed by the constitution [of Tennessee], not in the sense argued here, that King as a Seventh day Adventist, or some other as a Jew, or yet another as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance, but only in the sense that he should not himself be disturbed in the practices of his creed. But is it not evident that this comes far short of the guarantee contained in the Ten-nessee Bill of Rights, and of even the popu-lar conception of religious liberty ? As we have already seen, the A. P. A. Magazine 4 " Essay on Liberty," p. 28. says freedom of worship is not enjoyed when men and women are " coerced into" doing certain things " which they would not other-wise." In his opinion, Judge Hammond as-sumes that the constitution of Tennessee does not contain any guarantee against such com-pulsion, but only assures the citizen against interference with the practices of his own creed. He may be required to conform in some measure to the creeds of others, but this is held to be no interference with his religious liberty so long as he is permitted to practice his own creed! How They Regard the Sabbath. But as a matter of fact it is a part of the creed of the Seventh-day Adventists not only to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath, but not to so observe any other day. Sev-enth-day Adventists do not hold that the fourth commandment requires that a man shall actually work six days of each week whether he has anything to do or not; but they do believe that the fourth commandment establishes a difference between days, that it separates the seventh day from all other days of the weekŠjust as the stamp of the Gov-ernment upon a piece of gold or silver, or other metal, separates and distinguishes that piece of metal from all other pieces of metal, not similarly stamped by the same authority Šand that a Christian is required to respect that distinction; and that just as it would be a crime for anyone to place a similar stamp to that of the Government upon another piece of metal, making it resemble a United States' coin, or to use such a piece of metal after it has been stamped by another, so it is sin to make another day resemble the Sabbath, or to use such a counterfeit after it has been made by another. But it may be said that the line must be drawn somewhere, that it is evident that a man cannot be permitted to do whatever his conscience tells him is right, for him to do. What rule, then, can be adopted which will preserve the authority of the State and yet not trench upon the rights of conscience ? The question thus raised is well answered by the words of Christ: "Render unto Ccesar the things which are Cmsar's ; and unto God the things that are God's." It is also answered by a clause in the constitution of the State of Maryland: " No person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate on ac-count of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice, unless under color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, . . or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights." In this the line is drawn just where it should be, namely, at the equal rights of others. Under this provision the courts are not called upon to judge any man's conscience, but only to judge whether or not his con-science leads him to infringe the equal rights of his fellowmen. That a man's conscience is just what he says it is, no man has either right or occasion to deny. A man's statement of his conscience is an end of controversy; but it does not follow that one has a right to do whatever his conscience tells him is right for him to do. There is a difference between conscience and the rights of conscience. No man, however conscientious, has any right to infringe the equal rights of another; and at this point civil government has a right to take cognizance, not of any man's conscience, but of the relation of his acts to the rights of others. The principle, briefly stated, is this: No man should be either required or forbidden to do any act contrary to conscience, however erroneous that conscience may be, unless the
