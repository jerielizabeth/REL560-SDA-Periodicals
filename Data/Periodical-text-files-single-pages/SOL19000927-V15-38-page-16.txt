Any one receiving The Sentinel of Liberty without having ordered it, may know that it is sent by some friend. Those who have not ordered The Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. Ł IT is affirmed upon good authority that " the pres-ent year has seen a greater number of controversial books against Protestantism issued from Catholic presses than any preceding year." FROM the time of China's war with Japan to that of the " Boxer " uprising the Chinese have evidently been making rapid improvement in the art of fight-ing with modern weapons, and if they continue this rate of improvement the European Powers may ere long find that in essaying.to  " civilize" China they have undertaken a-  larger contract than they can execute. 'A . SPEAKING in behalf of Sunday observance, Hon. John M. Pattison, of Cincinnati, is quoted as warn-ing the liquor dealers that if they pursue a course tending to " the breaking down of the American Sabbath " " the people will finally shut the saloons, not for one day in the week, but for seven." If this is so, then by all means let the saloons pursue just that course. "THE facts of the Indian school question," says the Catholic Mirror, "constitute an urgent plea for Catholic federation." This new federation of Cath-olics is not for political purposes at all, we are as-sured, but we learn from the Mirror that it will be an organization before which politicians and politi-cal parties may be expected to make obesiance. " No public official, no political power, can afford to scorn so many of his fellow-citizens when it is known that they are united, and can, if necessity 'arise, stand together in defense of their rights." The Mirror hopes for a resumption of "pleasant relations " between the Catholic Indian Bureau and the Government, though anticipating "bitter oppo- sition from the bigots." It intimates that this'Cath-olic agency might still be getting money out of the Government if this Catholic federation had been organized years ago. So here it is, in their own words. The purpose of this federation will be to enable Catholics to de-mand Government aid and recognition for institu-tions of their church, and its political power will be strong enough to compel politicians and parties to do its bidding. That is the way the federation will " keep out of politics," and some Protestant societies that we might mention are keeping out of politics in the same way. JA " I HAVE no sympathy," says Rev.. Dr. Talmage, speaking of the Chinese situation, "with the sugges-tion that the Powers should employ force of arms to maintain the status of Christianity in the empire. The day for crusaders has gone by. If China wishes to exclude the Bible from entrance at the open door, then these men and women who wish to carry it to them must prepare themselves for the career of martyrdom, as has been done by Christians in all ages." ot BY the treaty of 1858 between China and the United States the Chinese government is bound to afford protection to Chinese converts to Christianity against physical harm, and now the United States Government is pondering the question whether to withdraw its troops from Peking and leave the Chi-nese Christians to meet the revengeful onslaught of their anti-Christian enemies or to take these con-verts along with its army for protection, thus dis-tinguishing between Christian Chinese and heathen Chinese. The Government does not wish to do either one. .4 .0 RELIGIOUS despotism denies a man the right to think, and civil despotism denies him the right to act.
