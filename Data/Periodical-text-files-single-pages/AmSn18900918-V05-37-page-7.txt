THE NATIONAL SUNDAY LAW THIS PAMPHLET CONTAINS THE ARGUMENTS IN BBNA IX  OF THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BLAIR SUNDAY- REST BILL, WHICH MR. JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, DECEMBER 13, 1888. Mr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING." And Mr. Jones' comments make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of. his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially Legislators, lawyers, judges, and. other public men. The argument is based on Scripture and history, constitution and law, showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-Law Movement of the Fourth Century, AND THE Sunday-Law Movement of the Nineteenth Century. The Methods Used in Securing Indorsements to the Petition for the Blair Bill, and the Workings of Such Sunday Laws as are Proposed for the United States.

JONES, One of the Editors of the AMERICAN SENTINEL. Scriptural, Logical, Plain, and Forcible. THIS. IMPORTANT WORK SHOWS CLEARLY THE RELATION THAT SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE AT THE PRESENT TIME, AS PROVEN BY THE BIBLE AND HISTORY OF THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE CENTURIES. CHAP. I outlines vividly the relation that existed between "Christianity and the Roman Empire." CHAP. II distinguishes between " What is due to God and what to Ciesar." CHAP. III shows for what purpose the " Powers that Be " are ordained. CHAP. IV ably discusses "The Religious Attack upon the United States Constitution, and Those Who Are Making it." CHAP. V unmasks "Religious Legislation," calling special attention to the Blair Sunday Bill now pending in Congress. CHAP. VI  is devoted to the "Sunday-Law Movement in the Fourth Century, and its Parallel in the Nineteenth." Chap. VII shows The Workings of Sunday Laws when they are enforced. These chapters, with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States which are printed in Appendices 0 and D, make this treatise INDISPENSABLE TO EVERY LOVER OF CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

Cal. The above is the title of a treatise written by the author at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a dis-cussion upon the present aspect and aims of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as the Papacy, or Vaticanism, is outlined in the prophecies of Holy Scriptures with sufficient accuracy to determine what the " Papacy " is, and what is to be its future devel-opment and ultimate end.
