340 THE AMERICAN ,`ENTINEI.,. our churches and congregations on the ground of its temperance and other moral reformatory work, to interfere with the management of the said church. The evidence of the truth of this state-ment is now to be submitted. Its State Convelitidn8 are in the habit of passing resolutions commending female suffrage ; its National Conventions have done the same. It is so closely connected with the original Female Suffrage Association that the assistant editor of the Woman's Jewrnal, Alice Stone Blackwell, is also the Assistant Superintendent of the Department of Franchise of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. (One of the principal text-books, if not the chief, in the Depart-ment of Franchise in the Woman's Chris-tian Temperance Union is John Stuart Mill's Subjection of Woman, whose author repudiated Christianity as a supernatural religion, and on various occasions de-nounced it as an oppressor of women.) Female suffrage has become one of its chief corner-stones, so that temperance and- its allied moral questions, according to the prophet whom we heard in San Francisco, are now made the draft-horses to bear the female suffrage movement on-ward: In harmony with this partnership we find a long article in the Woman's Journal, organ of the old-line Female- Suffragists, for September 18:Š This is a subject-of great moment, not only to the church it which the important-action is to betaken, but also to the cause of woman's emancipation hi all its various phases. All the friends of woman's advancement, whateVer their religious views may be; should do their utitioat- to rouse those upon whom the decision devolves to an active and intelligent inteitst in the-question. . . . The resolution does not involve the, question of licensing and ordaining woman to preseh, but the relation of women to the legislative councils of the elitirch will eventually determine their positions and privileges in the- ministry. Great is the change which has taken place in the Woman's Christian Temper-ance Union, and most interesting is the method by Whieh it has been brought abet*. When these ideae,---never thought of in the-incipleney- of the organizationŠwere-first breached, some who were pos-itively and uncompromisingly opposed to them were gradually displaced; others Whih-  were More malleable were surrounded by "an frill...Um-0e," were spoken of as "1rue and good," but as " not having yet seen the,  heavenly vision which had been revealed " tip-  the leaders. If in process Of time they saw this vision, according to theii4- gifts- and' usefulness they rose; but if they still continued in darkness, grad-ually they were frozen out until it came to hi understood that only those who hold these printifileS and adhere to them should be admitted, whatever their interest in tetapartinee and 'the reformation of men, to hitportant positions. Hence it has come tEY poi -that this organization is an active prOpagandiaing,  power for woman suffrage a4c1 allied guidons. We have now to show that the Union Signal, its official organ, loses no oppor- tunity of discussing the Methodist Epis-copal Church and its movements-in relation to the ecclesiastical position of women. The attempt is made to connect the deaconess movement in our church with the ordination of women in the ministry. Observe this, and a declaration of the faith of the Woman's Christian Temper- ance Union in the following, taken from a recent copy of that paper The training school for Deaconesses in Chicago, under the care of Mrs. Lucy Rider Meyer, is on a broad plane, and deserves the study of all interested in this great problem. Its evolution will naturally conduct to the final emancipation of woman, by which she will enter the pulpit on the same plane with her brother man, and they two will prove that, inspired by the Spirit of the Highest, they are ade-quate to the conversion of the world; that life in wickedness can never be saved by the ministrations of one-half the unit. This is the faith of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. firmly held and frankly stated, Various of its organizations passed res-olutions condemning the General Confer-ence of the Methodist Episcopal Church by name for its rejection, on a point of law, of women from membership in the last General Conference ;Šin one instance classing it in a paragraph of condemnation with certain liquor dealers. Soon after the adjournment of that Gen-eral Conference the National Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was held in the Metropolitan Opera House, in the city of New York, and at that Miss Frances E. Willard delivered her annual address as President, from which we quote what to us is an astonish-ing passage. Quoting what persons have said to her, she said:Š " Stay in the church, and help reform it," says one " No; that is impossible ; old churches and old parties are equally crystallized," comes the reply. " Let the Woman's Christian Temperance Union organize a church; and we will join it, every man of us," is the declaration of an influential group of earnest men. "No, we have too many churches already," objects a listener; "let the wheat and tares grow together until the harvest." . . But for myself I love my mothevehuteh so well, and recognize so thoroughly that the base and body of the great pyramid she forms are broader than its apex, that I would fain give her a little time in which to deal justly by the great household of her loving, loyal, and devoted daughters. I would wait four years longer in fervent hope and prayer that the great body of her ministers and of her member-ship may make it manifest to all the world that the church of Lady Huntingdon, Barbara Heck, and Phebe Palmer does not hesitate to march with the progressive age it has done so much to educate, nor fear to carry to their logical sequence its life-long teachings as to woman's equality within the house of God. I say this frankly, from my present out-look, though 80' often urged; and not a little tempted; and sometimes quite determined to take a new de-parture. The time will come, however, and not many years from now, when, if presentation IS Still denied us, it will be our solemn duty to raise once more the cry, " Here I stand, I can do no other," and step out into the larger liberty of a religions movement where majorities and not minorities shall  determine the fitness of women as delegatefi, and where the laying on of hands in consecration, as was undoubtedly done in the early Church, shall be  decreed on a bails of "gifts, graces, and useful-ness," irrespective of sex." [The italics in the above quotation are the Advocate's.] This is a professedly undenominational body, and it has had remarkable assistance from the Methodist Episcopal Church in resolutions passed by the General Confer-ence, in the use of church buildings, and in the giving of its notices by the pastors. When the Woman's Christian Temperance Union discusses the church in this way, and in such a spirit, after it had submitted the question to 'a vote of its ministers and members, and interferes by a declaration which has the force of a threat, we are compelled to say, that while it shows how many are the ramifications of this movementŠit does not furnish ground for the presumption that the legislation or the real interest of the Methodist Episcopal Church would be benefited if the change called for were made. It must be true, for Miss Willard de-clares it, that " an influential group of earnest men have called upon the Wom-an's Christian Temperance Union ' to or-ganize a church!' " It is not wonderful that such things should ainct the judg-ment of the recipient of such confidence. If such a spirit exists, the church should know it. With genuine admiration for Miss Willard's gifts, and full recognition of her varied services, but with the faith-fulness of friendship, we assure her, that were the Woman's Christian Temperance Union to attempt to "organize a church," that " group of influential men " would fail to stand by it or her, and if they did  the organization would simply add another to the successors of Jonah's gourd, instead of continuing a growing power for good. It is a matter of astonishment and grief to us, that our old friend, Professor Luther T. Townsend, whose intellectual gifts and personal character we have always ad-mired, should strengthen such dangerous advisers by writing thus in his article on " Woman in the Pulpit," addressed to and published by Miss Willard These noble women should: knock only once more at the doors of the Methodist General Conference, and if their signals and entreaties are again uncivilly disregarded, they should never knock again; they should call together some of the noblest Christian women of the land, and in- solemn convocation, by the laying on of hands and by prayer, they should set apart for pulpit and parish work those who trust that they are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon themselves the office of the min-istry of the Church. of Christ, to serve God, for the promoting of his glory and the edifying of his peo-ple. . . . When that step is taken, if these women: are willing to extend an invitation, they will be-surprised at the number of clergymen who, with a noble Wesleyan spirit, will hasten to render assistance at the ordination. It is su©h passages which have, as,  we regret to have to say, led the justly dis-tinguished and worthily loved woman into such utterance as this quoted from her annual address- of 1888. In. Miss Willard's address in 1889 at the National Convention she called for, a res-
