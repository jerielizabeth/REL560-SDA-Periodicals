AMERICAN SENTINEL. 391 The Lust of Conquest. "The Christian Advocate," New York City. ME intoxication of partial success and the mania for expansion have already so turned the heads of many that they say Washington in his farewell address did not have in view the possible development of the United States, but only suggested the course for the republic to pursue in its infancy. No sober mind can believe this proposi-tion. "Europe," said Washington, "has a set of primary interests which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. . . Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyances, when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by justice shall counsel." The underlying idea of Washington in his address is the permanent isolation of the United States, the keeping ourselves free from such relation to foreign governments as would necessitate us "to impli-cate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissi-tudes of the politics of Europe, or the ordinary combina-tions and collisions of her friendships or enmities." He knew perfectly well what 'tendencies would be developed in the nation. No prophet saw more distinctly the peril which prosperity would bring in its train; hence he closed by saying:Š "In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish, Šthat they will control the usual current of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the 'destiny of nations. But if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism, this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your wel-fare, by which they have been dictated." Toss Washington's farewell address to the winds; affirm that the time has come for the United States to set up a policy of imperialism, to compete with England, France, Germany. and Russia in colonizing the far East ! That will at least have the merit of consistency; but the insinuation that Washington did not foresee the very situation in which we now are, stamps the person or the paper who makes it as already far along toward that color-blindness which puts "bitter for sweet, and calls evil good." The cry now is, "Annex Hawaii as a war measure, as  made necessary by the capture of Manila." "Reassert our claims upon Samoa; we shall then have stepping-stones through the whole Pacific." "Awake to the fact that together with the Philippines come the Mariana Is-lands, the Pelews, and the Carolines." These stretch eastward from the Philippines about forty-five degrees of latitude. On that basis the cry is raised "that a little further north and east are the Hawaiians. Should the United States then build one of the isthmian canals, she will not only control the oceanic water passage, but in the most strategic portion of the Pacific Ocean she can, as it were, cross that vast expanse of ocean upon her own stepping-stones." Nor have the buccaneer party forgotten the Canaries and Balearic Isles. The former they will turn into a huge fortified sanitarium and prospecting center for our share of Africa. The Balearic Isles will intrench us in the heart of Europe. They add that "of course these acqui-sitions will widen the market for American capital and products; and we must be ready to dig ship canals, lay ocean cables, and enlarge our army and navy so as to equal those of any other nation." Judging from what we have seen as respects war and other measures, and the efforts of the majority of the representatives in Congress and in the press, of each of the great parties, to outrun each other, it is quite within the bounds of possibility that there may be "a division of parties on issues compared with which tariff and finance may seem small." It is cause for regret that the President of the United States has committed himself so earnestly to the annex-ation of Hawaii as to make it almost necessary, in the estimation of many of his congressional constituents, to enter upon this course. It has been a great stimulus to all other schemes of territorial aggrandizement. Once entered upon, we may be sure that it will be car-ried to the last extent. One of the greatest evils result-ing from one act of folly, in individuals or in nations, is the necessity, under the color of consistency and under the impulse of the force developed, of an indefinite num-ber of acts of equal or greater folly. Rarely are men or nations willing to acknowledge in the face of the world that their past actions were unwise. When that great standing army and that immense navy shall have been gathered, and the United States shall be competing with the monarchies and republics of the Old World, the idea that it can escape the complica-tions and the final overthrow which destroyed every large republic on the face of the globe, prior to itself, is an illusion born of covetousness and vanity. The worst of it is that those legislators who launch it upon such a career will neither suffer upon the field of battle, in the present war, nor have to endure any of the final consequences which their frenzy will entail upon, the generations that come after them. "My sheep hear my voice."
