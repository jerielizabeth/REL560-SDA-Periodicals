LIBERTY 89 any way upon the subject of religion, its substance, its definitions, its forms, its institutions, or its observances. The First Amendment was thought by some to be unnecessary, for the reason that, as stated in Article X of the Constitution, " the powers not del-egated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." But the Constitution is no longer regarded as highly as it once was. The ques-tion said to have been asked some years ago by a Texas statesman, " What is the Constitution between friends? " simply represents a state of mind, not of an individual here and there having a personal interest in overriding the Constitution, but the careless, indifferent state of the public mind, which has, TERCE THE NET? ceased to be jealous for the preservation of the Constitution, even in its most important features: and that notwithstanding it is the safeguard of our liber-ties, the charter of our rights as American citizens. Some of the associations whose names appear upon the underwater craft in the cartoon, freely admit that the measures they advocate are subversive of the Constitution as originally adopted and as it now is, and for this reason they demand that this charter of our liberties be so amended as to admit the legislation they seek. But we cannot believe that the Amer-ican people are ready for such a step as that. Our greatest danger is not that the Constitution will be amended, but that it will be over-ridden. Let us hope that in the present crisis the Constitution may not fail, through the indifference of the people, to afford that protection which it was designed to give, not only directly to our ship of state, but incidentally to the individual citizen. " Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
