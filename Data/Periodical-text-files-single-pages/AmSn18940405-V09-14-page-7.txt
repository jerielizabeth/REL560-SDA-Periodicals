APRIL 5, 1894. CO _Lk l‚T SIE NT rIr IE 111 Sabbath, they will die before they will do it. Under the laws of Georgia, to thus refuse to work is mutiny, and they are liable to be shot down on the spot. Wm. P. T. Lake Weir, Fla. The Church and Constitution. THE attempt of certain ministers to se-cure an amendment to the Constitution by which that instrument will be given a religious tone is questionable in wisdom. Their desire is to have inserted this or some similar phrase, " In God's appointed `ay through Jesus Christ," with a pur-pose to have the Constitution recognize the influence of the Christian faith in government. Ł A great deal might be said in support of the proposition in a purely religious way, but the precedent of giving to this instrument any religious signifi-cance whatever might justify proceedings in future that would give a distinct de-nominational drift to a principle of nation-alism, the virtue of which now is that it gives equal shelter and security and equal-ity to all religious sentiment and belief. It surely cannot be contended that the introduction of the name of God into the Constitution would tend to the better es-tablishment of religion, for such a conten-tion would be equivalent to the admission that religion needs a constitutional.recog-nition and support. It should not be con-tended either that the Christian faith re-quires any such bulwark, for that would be to admit the dependence of the Chris-tian faith for its life and propagation upon legislative provisions, a confession of weakness that the Christian Church should be slow to make. The zeal that attempts now, at this late day, to change the na-tional basis from a purely secular to a constructively religious character reflects more credit upon the spiritual enthusiasm than upon the patriotic judgment of those who are actuated by it. The Church should not seek reinforce-ment from the Government. The wisdom of the fathers of the Republic in making a distinct separation of Church and State was the result of experience with a con-trary state of affairs, and their determina-tion to avoid, in the new experiment of government, the conditions that had been productive of so much friction and so many evils in the government from which they had divorced this country should not now be lightly estimated, the more partic-ularly when there is something of a reli-gious contention impending. If the Constitution may be amended to take account of the Christian faith or church, why may it not with equal pro-priety be amended in some future time to recognize, specifically, some branch or division of the 'Christian Church ? If now may be inserted the phrase, " In God's appointed way through Jesus Christ," after a time there may be a future amend-ment so that the declaration shall read : " In God's appointed way through Jesus Christ and his vice-regent on earth, the holy Roman pontiff." It is a dangerous thing our zealous preachers propose, and our legislators in Congress should be made to understand that the sentiment of the American people is opposed emphatically to any religious interference whatever with a Constitution, the great glory of which is its absolute equity toward all humanity irrespective of race or creed or Ł lack of creed.ŠThe Inter Ocean.

Hence,, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the. condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the stand-ard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new form of paganism..  The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.
