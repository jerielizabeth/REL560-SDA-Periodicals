A Prophecy and a Promise Remarkable Tribute to America by the Poet Shelley, Written Ninety Years Ago Dr. I. W. Heysinger, of Philadelphia, writes the following stirring communication:Ñ " I would like to have you quote the burning panegyric on this country at the close of the eleventh canto of Shelley's wonderful Revolt of Islam,' written in the summer of 1817, shortly after the close of our second war with Great Britain. It was written in Great Britain, and has never, so far as I know, before been printed in a newspaper: Ñ There is a people mighty in its youth, A land beyond the oceans of the West, Where, though with rudest rites, Freedom and Truth Are worshiped; from a glorious mother's breast, Who, since high Athens fell, among the rest Sate like the Queen of Nations, but in woe, By inbred monsters outraged and oppressed, Turns to her chainless child for succor now, It draws the milk of power in wisdom's fullest flow. Th? t land is like an eagle, whose young gaze Feeds on the noontide beam, whose golden plume Floats moveless on the storm, and in the blaze Of sunrise gleams when e7rth is wrapped in gloom. An epitaph of glory for the tomb Of murdered Europe may thy fame be made. Great people! as the sands shalt thou bccome; Thy growth is swift as morn, when night must fade ; The multitudinous earth shall sleep beneath thy shade. Yes, in the desert there is built a home For Freedom. Genius is made strong to rear The monuments of man beneath the dome Of a new heaven; myriads assemble there, Whom the proud lords of man, in rage or fear, Drive from their wasted homes: the boon I pray. Nay, start not at the name Ñ America! " It would be well, indeed, for all our people to keep this child chain-less. Have we done so? Or to make it chainless? Will we do so? The verses embody a prophecy and a promise."Ñ The Washington Herald, July 4, 1908.
