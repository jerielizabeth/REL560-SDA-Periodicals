PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR MM. The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, JANUARY 22, 1903 NO. 4 When there are no other grounds for its support, when we cannot say that the general welfare; is benefited, when there is no reason for a law but a theological reasonŠunder such circumstances is a law defensible? . . . This is aŁ  very important question, and one that at the outset of any discussion of Sabbatarian legislation must be well settled. . . . I am not asking any of you to change your opinion as to the proper method of comporting yourselves on Sunday, for the question under debate is not what you  wish to do on Sunday or even what you would like to see other people do. We are discussing your right to impose your views upon me and my right to prescribe conduct for you. Ought we to proceed upon merely theological grounds? . . . The reasons against such a course are numerous and overwhelming. . . . If we adopt the-ological opinion as a true basis of legislation we are in reality supplying a strong argument in favor of the reunion of church and state, for we at once encounter the second question, Whose theology are we to enforce? Clearly we cannot turn all the conflicting dogmas into statutes. Go-ing no further than this Sunday question, for example, are we to adopt the Protestant or the Catholic view of it? Or, are we to determine God's law at the ballot box, and, hav-ing voted upon the subject, enforce the view of the majority? Are we to have a Protestant Sunday in Manitoba and Catholic saints' days and fasting during Lent in Quebec? . . I assert that no one has a right to bind his the- ology upon any one's back but his own. ŠJOHN S. EWART, K. C.
