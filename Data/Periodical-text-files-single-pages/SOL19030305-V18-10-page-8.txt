152 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY not only forbidden by statute law, on religious grounds, and treated as an im-moral act, and the offender unceremo-niously punished without (in some cases) even the semblance of a trial, or the en-joyment of any of the rights and privi-leges which are allowed by reason, justice, humanity, and constitutional law to others charged with the perpetration of the most infamous crimes. On what principle is the labor of learn-ing the mechanical art of writing allowed on Sunday, other than because it is use-ful to those engaged at it, and injurious to none others in the community ?* For what other reason are their teachers per-mitted to labor in their vocation on the Sabbath day, than because it is useful labor, virtuous industry, and beneficial not only to those engaged in it but to society generally? For what other cause are men allowed, nay required by law, to labor on board of ferry-boats on Sun-day, than because such labor is useful, necessary, and beneficial to the public, inasmuch as it accommodates those en-gaged in traveling on business or for pleasure, thereby admitting that traveling for either purpose is not a crime; for was it so, the law granting facilities to those engaged in it would be particeps criminis, and those who made it, as well as those who support it, would come in for a merited portion of the censure. What possible objection then on the score of morality can be reasonably and consist-ently urged against other kinds of volun-tary, useful labor, or any innocent recrea-tions, which conduce to the health or com-fort of those who engage in them without doing injury to others or disturbing them in the exercise of their equal right (when- * It seems that when this was written the teaching of writing on Sunday was permitted. There are many other things permitted to-day that are just as pertinent to the purposes of the argument.Å EDITOR. ever they please) to suspend their labor and engage in their religious devotions ? Legislative Acts and Authority with Respect to the Matter Should be Scrutinized, Analyzed, and Measured I would have it explicitly understood that I have no desire to interpose objec-tions to a general suspension of business and labor one day in the week as a secular measure. On the contrary I think the custom conducive of much utility and ought not to be abolished. But with a view to guard, as the constitution of this State [New York] has done, against " acts of spiritual oppression and intol-erance," and also with an eye to the preservation of the liberties of the people, they ought to scrutinize the motives, the manner, and the means by which the community have been forced to keep a religious sabbath day, and analyze the right of the legislature to interdict labor and recreation as a political or secular regulation, and likewise to ascertain and measure the extent of their coercive au-thority on the subject. Would the people submit to legislative coercion to observe and keep a thanks-giving or fast day, and acquiesce in the legislative interdiction of labor or recre-ation on either of them? And should it be attempted to force it on them under the pretense of its being a civil or secular regulation, would not the pretext be too flimsy and the disguise too thin and frail to conceal from the people the real object and true character of the measure? The knowledge that the people would not, or the conviction that they ought not, quietly to submit to such unauthorized constraint, has doubtless prevented the political au-thorities of the State from venturing beyond the only right they have in those and similar cases, to recommend to the people the observance of fast and thanks-giving days and the suspension of busi-ness, labor and recreation for those pur-
