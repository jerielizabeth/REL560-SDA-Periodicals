THE law is all right as a fence, but it is of no use as a walking-stick. - 44'  WHEN a nation tries to make itself Christian, it al-ways makes itself anti-Christian. ,I14- Ł 44' Nom the Spaniards in Cuba, but the saloons in Amer-ica, are the real curse of the Western hemisphere. THERE is no person so dextrous that he can wield both the sword of steel and the "sword of the Spirit" at -the same time. Ł IF professors of Christianity had never gone into pol-itics, the professedly Christian Church would never have been responsible for religious persecution. • Ł 4.  "REVERENCE for law" does not go to the foundation of good government. Without reverence for right, there would be few laws in the land that were worthy of rev-erence. 444  To say that the government is superior to the indi-viduals who have formed it, is to say that the creator is inferior to the thing which he creates.
