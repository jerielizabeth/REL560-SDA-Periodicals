"(1 FliIEND IN THE KITCHEN." WE have no apology to offer in bringing to the attention of our readers a cook book discarding an article of diet which is everywhere known to contain disease-producing germs, often of a most virulent type. While "A Friend in the Kitchen" contains no flesh food recipes, it does contain an abundance of that which is most palatable and whole-some, and it also tells how the foods may be prepared in the best possibleway. Its 400 recipes are inter-spersed with short talks on foods and food combina- tions and other items of practical value and importance to every housewife, as Ł well as to those who wish to study the subject of diet for their own benefit. Remember it contains about 400 carefully tested recipes. The binding is 'a new preparation resembling leather, is almost as durable, and may be washed the same as oilcloth. Price 60 cents postpaid.
