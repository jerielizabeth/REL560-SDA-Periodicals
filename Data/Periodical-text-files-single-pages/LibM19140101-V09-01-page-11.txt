Lev. 25:10. VOL. IX  FIRST QUARTER, 1914  No. William Jennings Bryan on the Statute for Establishing Religious Freedom JEFFERSON was a political philosopher, and thought far in advance of his time. And yet he differed in one essen-tial particular from the phi-losophers who do not live to see the triumph of their ideas. He proclaimed great, living truths, and then he applied those truths to the questions with which he had to deal. Some have contented them-selves with laying down ab-stract principles, and have not sought to give them vitality in the present day ; but Jefferson not only saw the future, but he saw the present, and we have this great advantage in the study of the principles of Jefferson, that he gave us those principles embodied in legisla-tion. I have been more and more sur-prised as I have studied the questions with which we have to deal, to find that there is no subject with which our peo-ple grapple today that he did not con-sider in principle. Take the questions that are subjects of controversy, and you will find that he stated principles and applied principles at that time that apply to the questions at this time ; and today we do not have to go beyond his writings to find principles that will solve aright the problems of today. He saw great, funda-mental truths, self-evident truths, if you  please ; and I am coming to believe that there are not only self-evident truths, but that all truth is self-evident Ñ that the best service that a man can render to a truth is to state it so that it can be un-derstood. Jefferson had the power of statement, and he stated the truths so they could be understood. . . . I place far above any purchase of acres or square miles, the ut-terance of those truths upon which hu-man liberty must rest. Philosophy is above geography. Jefferson rightly measured his own work when he looked back over a long and eventful life, and, ignoring the foot-hills of honor, saw only the mountain peaks of service. He gave to us proof that the Bible is right when it fixes serv-ice as the measure of greatness. You will remember that when there was a controversy as to which should be great-est in the kingdom of heaven, and the question was brought to Jesus, he said : " Let him who would be chiefest among you be the servant of all." So Jefferson, when he looked back over his life, saw, not the things that he had received, but the things that he had given to the world ; not the things men had done for him, but the things he had done for mankind. 5
