         Vol.. 0. go. 17.               priation bill containing an appropriation of $45,700 for charitable institutions, a part at least of which was for sectarian institutions, and in the same bill we wiped out one poor little Protestant mission chapel standing on Government land. I offered an amend-ment in relation to that chapel which was rejected, and the vote by which my amendment was rejected is not correctly stated in the Record, probably through inad-vertence. On page 3460 appears the following:Š Ma. MORSE. I ask for a division. The committee divided, and there wereŠayes 3, noes 60. In fact, Mr. Speaker, there were 6 ayes that I saw, namely, Messrs. Grow, Springer, Blair, Hudson, Liv-ingston, and Morse, and perhaps more I did not see. There was only about a third of a quorum present and three hundred members of the House were absent. THE SPEAKER pro tempore. The correction will be made. It is not until the next day that the matter receives its, final quietus, when the matter of Mr. Morses' correction was called up and discussed at some length. This motion then prevailed Mn. SIMPSON. I move to strike out the whole Cor-rection, inasmuch as it reflects on every member of this House, charging us with having voted an appro-priation for sectarian purposes. I think for that rea-son the motion to strike out the whole correction should be agreed to. This was what was filially done and the whole correction eliminated from the Record. But as will be seen by those who read these extracts, the discussion will serve to point several morals quite sharply. These are some of the appropriations made :Š For the Church Orphanage Association of St. John's Parish, maintenance, $1,181. For the German Orphan Asylum, maintenance, $1,181. For the National Association for the Relief of Desti-tute Colored Women and Children, maintenance, in-cluding its care of colored foundlings, $7,680. For St. Ann's Infant Asylum, maintenance, $3,840. For St. Joseph's Asylum, maintenance, $1,181. For the Association for Works of Mercy, mainte-nance, $1,181. For House of Good Shepherd, maintenance, $4,773. For the Industrial Home School, maintenance, $7,680. For St. Rose's Industrial School, maintenance, $2,953. Some of these names point their own moral. The sensitiveness to the accusa-tion of appropriating for sectarian reli-gious purposes, combined with the will-ingness to appropriate for charitable reli-gion in general, is noticeable. The shrewd attempt of Mr. Morse to advertise the names of those who voted with him, to his religious constituency, is also to be noted, as well as the determina-tion on the part of others that this should not be done. Truly the "national irreli-gion " is making very much the same progress in Congress that it is in the courts and municipal ordinances of the country at large. There are two distinctively religious measures now before congressional com-mittees, viz.: The religious amendment to the Constitution, and the Sunday law for the District of Columbia. It is understood that Mr. Blair, now in the House, will soon reintroduce his famous bill for a " national Sunday law." W. H. M. Washington, D. C. do declare from my heart, without mental reservation, that his holiness pope Š is Christ's Vicar-General, and is the true and only head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth; and that by the virtue of the keys of binding and loosing given to his holiness by Jesus Christ, he hath power to depose heretical kings, princes, States, commonwealths, and governments, all being illegal without his sacred con-firmation, and that they may safely be destroyed; therefore, to the utmost of my power, I shall and will defend this doctrine and his holiness' rights and customs against all usurpers of the heretical or Prot-estant authority whatsoever, especially against the new pretended authority and Church of England, and all adherents, in regard that they and she be usurpal and heretical, opposing' the sacred mother church of Rome. I do renounce and disown my allegiance as due to any heretical king, prince, or State, named Protestants, or obedience to any of their inferior magistrates or officers. I do further declare the doc-trine of the Church of England, of the Calvinists, Huguenots, and other Protestants, to be damnable, and those to be damned who will not forsake the same. I do further, declare, that I will help, assist, and advise all, or any of his holiness' agents in any place wher-ever I shall be; and do my utmost to extirpate the heretical Protestants' doctrines, and to destroy all their pretended powers, regal or otherwise. I do further promise and declare, that notwithstanding I am dis-pensed to assume any religion heretical, for the prop-agation of the mother church's interest, to keep secret and private all her agents' counsels, as they entrust me, and not to divulge, directly or indirectly, by word, writing or circumstances whatsoever, but shall exe-cute all which shall be proposed, given in charge, or discovered unto me, by you my ghostly father, or by any of this sacred convent. All which, I, A. B., do swear by the blessed Trinity and blessed sacrament, which I am now to receive, to perform and on my part to keep inviolably; and do call all the heavenly and glorious host of heaven to witness these my real intentions to keep this my oath. In testimony whereof, I take this most holy and blessed sacrament of the Eucharist, and witness the same further with my hand and seal, in the face of this holy covenant, this Šday An. Dom., etc.ŠPapal Rome As It Is, pg. 223-225. It will be seen that these minions of the papacy are the sworn enemies of every government on earth save that of the pope only; and that to effect the objects of their order they will not hesitate to profess any Protestant or heathen faith under the sun. They will obtrude themselves into public schools as teachers; and upon the rostrum as lecturers, and preachers, as-suming for the occasion a sacerdotal or citizen's garb. Says the "Religious Encyclopoedia " :Š Their Christianity, chameleon-like, readily assumed the color of every religion where it happened to be in-troduced. They freely permitted their converts to retain a full proportion of the old superstitions, and suppressed, without hesitation, any point in the new faith which was likely to bear hard on their prejudices or propensities. They proceeded to still greater lengths; and besides suppressing the truths of revela-tion, devised the most absurd falsehoods, to be used for attracting disciples, or even to be taught as parts of Christianity. One of them in India produced a pedigree to prove his own descent from Brahma; and another in America assured a native chief that Christ had been a valiant and victorious warrior, who, in the space of three years, had scalped an incredible number of men, women and children.ŠP. 689. Says Giustiniani, who was a convert from Jesuitism:Š He is a monarchist in Austria, a revolutionist in France, an autocrat in Italy, and a republican in the United States.ŠPapal Rome As It Is, p. 219. In Rome they are not only the chief counselors of every project, but the executors of every plan framed by the secret council of the VaticanŠId., p. 818. The United States is the fruitful field of the Jesuits. Already they control all the principal cities of the country. They have also organized many Roman Catholic military societies, ostensibly as United States militia, and they are officered by some of the most skillful generals of the country. And what constitutes the greatest source of danger to the country is that Protes-tants look upon the growing power of the papacy with stolid indifference. Says Chiniquy :Š The Americans, with few exceptions, do not pay any attention to the dark cloud which is rising at their horizon, from Rome. Though that cloud is filled with rivers of tears and blood, they let it grow and rise without even caring how they will escape from the impending hurricane.ŠFifty Years in Rome, p. 671. There will be an awakening in this country by and by, but it will come too late to save the nation. Only the few who are forewarned will escape the fearful consequences of the general disregard of Jesuitical intrigue. A. SMITH. The Progress of Religious Legislation at Washington. THE Washington Post, of March 21, under the head of " Capitol Chat," has the following paragraph :Š Thousands of petitions have come through the mails within the last fortnight from religious societies and others interested asking that favorable action be taken upon the joint resolution now before the House Judi-ciary Committee to insert the name of the Deity in the Federal Constitution. Some of the petitions are several yards long and all are numerously signed. They come principally from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania. They are addressed to the two Houses of Congress. The committee has decided that it will not give a hearing to persons who desire to oppose the resolution, but it is generally understood that the resolution will be reported adversely, although it was at first intended to take no action on it whatever, but to permit it to slumber in the committee. This is the most pronounced expression in reference to the attitude of the Judiciary Committee as to the religious amendment to the Constitution, and the action that the committee proposes to take, which has yet been given out. The interpolation into the preamble of the Constitution, which is sought, is so palpably in antag-onism to the First Amendment and so clearly a reversion to a Church and State polity that it seems astonishing that any man possessi4 sufficient intelligence to reach and retain a seat in Congress could be found willing to offer, much less champion, such a bill. But the measure is known to actually have its supporters, to the number of two at least, even in the House Judiciary Committee itself. Thus, however ignominious a fate may befall this amendment now, this fact is vividly suggestive as to what may be the success eventually of this long-sought treason to both government and religion. Mr. Morse's bill, " to protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the Dis-trict of Columbia," it is understood, will be referred by the House Committee on the District of 'Columbia, in whose hands it now is, to the District Commissioners for their action thereupon. It is not known yet what the views of the commis-sioners are upon the matter. Mr. Douglas, who was an outspoken and rabid legal and political religionist, is no longer a member of the board. Had such a measure been presented to the commissioners while he was one of them it would have been per-fectly certain what the recommendation would have been. In fact he once em-bodied in an annual report to the Presi-dent, regarding district affairs, a sugges-tion as to the enactment of just such a law for the district. The fact that the House Committee makes this disposition of the bill argues nothing decisive in reference to it either way, but shows that the committee dis-likes to assume the responsibility of defin-ite action either way, and wishes to share the onus of whatever is done in regard to it jointly with the commissioners, or per-haps shoulder upon them the entire respon-sibility of the decision. The bill is openly and professedly reli-  Jesuitism : Our Great Danger.  THE society of Jesuits, one of the most celebrated orders of the Roman Catholic Church, was founded by Ignatius Loyola in 1540. The reigning pope, Paul III., immediately by his bull, sanctioned the institution, The following is a copy of the Jesuit oath :Š L A. B., now in the presence of Almighty God, the blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the arch-angel, the blessed St. John the Baptist, the holy apos-tles St. Peter and St. Paul, and the saints and the sacred host of heaven, and to you my ghostly father,
