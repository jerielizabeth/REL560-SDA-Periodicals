AMERICAN SENTINEL. 389 beyond our traditional policy, but the future is certain to so force all who do not speedily avail themselves of the only refuge that can possibly be of any avail in the time of trouble just before us. "God is our refuge and strength. A very present help in [this impending] trouble." In Him is safety. Out of Him there is nothing but certain destruction. c. P. B. Items of W. C. T. U. History. BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY. IN prosecuting the Scientific Temperance Educational work of the W. C. T. U. as it concerned schools and col-leges, it would have seemed when a State legislature had been persuaded into giving the authority of law to our efforts that at least the Rubicon had been crossed; and I am afraid that many of even our most earnest women had such an impression, and thought the time to "slack up" a little might be at hand. But there was yet many a perilous passage for the heroic leader in this en-terprise and her band of devoted co-laborers. Not yet did the wisest fully understand the cunning of the foe with whom we had to deal; nor could they dream of the alert interest with which that foe watched every move of the W. C. T. U.; nor how deeply he was concerned as to the possible consequences to his business of even a simple call to prayer, or a meeting for consultation by a little band of timid women known as a "committee." It took us years to find out how we were appreciated by the saloon power and why; we could not comprehend the motives that were back of its activities. It was al-most impossible for us to separate the father from the man. We could but suppose that every father would be glad of any truth that would save his son from drunken-ness, and protect his daughter from the fate of a drunk-ard's wife, even if it did interfere with so called business. So we felt that in this Scientific Temperance Educational plan we had something upon which all would unite, espe-cially if the legislatures would give us the right sort of help. We had become a little shy of legislatures; but the peopleŠthey would surely be with us in this. And after the laws had been granted in State after State, with so many tokens of appreciation, what could be in the way of success? The next step was taken with new courage. A litera-ture was demanded. School books would be a necessity, such as would cleariy set forth the principles which the new law required should be taught in the public schools. Mrs. Hunt, as the head of this department, began at once the labor of supplying this demand from the most scien-tific sources; and others began to make provision also; for the eye of greed had at once seen that there was "money in it;" and the liquor traffic, realizing what it would mean to its business to have the boys made afraid of all alcoholic liquors; and the dealers in tobacco, what it would mean to them to have the true science of their  product fully unfolded to the ambitious minds of growing athletes, both had their eyes upon that Scientific Temper-ance Educational department and its laws, and began toŁ  plan to meet it on its own ground. Books was a game that two could play at; and could not publishers and .school superintendents, as well asŁ teachers, be influenced by such considerations as great business interests might possibly bring to bear? Judg-ing all the world from their own standpoint, they natu-rally thought that any people but "women who had no sense" could be influenced; and thus began a war of wits and of influences; with truth, prayers, and life itself on one side; error, destruction, hard cash and cunning on the other. Books have been met with books; total ab-stinence, as a scientific principle by a so-called science, which is always willing to lend itself against truth for the sake of its client, Self-Indulgence. [t has been a bitter contest and the end is not yet. It would be of interest to read the history of investi-gation and its counterfeit, assumption. It would be a revelation of intrigue, duplicity, and fraud, such as could scarcely be believed, but of which the reports are carefully kept, as one belligerent always keeps any weapons which chance to fall into his hands, against a time when they might be turned upon the enemy. The position of the W. C. T. U. concerning the use of alcoholic drinks was taken at first on what might be called a deliberate impulse; and, because it was so mani-fest that the drug was an enemy to every live tissue, we had the utmost confidence that science would "support the motion," with the force of a "unanimous vote." And yet as attack after attack has been made upon the point in question, while we have never for an instant doubted that the eternal truth was standing by us, itŁ  has often been a question as to whether we should be so able to bring those who were standing between us and the growing children, to acknowledge it; and so give the children a fair chance to know, beyond cavil, just what the truth is, before this generation, like so many before it, should become a prey to vice. And as so many years have already passed, and the controversy is still soŁ  fiercely waging, and the laborers are dropping so rapidly by the way, but for the knowledge that truth is truth forever although it may lie covered with chaff at the bot-tom of the bin, the stoutest hearts would begin to fail them in this struggle. At different times it has seemed as though the enemy had really stolen a march on us, captured the fort, and turned the long range guns of educational influence which the White Ribbon Host had mounted, directly upon the innocent rank and file of the Nursery Brigade, and were about to sweep them all into the awful ruin of a besotted age. But by the almost superhuman efforts which have been put forth, and by the blessing of the Holy SpiritŁ  whose light sets all things in their true relation one to another, the danger that science shall be made to even appear to stultify herself on this question seems to have passed. She has spoken for us in reply to our question-
