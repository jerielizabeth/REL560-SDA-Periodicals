M. Ł                            that Mr. Allison was not sentenced to the chain-gang for injuring his neighbors; no, not even for disturbing them. Since he had not injured any one, either in reputation, person, or property, what had he done so heinous as to take him from his fam-ily and business and consign him as a felon to twelve months' chain-gang labor with the vilest of malefactors ? " Why, what evil hath he done ?" In reply to this grave question, let the words of the presiding judge be submitted as they appear in the official record of the trial:Š The Court. . . . The trouble is this, that if you are allowed to do thisŠI understand you are a good man your neighbors say you are, there is nothing in the world against youŠbut if you are allowed to do this, bad men would claim the same privilege, and desecrate what the great majority of people con-sider the Sabbath; but outside of any reason for it, that is the law. In this single sentence we have combined the admission of innocence, the secret reason for condemnation, and the retreat behind the law, which characterized the trial and con-demnation of the Son of God. The secret reason given by the rulers for desiring the death of Christ, was: " If we let this man thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation." John 11 : 48. Thus it is seen that the secret reason for his death was that they could not sustain their creed against the teaching and example of his life. So in this case it is admitted in an un-guarded moment that Mr. Allison's irreproach-able life will teach other men the truth that the State-enforced Sabbath is not the Sabbath of the Bible, contrary to the belief of " the great majority of the people." But immedi-ately perceiving that this " reason " betrayed the ecclesiastical nature of the law and its administration, the court hastens to take shel-ter behind the law, thus: " Outside of any reason for it, that is the law." " We have a law, and by that law he ought to die." Let those who condemn the rulers of Israel for demanding the life of an innocent man, because " we have a law," explain why they can to-day condemn an innocent man to the chain-gang because they are the " great ma-jority ' and " have a law" which makes it possible. A strange feature of all these cases is that the accusers, and in some instances; State officials, look upon the conscience of a Sev-enth-day Adventist as a kind of weather vane to be shifted to accord with every human or-dinance. Do they think that faithfulness to conscience has perished from the earth, that God has abdicated the throne in favor of hu-man law ? It is passing strange that they do not shrink from the awful responsibility of attempting to crush a dissenting minority. Do they not dread to add to that torrent of tears, that ocean of anguish, represented in the Apocalyp-tic vision as pouring into the ear of Omnip-otence, with the eloquent voice of woe, that imploring question, " How long, 0 Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" Rev. 6: 10. Should Seventh-day Adventists weary of courts, fines, confiscation of goods, imprison-ments and chain-gangs,Šshould they yield to the demand that they treat the Sunday-Sab-bath, which they for sufficient reasons regard as the mark or badge of papal apostasy, with the same outward regard which they pay to the Sabbath of the Lord, the sign of the true God; will the representatives of these perse-cuting States appear in judgment with the statement that since they declared Sunday to be the Sabbath of the Lord and compelled the Seventh-day Adventists to observe it, there-fore they demand in the name of the com-monwealth that the condemned be pronounced guiltless ? At that great and final judgment there will be no foreign minister to unfurl his country's flag over the violator of heaven's law, and demand and enforce protection in the name of his government. States may secure for their citizens safe conducts through a country with which they have diplomatic relations, but not through the country of the " King of kings." Yet, in the face of all this, man, mortal man, whose life is as a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away; this puny man that must himself stand at the bar of God and answer for his own acts, this same man will presume to interpret the Word of God and force his fellow-mortals to accept of his interpretation, or suffer in prisons and chain-gangs. Could anything be more presumptuous ? Ye rulers of States and of nations, Who trace with a fallible pen "Infallible" creed-born statutes To fetter the conscience of men ; Whose laws conflict with Jehovah's, And brand on the brow or the hand A counterfeit seal of that statute Proclaimed from the mountain-top grand; If we sever our sign of allegiance To the King of kings on high, If we'll wear thy sign of rebellion, And our Maker and Saviour deny ; If we yield to thy chain-gangs and prisons, If we bow to thy cruel decree, If we take our allegiance from heaven And join it forever to thee; Wilt- thou promise to meet us-in judgment, When the Court is in session on high, And enforce the decision thou'st rendered, And the judgments of heaven defy? , Wilt thou hoist o'er the shelterless sinner Thy glorious banner of State And demand the verdict "not guilty," In the name of thy commonwealth great ? Wilt thou rally thy minions to battle, And march on the City of Light, Whence angels excelling in power Were hurled to the regions of night ? Wilt thou compass the City Eternal, Its towers and battlements raze, And train thy batteries brazen On the throne of the Ancient of Days ? Canst thou brook His glory consuming, Or challenge the bolts of His wrath, And drag Him, a trophy adorning Thy chariot's conquering path Canst thou fetter the feet of Jehovah And chain him with breakers of stone ? Will Omnipotence bow to your statute.Š Surrender His right to the throne? Dost thou shrink from a contest so awful, And tremble at thought of His might; Wouldst then hide 'neath the rock and the mountain Away from his presence so bright ? Then ask not of subjects who serve Him With 'love that scorns at the grave, To violate laws of His kingdom, And trust in your power to save. WHEREAS it is unhealthy, un-American, and unlady-like to appear in such costumes. We are not so much concerned about this so-called bloomer " craze" as we are with the craze among would-be statesmen to make of the State a kind of foster mother, whose busi-ness it is to feed, clothe and catechise its cit-izens. There was a time in the history of England when the government prescribed cer-tain apparel for its citizens on the ground of protecting their health, but we supposed we had outlived such paternalism. But it seems that in this matter we were mistaken, for one branch of the Minnesota Legislature actually passed a bill compelling men to act patriot-ically on Memorial Day. But a law forbidding women to wear bloomers on sanitary grounds, and a law enforcing patriotism are less unrea-sonable than is a law compelling all citizens to act piously on Sunday. The first two are unreasonable and un-American, the last is not only unreasonable and un-American, but posi-tively unchristian. WHAT IS ROME'S SYSTEM P  TEE Monitor took upon itself the task of defining in what the ritual of the sect to which the AMERICAN SENTINEL belongs, was "summed up." We replied, showing that we have no ritual at all, and also showing the dis-tinction between Christianity and ritualism, which is simply the difference between Chris-tianity and Catholicism. In this we said that " the whole Roman Catholic system is only one of forms, of ceremony, of ritual. In that system all such things are used as means Šas ' means of grace 'Šwith the hope of thereby obtaining Christ. Rome's is a system of salvationŠjustificationŠby works." Upon this the Monitor says:Š To which we reply that the SENTINEL knows nothing --absolutely nothing about Rome's system. How does the Monitor know this? How is it that the Monitor knew so much about the " ritual" of the SENTINEL as to be able to sum it up in a single sentence? How is it that the Monitor knows anything at all about the SENTINEL or its " ritual ? Perhaps the Monitor will say that it has read and studied the subject. Very good. But is it a fact already decided by the Monitor that the editors of the SENTINEL cannotŠabsolutely cannot read or- study at all ? If the Monitor admits that the editors of the SENTINEL can read and study, then in that it certainly ad- mits that our means of knowing about Rome's system is precisely as good as is that of the editor of the Monitor to know about the " ritual " or anything else pertaining to the SENTINEL. This is remarked, however, merely in pass- ing. The material point of the Monitor's reply is as to whether in the Catholic system, forms and ceremoniesŠritualŠare " means of grace." This the Monitor vigorously denies in these words:Š We do not look upon forms or ceremonies or ritual as means of grace. There is only one source of grace and that is Jesus Christ. There is only one giver of grace and that is Jesus Christ. . . . Now, as Christ is the dispenser of grace, can't he dispense it as he wills and how he wills ? If he will have it flow through certain channels, who is Alonzo T. Jones that he will say nay to Omnipotence ? If Christ's virtue went out through the hem of his garment, what is to prevent it from going out through the waters of bap-tism ? And if Catholics believe that the employment of baptism is the way appointed by the Lord for the conferring of regenerationŠthe way by whichŠnot the water, not the form, butŠChrist himself confers regeneration, what right has the AMERICAN SENTINEL to accuse us of barren ritualism ? This would-be denial is a full confession of all that the SENTINEL charged. We never         PATERNALISM.  A PROPOSED ordinance has been presented in the Chicago Council forbidding female per- sons " to ride or attempt to ride any bicycle or tricycle or to publicly promenade in the streets, avenues, or public highways of said city while dressed or arrayed in costumes com- monly known as bloomers, knickerbocker, baseball attire, or trousers." The reasons given in the preamble for the passage of the ordinance, are :Š WHEREAS, this craze [for wearing bloomers] has as-sumed such proportions that it menaces the public morals of this good city; and
