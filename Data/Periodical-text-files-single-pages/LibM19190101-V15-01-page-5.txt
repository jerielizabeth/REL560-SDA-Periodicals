XIV  FIRST QUARTER, 1919  NO. 1 The Termination and Achievements of the Great War By the Editor THE cessation of hostilities and the coming of peace have occasioned great rejoicing among the allied and associated pow* that brought the war to a successful conclusidti. The great conflict ended almost as suddenly and dramatically as it began. The complete collapse of the most powerful and perfectly organized mili-tary machine that this world has ever seen should teach the govern-ments of earth a lasting lesson concerning mili-tarism. It should teach all men that the spirit of truth and liberty resident in the hearts of a free people is greater than organized despotism and might.

The feelings of Presi-dent Wilson, of mingled joy and satisfaction, must have been inde-scribable when he penned these words, proclaiming the triumph of democracy over autocracy. It was not a selfish feeling of personal gratification, but generous joy in the triumph of a common cause, that the inherent rights of the people had triumphed over the assumed rights of kings. The great war through which we have just passed has resulted in a glorious victory for civil and religious freedom for all the people of the earth. The old barriers which hitherto
