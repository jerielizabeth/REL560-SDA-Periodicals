XIX WASHINGTON, D. c.,THURSDAY, JANUARY 14, 1904 No. 2 Sunday-Law Oppression in Philadelphia Again Some Interesting Developments THE principal article in The Sentinel of three weeks ago pointed out that while the reasonable and necessary in-ference from a Sunday statute itself (the New York Sunday law of seventy years ago was under consideration, but the points made are substantially true of the Sunday laws of the various States to-day) is that it deals with and prohibits acts that belong in that class of crimes that cannot be lawfully punished in any American State with-out the intervention of grand and petit juries, it nevertheless provides for and directs the punishment -of the offender by deprivation of property or personal liberty without such intervention, but simply upon the personal judgment and determination of a judicial officer of the very lowest grade.

Well, one of the interesting develop-ments in this crusade of illegal Sunday-"law" enforcement in Philadelphia has been intervention on the part of a grand juryŠnot very serious interven-tion, it is true, but serious enough to be very gratifying to all friends of right and justice, and therefore of law indeed, and to be somewhat of an as-tonishment to the instigators of the crusade Š the champions of the illegal Sunday " law " and its illegal enforce-ment. The day following the hearing in Magistrate South's court on Decem-ber 3, when "more than ninety cases of Sunday selling in violation of the
