NOTE.ŠAny one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may- know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invari-able rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office. State, the foreigh ministers and consular service. But in the expression of this a remarkable inconsistency is developed. The Mail and Express, which, directed by the Sabbath Union president, has been, and is, the month-piece of organized re-ligio-legal intolerance at home, suddenly ' becomes an active advocate of religious liberty abroad. This paper says:Š The Secretary of State has done well to make prompt demand upon his Imperial Majesty, Abdul Hamid II. for indemnity for the destruction of American property in Konia. But Mr. John W. Foster will do better by following that up with a demand that the Mohammedan shall grant reli-gious liberty for the whole world. Here is an arena for American diplomacy which it ought not to hes-itate to enter. Certainly; here is an arena for diplo-macy. Is Mr. John W. Foster to under-take this diplomatic task for the State or for the Church, or for the State Church, as a diplomat and a statesman or as a diplomatic State churchman ? The idea of the Mail and Express very evidently is that while Mr. Foster has done com-mendably in a matter which was strictly within his sphere as a representative of the authority of the State, he would do still better, if he would assume to him-self the authority of the State Church and demand something beyond the mere civil rights of the citizens of the United States resident in a foreign country. - _0Š IT does not seem to be the civil injustice which American citizens have suffered in Turkey that calls out this article. The ;editorial pen has been stirred to point out the exact spot on the map into which Mr. `Foster should throw his gauntlet, his pen, .and his prayer-book, that he might step 'into the ring to do battle nominally for all three but really for the last. The editorial continues :Š The constant persecutions kept up by the,Turks upon every form of religionists except their own and the intolerance and false beliefs forced upon them by their own ecclesiastics, excite the abhor-rence of all other nations, as well as their wonder that such things can exist in this Christian era . . the nations should unite in conferring upon the whole Turkish empire the benefits of ab-solute religious liberty. Here is a task for Mr. Foster's .diplo-macy,Što secure the co-operation of the whole family of missionary nations in se-curing compulsory religious liberty,within the dominions of the unspeakable Turk, for the Turkish subjects themselves, as well as for others. After presenting in two considerable paragraphs the very proper claims of hu-manity, the article proceeds:Š The present seems peculiarly fit for insisting upon religious liberty, for the Sultan is vigorously threatened with revolt by his Armenian subjects on account of their religious persecutions; and the German evangelistic institutions are threatened all through the empire; and England has had many of her gospel endeavors frustrated and their estab-lishments seized. Moreover, the Sultan's Greek subjects are desiring a better way; and even his Moslem subjects are confessing that there is some-thing in Jesus superior to Mohammed. Germany and England, at least, would seem to be distinctly classed- with the United States as missionary nations, for Germany is spoken of as evangelizing, and England as making gospel endeavors which have been frustrated. Is it the gospel of Christ that is preached by an armed diplomacy which points to its armies and its navies- to enforce its re-quirements? They who take the sword Shall perish by the sword ! Can it ever be a fit time to insist upon religious liberty abroad and practice religious intolerance at home ! England and Germany are  State Chtirch nations; they have ac-cepted religion as nations and have as-sumed the National Reform religious status of true moral persons, with moral character and responsibility, accountable directly to God. They both consider it their conscientious duty to enforce legal and religious disabilities upon dissenters, Štheir own creed does not provide for civil Ł freedom in religious affairs. In this, Tur-key differs from them only in degree. It is evident that the Mail and Express is in error here. It would be an unfortunate mistake in the religious diplomacy Mr. Foster is urged to undertake if he should draw this " Christian " Nation into an al-liance, for such a purpose, with hypocrit-ical missionary nations whose home prac-tice could be so easily proved to be directly contrary to their foreign preaching. Cer-tainly England and Germany have not absolute religious liberty ; how then could they " unite in conferring upon the whole Turkish empire the benefits of absolute liberty " which they themselves do not possess? Šo--- THE United States is to take the lead in this great missionary enterprise by which the moral being of the "sick man of the East " is to be regenerated. The last para-graph of this foreign mission editorial is an exhortation :Š Now is the time for this Christian American Na-tion to step forward as the champion of religious liberty in the Orient, and lead the way in such ne-gotiations between all, the Christian nations that they shall unitedly dictate to the Sultan the aban-donment of his bigotry and the establishment of absolute religious liberty throughout his empire. This is a field promising a triumph to American diplomacy. Will Mr. Foster be courageous enough to enter it? Will Mr. Foster enter it? He would know, as a diplomat, that it would not yield success if not in accord with the re-ligion professed by the Nation. The ,United States has professed a religion. That religion is the religion of which the observance of Sunday is the distinguish-ing mark. The decree of court and of Congress has established this mark. Those who dissent are branded as disloyal and are subject to penalties. The State re-ligion professed by the United States, then, does not differ in this respect from that of Germany and England. Neither of these powers could urge or attempt to enforce Upon Turkey that which is contrary to their own tenets. Full civil freedom in religion is contrary to the theory and practice of all three of these powers,Što preach it to Turkey or attempt to enforce it there, would therefore prove them to be themselves in error in their own profes-sions. It would not be wise statesman-ship. in Mr. Foster, to prove the re-ligious profession of this Nation in error by insisting upon the adoption by Turkey Of principles contrary to those in vogue here. Mr. Foster, as an intelligent diplo-Mat, will not enter this field.

THE political and national profession of Christianity by the United States, in its governmental capacity, if practically ap-plied, is likely to produce some very unique ' international situations. If the Government, as a corporate person, can and does accept a religion, it must, as a governmental power, go forth and preach it to all the world. Š0Š THE Congress of the United States has undertaken to enforce a religious observ-ance upon its own citizens, and the sub-jects of all other powers as well, at the city of Chicago, upon the occasion of the holding of the World's Fair. Is this the beginning of a world wide effort by this Government to evangelize all nations ? He who profesks a religious belief, is bound in conscience to preach the truth which he believes, and sacrifice himself, his time, his means, his labor to present it to the minds and impress it upon the hearts of all men. THOSE who have constituted and called themselves " National Reformers," and who originated this movement for the legal enforcement of national religion, which is now bearing fruit, have said :- 1. The Nation is a collective being, with moral character and accountability, directly responsible to the Author of its existence, God himself. 2. As such a moral, being, a true moral person, it is under the moral law of the Supreme Ruler of nations, which includes both the law of nature and the revealed will of God. If this Nation is such a being, endued with moral accountability, and respon-sible directly to God, then, having made before the nations of the world, by a Su-preme Court decision and by religious legislation, a public profession of religion, it is bound in honor, and the requirements of religious consistency, as well as. in con-science, to actively evangelize, not only at home but abroad. In fact, as this is a Christian Nation, there will be no need of evangelization at home and the entire available force of the Nation, in men and money,' capable of being mobilized, can be thrown at once into the foreign mission-ary field. Š0Š Tim editor:president of the American Sabbath Union has evidently grasped some of these great possibilities, which this adoption of a national religion offers, for proselyting among the nations of the earth. He proposes to utilize immedi-ately, in this great work our Secretary of
