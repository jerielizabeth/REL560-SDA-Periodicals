CHRISTIANITY is not a cult; it is the life of_God in the soul. .4  .4  THE gospel and the gospel only " is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." .4 .4  GOD in Christ Jesus reconciles the world unto.  himself. CiVil law has no part in the work of sal: vation. .4  .0 RIGHTS being God-given and inherent can not be destroyed nor cease to be though their exercise may be denied. .4 .4 Two things are essential to the 'formation of moral character, first, moral law, and, second, free-dom of choice: One'who always did right simply because he could not do wrong would never develop moral character; and this is the ever and all-suffi-cient answer to all cavils as to the wisdom of Gbd in permitting sin.
