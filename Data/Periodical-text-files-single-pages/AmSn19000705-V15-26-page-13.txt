       THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. 41;                                  A dispatch from San Juan de Porto Rico, under date of June 27, says: "At a teachers' conference, held here yesterday evening, Dr. Saldana, a member of the insular board of education, during the course of an address remarked that the Catholic religion should again be introduced into the public schools of Porto Rico. "Dr. Campos Valladares, a Portuguese Presbyteri-an, superintendent of public instruction in Brazil, took exception to Dr. Saldana's remark, and, turning to Bishop Blenk (the bishop of Porto Rico), he said, in substance, that the Catholic church had been negative in results in all the South American countries, assert-ing that the illiteracy prevailing there was due entirely to the church's influence. This remark caused great excitement. No sooner were the words uttered than Bishop Blenk jumped to his feet, and, striking the table with his closed fist, shouted : 'It's a lie,' adding, 'I will not sit quietly and hear the church of which I am the representative in Porto Rico traduced in such language.' "After a painful silence, by a common impulse the adherents of the bishop shouted as with one voice: `Long live Catholicism,' and the incident was closed, though it has aroused much feeling." This is a point upon which Rome is very tender. It was very inconsiderate, to say the least, for Dr. Valladares to give utterances to such a distasteful truth in the presence of a Catholic bishop. Possibly, how-ever, he did it to give the bishop opportunity to show what manner of spirit he was of. The Koloniale Zeitschrift (Berlin), one of the jingo members of the German press says : "The Americans no longer connect ideas of liberty with the views expressed by Monroe. Materialism, imperialism, and low selfishness are their predominant motives, as the annexation of Hawaii and the Spanish-American war have shown. The Monroe doctrine is a mere phrase, which does not find approval in South America or in Europe. But phrases frighten nobody, and it is doubtful that the Yankees want war for the sake of phrases. The power of the United States is not overrated in Europe as much as in America. The Americans should remember that their offer to take part in the settlement of Crete was met by a pitying smile, and that their hero Dewey became silent when Admiral von Diedriches ordered his ships ready for action. If the United States were actually to uphold the Monroe doctrine, the answer would come from the mouth of cannon." The St. Petersburger Zeitung remarks that "the United States government is reported to have ordered its consuls in South America to report on the numbers and attitude of the German settlers in South Ameri-ca," and then adds, "It is hardly to be believed that the Washington government can be so foolish as to meddle with matters which are absolutely no business  of theirs. Germans have a right to settle where they please, as numerously as they please?' "It is notable that the French press," says the Zeitung, "also aims to make Germany and the United States enemies. The French have not forgiven the disaster to Spain, and they are anxious to involve the United States in a quarrel with a real power." Josiah Allen's Wife Goes a Visiting. "Josiah Allen's Wife" has sharpened up her pen again, and with her patient, amiable, unobtrusive hus-band "goes a-visitin' " for the Ladies' Home Journal. Every one, knowing that Josiah's wife is "obsarvant" and "critikal," can anticipate that in laying bare the shortcomings and mistakes of those she visits she will have abundant opportunity fog the exercise of her quaint humor and homely philosophy. In the course of her "visitin' " she finds many things to set right, and there is a definite purpose underlying all her sketches. "Josiah and I Go a-Visitin" is perhaps the best series that Mrs. Holly has ever writtenŠsu-perior even to her description of the Centennial which established her reputation as a humorist-philosopher of the first order. The first sketch of this new series will be published in the August Journal. Why Jefferson Wrote the Declaration of Independence. "It has always been a curious puzzle why Franklin, the man of ripe age, of commanding distinction and of approved literary skill, was not selected to write this declaration instead of Thomas Jefferson, then only thirty-three years old and comparatively unknown," says John Gilmer Speed, in The Saturday Evening Post. "It could not be that Franklin was passed by because he had done everything within his power to avert the war and reconcile the differences between the Colonies and the Mother Country, for all wise men in the Colonies did all that honor permitted in that di-rection until the die was cast. No, it was not a fear of Franklin's earnestness in the cause of the ColoniesŠit was probably the fear of Franklin's humor. Ł "He was not only the greatest man of his time, but he was one of the greatest humorists of any time. And so his associates were possibly afraid that he would put a joke in the Declaration, and passed him by and selected the lank young Virginian with the freckled face. "As it was, Franklin did have his joke, for when the members of Congress were about to sign the Declaration, Hancock, whose earnestness is expressed in the bold signature which comes first, said in his own earnest way: 'We must be unanimous ; there must be no pulling different ways ; we must all hang together.' " 'Yes,' replied Franklin, 'we must hang together or we shall be pretty sure to hang separately.' "
