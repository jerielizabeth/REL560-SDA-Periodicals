THE CHURCH AND THE WORD THE Church is' born of the word of promise through faith. and is nour-ished and preserved by the same word; that is. she herself is established by the promises of God, not the promise of God by her. The word of God is incompara-bI- above the Church, and her part is not to establish, ordain, or make anything in it. but only to be established. or-dained, and made ass creature. Š PERYEAQS1.00.
