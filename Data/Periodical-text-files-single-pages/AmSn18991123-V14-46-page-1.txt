Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay forit. (Entered at the New York Postoffice.) IT is not the name of a thing, but the principle it embodies, that determines its character. .4 at WHEN a Protestant church goes into politics, it be-comes papal in everything but its name. .4 .4 To "PUT God into the Constitution," is to try to harness a God of love to a government of force. .4 .4 EVERY Sunday law, or other religious statute, rep-resents an attempt of the legislature to be conscience for the people. SOME good people look so steadfastly at the legal aspect of affairs that they lose sight altogether of their moral aspect.

The Jews stood ready to accuse Pilate of being an enemy of Caesar and a traitor to the Roman govern-ment; so that Pilate was likely not only to lose his po-sition, but his head as well! Surely, then, Pilate was justified in breaking the command of God, if ever such an act could be justified. He tried to persuade himself thus, and brought water and washed his hands before
