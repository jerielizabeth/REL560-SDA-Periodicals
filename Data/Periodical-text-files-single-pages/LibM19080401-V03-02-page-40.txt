38 LIBERTY lamb slain from the foundation of the world," and individual, full, complete, and perfect free-will acceptance of that invi-tation. No carnal weapons, no man-made laws, and no compelling force in human hands find any place whatever in God's scheme of redemption. The right of every person, who has ar-rived at the age of accountability, to wor-ship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, regardless of the religious views of others, and the privilege of every such individual to refuse to worship God at all, so long as he permits the evil tendencies within to forbid the entrance of the Holy Spirit, are God-given rights, which physical force will thwart only when directed by satanic influences. The colonists who settled along the At-lantic seaboard in North America, were mostly refugees who had fled from relig-ious persecutions in the mother countries; but they soon manifested the same spirit of oppression, and exerted like unchristian force as that which had driven them into the wilderness, and made for the colonies laws to fetter conscience and control relig-ious action. As the Episcopal church in Virginia was joined (married as it were), to the local government for the annoyance and oppres-sion of Bptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Lutherans, and others, so, in like manner, the Puritans, in New England, deserted Christ, the true bridegroom, for an adulter-ous marriage with government, to the end that those of different conscientious views on matters religious, might be made to feel the sting of the law for their honest con-victions, as they, themselves, had felt a like sting beyond the waters: But, Roger Will-iams (doubtless called of God for the pur-pose), and his Baptist following, sowed the seeds of religious liberty, which they gath-ered from the everlasting gospel, the fruits of which were manifest in later years, and especially in the stand for liberty of con-science taken by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other great statesmen and patriots, and which culminated in guaranties of religious liberty in the Constitution of the United States and in the constitutions of all the States of the union. and thus the United States became an asylum for the con-science-fettered of all nations, and the  boasted land of freedom in matters relig-ious, with a prohibition, of no uncertain sound, in the fundamental law of the nation and that of every State in the nation, against the union of church and state in any of its hideous forms. Notwithstanding these constitutional guaranties, which every official is sworn to support, and which every loyal citizen is in duty bound to support, within the present generation, an evil thought, formed in in- iquity, and hypocritically wearing the garb of religion, has grown into a mighty, mov-ing force, in favor of overstepping, disre-garding, and despising constitutional limi-tations, and trampling under foot the rights of conscience and the liberty of the indi-vidual in the matter of Sabbath-keeping, by demanding the making and enforcement of laws and ordinances compelling the sancti-fication, or alleged sanctification, of the first day of the week as a substitute for the Bible Sabbath; and, when confronted with the objection that such religious laws and partial union of church and state would violate the guaranties of religious liberty of the fundamental law of the land, the advocates of such tyranny and oppression seek to conceal the religious purpose of such laws, and then set up the pretense of " police regulation," by which is meant the right of the government to promote " health and cleanliness," and to " preserve and pro-mote the public welfare, even at the ex-pense of private rights." But, if the cloak of " police power," hypo-critically used, may be stretched and ex-tended to so cover and conceal the true purpose of a religious law, as to admit of a Sabbath or rest-day statute, at all, it can not be contended for a moment, that re-fraining from labor on any certain day of the week is more conducive to the health of saint and sinner than would be a like rest on any other day. When the citizen is compelled by statute or ordinance, to withdraw from his daily vocation, and to rest one day within such number of days as the lawmaking body may designate, for the preservation of his health, all has been done that the most strained construction of " police power " authority can possibly en-join. When the State goes beyond that, and fixes a certain day on which its citizens are required and compelled, under penalty, to rest from their labors, regardless of their
