XIII THIRD QUARTER, 1918 NO. 3 The American People Loyal and Patriotic Under Test By C. S. AMERICAN loyalty and patriotism is now undergoing the severest test in its history Š the renun-ciation of personal political rights in the interests of national security. The most precious boon enjoyed by the American people has been freedom of speech and of the press. This right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution has now been abridged by act of Con-gress for the first time since the passage of the ill-fated Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798, which were practically repu-diated by the people at the next general election. This abridgment was recently accom-plished by the adoption without amend-ment of a bill (H. R. 8753) to amend section 3, title 1, of the act entitled, " An Act to Punish Acts of Interference with the Foreign Relations, the Neutrality, and the Foreign Commerce of the United States, to Punish Espionage, and Better to Enforce the Criminal Laws of the United States and for Other Purposes," . approved June 15, 1917. A rejected amendment introduced by Senator France of Maryland, was as follows : " That nothing in this act shall be construed as limiting the liberty or impairing the right of any individual to publish or speak what is true, with good motives, and justifiable ends." Until now, this right of legitimate criticism wasi enjoyed by every citizen  Longacre in the United States since this country became a nation. During the crisis of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln opposed the enactment of a restrictive bill similar to the Over-man measure. He said he would rather endure and suffer unjust criticism and abuse, if it was given with good motives, than to see the people restricted in their Constitutional prerogatives of exercis-ing the freedom of opinion, of speech, and of the press. President Wilson likewise expressed his disapproval of a proposed section of the Overman bill which aimed to put all the people in the United States into a military zone and under martial law, and subject them to trial by courts-mar-tial instead of by civil courts, for cer-tain offenses. President Wilson put his stamp of disapproval upon this feature of the bill, because in his judgment the measure was unconstitutional and un-necessary. Senator Johnson of California main-tained that the drastic measure (H. R. 8753) would be unconstitutional unless it was safeguarded with special legisla-tion in harmony with Senator France's amendment. When the conference re-port of both Houses struck out this amendment, Senator Johnson said : " You may assert that this particular bill, with its singular adjectives and with its lack
