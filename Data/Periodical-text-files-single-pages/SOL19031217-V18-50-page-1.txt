The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., DECEMBER 17, 1903 NO. 50 Prosecution of Sunday sellers is not Sabbath reform. Sabbath observance belongs in the domain of religion and conscience, not in that of civil law and its enforcement. " Sabbath reform " as carried on by Sunday-enforce-ment clergymen is another name for oppression and persecu-tion. A city is not made and kept Christian by oppression and persecution of its small tradesmen and of poor, aged, and decrepit men and rIvomen. That "protection" of the right to rest which means 8. denial of the right to work and sell the law has no right to gibe and nobody has any right to demand. The people who connot have their Sabbathrtrithout ha'bing other people compelled to obserbe their Sabbath should be left to get along without their Sabbath. The one vital motive and object of the Sunday-law en-forcement crusade in Philadelphia is the maintenance and enforcement of a religious observance.
