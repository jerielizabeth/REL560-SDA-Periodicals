The January Sentinel WHILE it is rather early to make a forecast of the next number of The Sentinel, we can confidently promise that it will be even better than this number. A Suggestive Engraving. First will appear a very suggestive full-page engraving presenting side by side a scene of religious persecution of three centuries ago and one of the pres-ent year, The question beneath it, "Where Is the Difference?" needs no answer, for the engraving with its ac-companying notes convinces the mind at once that in the opening days of the twentieth century some things are possi-ble that differ not a particle in principle from the action of the Massachusetts authorities who, in 1665, fined and im-prisoned Thomas Gould, a Baptist, be-cause he would not have his baby sprinkled and christened. An Important Series of Articles. Another important feature will be an article by A. T. Jones continuing and enlarging upon the thoughts suggested in his article in this number.

On five separate counts, any one of which is sufficient for the pur-pose, Sunday legiAttiovis shown to be incompatible with justice ancrtight. The article is temperate, but logical and con-vincing. Just the article to place before your neighbor who is not sure but what Sunday legislation is all right. The Christian Ideal with Regard to Government. There will be an article entitled "The Christian Ideal of a Civil Government," by M. C. Wilcox, editor of the Signs of the Times, Oakland, Cal. A "Na-tional Conference on the Christian Principles of Civil Government" has just been held at Pittsburg, Pa. This con-ference was attended and addressed by such men as Rev. Henry Collin Minton, D. D., of the San Francisco Theological Seminary, and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church ; Dr. Chas. W. Dabney, president of the State University of Tennessee ; Dr. Chas. A. Blanchard, president of Wheaton Col-lege ; Rev. Sylvester F. Scovel, of Woos-ter University, Wooster, Ohio ; Rev. Herrick Johnson, D.
