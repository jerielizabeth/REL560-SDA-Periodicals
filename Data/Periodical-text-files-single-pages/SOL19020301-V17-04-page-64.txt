Sound Words From a sermon delivered by Minot J. Savage, D.D.. at the Church of the Messiah (Unitarian), New York. November 24, 1001. EVEN if we had absolute divine authority for keeping Sunday, then we would have no right to incorporate this command into civil laws. The world has been fighting for thousands of years for re-ligious liberty; and we say we have attained it. We have, to a certain ex-tent, and within certain limits. If you go back, not a great while, you will find that the Catholic Church, having the power to do it, was ready to use the secular arm even to the extent of imprisonment, torture, and death, to enforce what it believed to be God's commands. We have broken down that. The Catholic Church still believes that these are. God's commands; but it has reluctantly relinquished the exercise of the civil arm in enforcing these com-mands. The Baptist Church believes that God has definitely commanded a par-ticular form of the ordinance of baptism. Does the Baptist Church ask us to enforce that by civil law? No, the Baptist Church is in favor of freedom. It claims that this is true; but it claims that its only right is to persuade people that it is true, and get them to agree with it as the result of argument and persuasion. It does not claim the right to force people to be immersed by the civil power. Why not? Why should not one of God's commands be enforced by the civil arm just as well as any other? Here is the point I wish to make per-fectly clear: Suppose, granted for the moment, that God has commanded everybody everywhere to keep the first day of the week after a particular method. Still, I deny that the state has any authority whatever to enforce (Concluded on page 290)
