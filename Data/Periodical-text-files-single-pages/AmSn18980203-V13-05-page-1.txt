Jar Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it (Entered at the New York Post-office.) IT is better to stand alone on the truth, than with a crowd upon mere opinions. o 444 4 THE patriot is he who strives not to plunge his coun-try into war, but to preserve its peace. HE who invades the rights of but one,individual does that which God himself would not dare to do. • 14  THERE is no surer and quicker way to dishonor Chris-tianity than to try to compel people to observe Sunday, or any other professedly Christian institution. IT requires superhuman wisdom to discern what are the real, vital, all-important issues before the people, at the time when there is time to prepare for them. TRUTH is about as unpopular in the world to-day as it ever was. It is hard work to get people to recognize truth now when it is liable to cost them something to .do it. Is there any more effectual way to oppose wickedness than that in which Jesus Christ opposed it? Should not church people, at least, answer this question in the negative? "ATTENTION to details" is essential in any business, but nowhere more so than in the business of govern- THERE is a great deal going on in the world to-dayŠso much that movements the most dangerous to liberty are able to make their way "in the crowd" almost unob-served. Eternal vigilance was never the price of liberty more truly than just now. IT is easy enough to see now that Jesus Christ had a great mission to this earthŠthe greatest that could be imagined. But how many saw this at the very time when Christ was upon the earth?ŠOnly a few, even of his own disciples. So if you do not see that the SENTINEL has any mission, or if the people generally do not see it, it may still be true that it has one, and a very im-portant one too. War and Civilization. IT is a very significant fact that in all civilized lands to-day there is the greatest activity in pushing forward preparations for war. Whatever other branches of industry are idle, the ef-fects of "hard times" and "over production" are never fat in the great workshops where are forged the nation's implements of destruction. They are usually running "over time." One might imagine that civilization and war went hand in hand, or that war was an instrument Of civiliza-tion, instead of being, as in truth it is, its destroyer. Is civilization now preparing to commit suicide? All Europe is an armed camp; and now the war agi-tation has involved the heathen countries of the far East, and extends its dark shadow across the water, so that it covers the nations of both hemispheres; and we are com-pelled to face the prospect of a general war, which will inflict a blow upon civilization that will sweep away at once the fruits of centuries.
