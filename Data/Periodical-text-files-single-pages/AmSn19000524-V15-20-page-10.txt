Of course it goes without saying that only, a small proportion of those who are called Christians are such in reality, since in such an enumeration as this the en-tire population of such countries as the United States and England is counted as Christian. Southern Correspondence. SUNDAY LAW AGITATION IN LOUISIANA. The legislature of Louisiana is now in session at Baton Rouge, and before the session of sixty days closes a campaign will have been carried on before it for and against the repeal of the present Sunday law. Ever since its passage in the legislative session of 1886, repeated attempts have been made to repeal or amend the law, but thus far without success. It is practically a dead letter, and this is offered by some as a reason demanding a change; while others object to it as be-ing class legislation. The law is certainly a unique contribution to legislative jurisprudence because of two main features which will appear evident upon a careful reading of its provisions : "No. 18, Sec. 1. That from and after the thirty-first day of December, A. D. 1886, all stores, shops, saloons, and all places of public business which are or may be licensed under the law of the State of Louisiana, or under any parochial or municipl law or ordinance, and all plantation stores, are hereby required to be closed at twelve o'clock on Saturday nights, and to remain closed continuously for twenty-four (24) hours, during which period of time it shall not be lawful for the pro-prietors thereof to give, trade, barter, exchange or sell any of the stock or any article of merchandise kept in any such establishment. "Sec. 2. That whosoever shall violate the provisions of this act, for each offense shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on trial and conviction, shall pay a fine of not less than $25, nor more than $250, or be imprisoned for not less than ten days nor more than thirty days, or both, at the discretion of the court. Provisions of this act shall not apply to newsdealers, keepers of soda fountains, places of resort for health and recreation, watering places and public parks, nor prevent the sale of ice. "Sec. 3. That the provisions of this act shall not apply to newspaper offices, printing offices, book stores, drug stores, apothecary shops, undertaking shops, public and private markets, bakeries, dairies, livery stables, railroads whether steam or horse, hotels, boarding houses, steamboats and other vessels, ware-houses for receiving and forwarding freights, restau-rants, telegraph offices and theaters, or any place of amusement, providing no intoxicating liquors are sold on the premises; provided, that stores may be opened  for the purpose of selling anything necessary in sick-ness and for burial purposes ; provided that nothing in this act shall be construed so as to allow hotels or boarding houses to sell or dispose of alcoholic liquors, except wine for table use, on Sundays ; and provided, further, that no alcoholic, vinous, or malt liquor shall be given, traded or bartered or sold or delivered in any public place on Sunday, except when actually adminis-tered or prescribed by a practicing physician in the discharge of his professional duty in case of sickness ; in such case the physicians administering the intoxi-cating liquors may be charged therefor. "Sec. 4. That all laws or parts of laws contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions hereof, be and the same are hereby repealed." It will be observed that there is no allusion to mat-ters religious on the face of the law, revealing clever-ness in the use of names and terms by its author. But of course the law is on the statute book of Louisiana in deference to the prevailing religious sentiment. The other feature is the provisions of the law ex-empting so many lines of business from its prohibi-tion. On its face these exemptions would seem to serve as licensing some lines of business on one day of the week to the detriment and loss of other lines of business which are legitimate on other days of the week. Of course the religious people who are interested in the Sunday institution are "up in arms" about it, particularly in New Orleans, where a Sunday Rest League is bending its energies to keep the law upon the statute books. At a recent meeting of the League a memorial to the legislature was prepared, and in urging its adoption one speaker said that he had been told by a sugar planter that in the height of the grind-ing season he "ceased operations on the seventh day, because even the leather belts would disintegrate if they did not get a period of rest." Another said : "The same may be said of the hardest steel. Every man who shaved himself knew that his razor needed rest, and every mechanic knew that car wheels would dis-integrate if they did not get a period of rest." A doctor said rest was necessary for the human system, and referred to the fact that in 1853 over 600 English phy-sicians had memorialized parliament, saying one day's rest in seven was essential for the physical man. One speaker quoted Cardinal Gibbons, who says of the weekly rest day : "It contributes immeasurably to the restriction of vice and immorality, and the pro-,  motion of peace and social order." It goes withou't saying that rest is necessary for spiritual and physical reasons. This was known by the very first man Adam, for "the Sabbath was made for the man." But the great question raised by this.whole
