Zt A.N11E111140.A.N VoL. 9, No. 9. NEW YORK, MARCH 1, 1894. ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some Mend, Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE National Reformers are preparing to deluge Congress with petitions for the adoption of the proposed " Christian " amendment to the Constitution. IT is stated that Archbishop Kain, of St. Louis, has created some gossip by instructing priests to prepare for their first communion children of Roman Cath-olic faith who attend public schools. Some of the priests have heretofore refused to do this. DON'T fail to note in the leader this week the utterance of " Father " Sherman, given out through mistake by the priest himself. This utterance is not the less significant because made public by mis-take; indeed that fact makes it rather more significant. THE Independent thinks it very proper that a Catholic should be elected to the vacancy on the Board of Regents of this State caused by the death of Bishop Mc-Neirney. Then if a Methodist should die of course another Methodist would have to be chosen, etc. So in time a religious qualification would come to attach to the office with almost the force of statute law. FEBRUARY 15, Senator Gallinger, of New Hampshire, Henry W. Blair's suc-cessor, introduced in the United States Senate, by request, " a bill to protect the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, as a day of rest and worship in the District of Columbia." The bill was read twice by its title, and referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. We print the bill on another page. " PROTESTANTS themselves," says the Catholic Review, " acknowledge that the Catholic religion has a powerfully re-straining influence upon the masses. It has a tendency to make them good, moral citizens." Protestants acknowledge noth-ing of the sort. That very many Cath-olics are good citizens is freely granted; but it is not their religion that makes them such. The facts of history are against the claim that popery is a great moral force. Superstition never elevates. FEBRUARY 19, the President nominated Senator Edward Douglass White, of Louisiana, as Supreme Court Justice. Judge White is a Roman Catholic. He was born in the parish of Lafourche, Louisiana, in November, 1845; was edu-cated at Mount St. Mary's, near Emmits-burg, Md., at the Jesuit College in New  Orleans and at Georgetown College, Dis-trict of Columbia; served in the confed-erate army; was licensed to practice law by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in December, 1868; elected State Senator in 1874; was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in 1878; was elected to the United States Senate in 1891. The nomination was immediately confirmed. THE Fish Commission of this State has "heartily indorsed" a bill before the leg-islature permitting Sunday fishing in Kings, Queens, Richmond, and Suffolk Counties. THE Northwestern Chronicle (Roman Catholic) thinks the "present agitation carried on by the secret society commonly known as the American Protective Asso-ciation " affords " an opportunity to Cath-olics to prove the real teachings of Catho-lic belief and the real facts of history and thus clear up many misconceptions in the popular mind." Then why not let the facts of history alone, instead of suppres-sing them as the Catholics try to do ? THE Independent which, although re-peatedly invited by Catholic papers to at-tend to its own affairs and let " things Roman" alone, is still volunteering "in-side" information to the American hi-erarchy. In its issue of the 22nd ult., it ventures the opinion that " the apostolic delegate Satolli has nearly concluded the period during which it was supposed that his services in this country would be re-quired, and that he will receive before long the honor of a cardinalate and be re-called." Ł THE Catholic Mirror of the 17th inst., has an editorial on " The Pope as Inter-national Arbitrator." It says :Š The pope, if selected by all, would exert the author-ity thus vested in him by virtue of the assent of the nations, and the nature of the authority would be civil, the exercise of which would commit no one to papal supremacy or to ecclesiastical doctrines based upon it. . . . The day is not far distant when nations will adopt this method of settling their differ-ences, It seems very likely that this will be so; for " all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." " AN attempt is to be made at Albany," says the Independent, " to legislate away indirectly our Sunday." The Independent does not mean that the period of twenty-four hours known as Sunday is to be abolished, but simply that the legislature contemplates some changes in the excise law. We have no sympathy with the proposed legislation, but what a sorry in-stitution it is that is dependent on the New York legislature for its very existence. " Legislate away indirectly our Sunday," indeed I and the Independent professes to believe that it is a divine institution. How then can the legislature of New York, or of any other State, legislate it away ? THE " Rev." Sam Small, a whilom de-nouncer of Sunday papers is now, it seems, himself publishing a paper down in Okla-homa, which is issued on Sunday as on other days. Mr. Small is evidently like the rest of the Sunday law advocatesŠhe wants law for the other fellow, and does not intend that it shall interfere with his busi-ness; and when his business is preaching he doe,s not mean that any other business shall interfere with the size of his congre- gation if he can help it, or if law' can con-trol the matter. In short Mr. Small when preaching wants a monopoly of one day in the week for that business, and when running a newspaper he means to have a least an equal chance on Sunday with other publishers. Mr. Small is certainly very practical, whatever may be said of his piety. ELDER W. A. MCCU TCHEN and Prof. Elmer C. Keck, the Seventh-day Advent-ist minister and teacher arrested for Sun-day work in Gainesville, Ga., were tried on the 22nd ult. As this paper was closing up, a telegram informed us that the jury was still out and that a verdict was not expected until the next day. This would seem to give some hope of an acquittal, or at least a disagreement. But really under the Georgia law there seems to be little room for either, as the fact of the work is not denied. Adventists maintain their right to work on Sunday, having, how-ever, due regard to the Golden Rule, and avoiding all work that in the nature of the case would be a real annoyance to those who desire quiet on Sunday. For instance, in building a church in Jersey City, N. J., recently, work was suspended on Sunday until the building was inclosed and there was inside work that could be done with-out really disturbing anybody; then work was carried on on Sunday as on other days.
