86 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.. Is It Not Church and State? THE following editorial from the Catholic Mir-ror of February 16 no doubt expresses the senti-anents of Catholics as well as of those Protestants who are clamoring for religious legislation:Š "The Catholics of this country are decidedly opposed to a union of Church and State. That is the reason they object to the arrogant attempt of Protestants to mould the social and educational life of the country on sectarian lines. It is all very well for the sects to divert public attention from their own plans by raising a hue and cry about the tendency of the Catholic Church to gobble up every-thing, but the attempt is too thin. Its transpar-ency is becoming more apparent every day to rea-sonable minds outside of the church." But what is this "union of Church and State" to which Catholics are opposed? It is revealed in the second sentence. They object to the mould-ing of "the social and educational life of the coun-try on sectarian lines;" that is, they object to making any denomination the State churchŠunless (for history past and present proves the fact) the State church is the Roman Catholic. Of course, they know that there is no present prospect of that church becoming the State church ; therefore they can pose as liberalists, and talk of freedom of conscience. But Spain and Ecuador and Mexico prove that Rome does desire a union of the Catholic Church and State. And no sect is wielding a more powerful influence in politics to-day than that of Rome. Her liberal utterances are but blinds to her eternally-sought object,Šthe control of all power, and the extermination of all heretics. Many Protestants are standing just where Rome does. If Reformed Presbyterians could rea-sonably hope that their church could be made the State church, is it to be considered a moment that they would not labor earnestly for that object? Would it not likewise be the same with the gi<eater part of the Lutheran and Protestant Episcopal Churches? The course pursued by these churches on the Continent and in England proves that they would zealously labor to make their church the State church. But neither these, nor any other Protestant de-nomination, hope for anything of this kind. It can be safely said that no one denomination will ever become the State church of our Federal Gov-ernment. Knowing this, these political Protest-ants say with Roman Catholics, We do not believe in a union of Church and State. But by this they always mean a union of one church; or de-nomination, with the State. But what do they believe? They believe (and are working for that purpose) in uniting the various so-called branches of the Christian church, by which they mean the great and popular bodies of Christendom, on doc-trines which are considered essential and common to all. These essential doctrines will be, in their minds, the essentials of Christianity, or the Chris-tian religion, and these churches which hold to, and unite upon, these essentials will be held by these bodies to constitute the Christian church. By their united power and influence they can mould politics at their will. These essentials will become embodied in statute law, and thus will be formed the union of the so-called Christian church and StateŠjust as much a union of Church and State as though it was one church connected with the State, and a thousand times more productive of evil, because more powerful. But such a combi-nation would never be productive of good; for Christianity never needed the aid of State laws ; they have always proved a curse to her pure and holy doctrines. M. C. W. The Abiding Sabbath and the Lord's Day THE 5500 AND a1,000 PRIZE ESSAYS. A. REVIEVST. -  The above is the title of a pamphlet recently issued. In its pages the author reviews the two most recent and without doubt the best contributions to the defense of Sunday, popularly called the " Lord's Day." The first of these essays was written by Rev. George Elliott, and took the $500 " Fletcher Prize," offered by the trustees of Dartmouth College for the best es-say on the " Perpetual Obligalion of the Lord's Day." The other essay was written by A. E. Waffle, M. A., and was awarded a $1,000 prize by the Committee of Publication of the American Sunday-school Union. We state thus definitely the source of the essays reviewed that all may see their impor-tance. Certainly if there was any argument in favor f Sunday, we should expect to find it in these prize essays. Elder Jones in his Review tak s up their arguments and assertions, and shows very plainly how several times the authors ave proved what they did not want to prove at allŠnamely: The Seventh-day Sabbath is s ill as binding on all as when the law was given. This Review will be read with interest and profit b all, and those who have friends that are interested in the Sabbath Question should see tha one of these pamphlets is placed in their hands. WORDS OF APPRO ATION. Elder R. A. Underwood, President Ohio Conference, say :Š "The ' Abiding Sabbath' should find its way to every h me in the land. It certainly will have a wide circulation, May God bless it on its mission. The quotations from Mr. Elliott's essays set forth the  divine origin of the Sabbath, its object, universality, and inseparable relation to the moral law of ten com-mandments, of which it is a part, and its binding obligation upon all mankind ; also the clear distinction between the Sabbath and the ceremonial rites, or laws, in words of sublime, convincing power. Yet he, like all who feel it their duty to prop up the Sunday-sabbath with the fourth commandment, contrad.  is his own position. Elder Jones has made a clean-cut, sound argument." Elder J. N. Loughborough, President California Conference, says "I have just completed a careful reading of Elder Jones' Review. In this he attacks the main pillars of their argument for a Sunday-sabbath, and at the same time he gives an epitome of the argument for the true Bible Sabbath. He shows clearly that notwithstanding all the efforts of the $50o and $1,000 essay men to establish Sunday as the Sabbath, it stands, according to their own admissions, without any Scripture command, or any divine warrant. This Review clearly shows what is the true 'Abiding Sabbath,' the day of God's own appointment. This book of Elder Jones' should have a very wide circulation, and be read by all." 176 pages, price, postpaid, 20 Cents. Address orders to PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. "'fathers 10 Catholic Church," .1 <s  Š4.53n Eta. 3. 'iliaggon*r.+- 0+0 *iic> a*- iN HISTORY *REPEAT'S Ł ITSELF,k.: Because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence he who would know how to avoid error in the future must know how errors have developed in the past. The "FATHERS or THE CATHOLIC CHURCH" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient hea-then philosophy, which was largely responsible for the immorality of that time, and shows how the adop-tion of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity to accommodate the heathen element, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of Paganism. It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on Š4.1ittn* r  orship*ana * Sunbag.Š Is alone worth the price of the book. The chapter on "The Apostolic Church" consists largely of quotations from Scripture, showing that grave errors both of faith and practice existed in the church even in the days of the apostles, so that the early existence of a practice proves nothing as to its correctness. Then a chapter is devoted to each of the Fathers, and to his writings. The Sunday argument, so far as it is drawn from the Fathers, is completely demolished by the citation of other testimony from them in favor of some of the grossest evils of the Catholic Church. Lastly, several chapters are devoted to "The Great Apostasy," in which are traced the logical results of the teachings of the Fathers. ook*- As As all are constantly meeting quotations from the Fathers in behalf of Sunday. In these cases it is only necessary to show that the same Fathers believed in purgatory and prayers for the dead, to nullify their testimony. The book is printed on fine tinted paper, neatly bound in cloth, with gilt side stamp, and contains 392 pages. Price, Post Paid, $1.00.
