AMETZICAN SENTINEL. 349 workers, etc., are beginning to swarm over the earth. False prophets will tell the people that a millennium of peace and plenty is just beyond these terrible troubles, and that the silencing and subjection of those who break the Sunday law, is the only thing that stands in the way of its realization. Then the emnity of the world will focus on God's commandment-keeping people. You may read Rev. 12:17." `And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.'" "The people of God will be tried as by fire. Daniel says, 'Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand."' "But, mama, I thought you said they would be de-livered." "So they will, my boy. They will be tried; but not destroyed. Satan would delight to have Christ come, and find no living witness; but the martyrs of the past suffice to show his purpose, and so in the very midst of falling plagues, of war, pestilence, famine, and the general upheaval of earthly things, the heavens will depart 'as a scroll when it is rolled together,' and the King of kings will appear in awful majesty, with all his holy angels. Then the righteous dead will be raised, and the living children of God will be 'caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.' A happy day will this be for those whose names are found written in the Book of Life; for they are the ones that shall be delivered out of the time of trouble such as never was." F. B. A Card. To all interested in carrying the gospel of Jesus Christ to the inhabitants of other lands and who desire to assist in supporting missionaries already placed and others who may engage in the work, the opportunity is given to make an offering to the Foreign Mission Board of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. Such donations should be sent to W. H. Edwards, the Treasurer of the Board, 1730 North Fifteenth Street, Philadelphia, Pa. New Tracts.
