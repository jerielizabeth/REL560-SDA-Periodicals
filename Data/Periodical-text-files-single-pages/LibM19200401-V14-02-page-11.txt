LIBERTY 41 The Pastors' Federation of W ashing-ton, and the Lord's Day Alliance of the United States, demand that Congress shall enact a law for " the proper ob-servance of Sunday in the District of Columbia." Indeed, such a bill has been introduced. But is the United States Congress to decide what is " proper " Sunday observance If so, will its decision be along Roman Catholic or along Protestant lines ? Will Con-gress indorse Sunday baseball and other " play," or will it put the ban on all " play " ? If Congress undertakes to regulate Sunday observance in the District of Columbia, or anywhere else, trouble will inevitably follow, for Christians, millions of them, are not agreed as to what is " proper " Sunday observance. They are not agreed even as to whether Sunday should be observed at all or not. The Quaker and many other small sects of Christians do not believe there is any difference in days. Seventh-day Bap-tists and Seventh-day Adventists and Jews have no regard whatever for Sun- day above Monday, or Tuesday, or any other day of the week. Sunday an Institution of Religion " Congress shall make no law respect-ing an establishment of religion, or pro-hibiting the free exercise thereof." ŠFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution. Sunday is a religious institution ; it had its origin in religion ; it is main-tained by religion. Put the Sunday on the same plane with the Fourth of July and other holidays, allowing each per-son to observe the day according to his conscience, and all will be well. If a man desires to worship on that day, by all means let him worship ; if he desires to work, let him work ; if he wishes to spend the day in God's outdoors or at a place of amusement, this is his right under the United States Constitution ; it is a right given him by his Creator. " Keep the church and the state forever separate," and God will continue to bless the land of liberty as he ever has in the days that are past. 111111111111M11111111111111111111110111R11111111111111111111111110111111111111111111113011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111I1111111111E11111171111111M111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111M A Great Religious Trust and One of Its Chief Objects NI—,—imn,,,ii,,,,,,,D,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,m,,,,,,,,.................ii.........m.i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,m,,mim,ffim, 11111111111111,111111,111,11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 By the Editor 11111111111111011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 rrWENTY-TWO Protestant denorai- 1 nations sent their delegates to the Interchurch Council held February 4-6 inclusive, in Witherspoon Hall, Phila-delphia. The meeting was for the pur-pose of forming an organic union of the " Evangelical Churches in America." But most of the " delegates " stated that they could not speak authoritatively for their denominations and would have to refer the question of organic union to their general governing bodies. So they organized merely a " federal union "  under the name, " The United Churches of Christ in America." This new organization then created a supreme council having executive pow-ers, which, as stated, " will play the part of a Marshal Foch " in directing the operations of all the churches in their missionary activities, in educational and inspirational work in the fields of evan-gelism, social service, and religious edu-cation. A great deal of stress was laid upon " social service and moral evolution."
