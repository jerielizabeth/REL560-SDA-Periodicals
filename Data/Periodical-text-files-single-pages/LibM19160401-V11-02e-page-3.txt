 LIBERTY "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.-  Leo. 25 : 10.                   Vol.. XI SECOND QUARTER, 1916 Š EXTRA No. 4         Explanatory Note THIS Extra on Free Press, Free Speech, Free Church, deals with a re-cent drastic press bill introduced into the House of Representatives by Hon. James A. Gallivan, of Boston, Mass. The measure, if enacted into law, would em-power the Postmaster-General to shut out of the mails any publication which might attack any religion or any religious order to which any citizen of the United States might belong. It would establish a one-man censorship of the press, with un-limited possibilities for evil. The Extra also deals with a very im-portant religious bill, which aims to make "the proper observance " of Sunday compulsory in the District of Columbia. This religious measure was recently in-troduced in the Senate by Senator Jones of the State of Washington. Prompt action is needed from the field in order to induce Congress to defer ac-tion upon these measures ; and since the LIBERTY magazine for the third quarter of 1916 does not come from the press in time to meet the present emergency, we are issuing this Extra to meet the situation. Every lover of freedom should help to give this Extra as extensive a cir-culation as possible. If these bills were to be enacted into law, they would destroy the freedom of  the press and of speech, and would com-mit Congress fully to the policy of reli-gious legislation. The floodgates would be opened, and a deluge of restrictive religious measures would be certain to follow. The organizations which are sup-porting these bills, according to the peti-tions listed in the Congressional Record, are mostly religious. We cannot accept a governmental censorship of the press. nor any legal establishment of religion, without vigorous, determined, and most persistent protest. Do not fail to read the Extra through from cover to cover. The information contained therein is invaluable, and the arguments unanswerable. Just now, be-fore Congress adjourns, there is danger of due consideration not being given to certain bills during the rush of business in the closing days of this session. You are urged therefore to get at once all the signatures possible to the petitions which appear on the last two pages of the Ex-tra, and forward to your Senators and Representatives in Congress the petition blanks, properly filled out. Do not delay a single day. The price of this Extra is $1 a hun-dred, or $8 a thousand; single copies, 5 cents. Address Liberty Magazine, Ta-koma Park Station, Washington, D. C. The United States as a nation is not a religious nation, it is not a Christian nation, it is not a Catholic nation, it is not a Protestant nation; it is a secular nation. With clear eye and deliberate purpose, it refused to have anything to do with the establish-ment of anybody's religion.Š Rev. Minot J. Savage. Its
