The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., OCTOBER 15, 1903 NO. 41 There have been two sorts of Sunday-observance laws one posittve and the other negative. The one commanded church attendance and the partaking of the sacraments; Ivhile the other merely forbids you to do so-and-so. We have, of course, left far behind us those affirmative laws; and strangely enough the most rigorous of the Sabbatarians now agree that they <were bad laws. Progress, however, is slolv, and the Sabbatarians still hold to it that negative lalvs are perfectly right. "If Ive can't make you go to church, 'we shall at all events prevent your going anylvhere else, or amusing yourself if you get there," is their position. BUT THE NEGATIVE LAWS ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD ONES. So far as they are an attempt to enforce theological opinion they are wrong. . . . You believe that people Ivould be much better off in churches than in parks on Sunday. But have you a right to impose your vielvs upon others? If you have, why honestly go and do it. But if you have not, are you justified in slanting your legis-lation so as surreptitiously and indirectly to accomplish your improper purpose? Better be honest with yourselves and fair to others.Å Hon. john S. Ewart, K. C., at a meeting to consider The Sun- day Question" in St. George's Church, Winnipeg, Manitoba, November 9, 1902.
