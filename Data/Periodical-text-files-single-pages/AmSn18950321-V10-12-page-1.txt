BALLENGER, MORE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN TENNESSEE. Seventh-day Adventist Academy at Graysville Closed by Religious Intolerance. Tx 1892; Prof. G. W. Colcord, a Seventh-day Adventist minister, established an acad-emy at Graysville, Rhea County, Tenn. He invested in this school all the money he had, amounting to several thousand dollars. Several of his brethren likewise invested money in the enterprise, not as a speculation nor with the, expectation of any financial re-turn, but for the purpose of building up a school that would afford young people in that part of the country an opportunity to acquire a good education and thus fit them for useful-ness in the world. Elder Colcord associated with him in this work, his wife and his nephew and wife,who gave their time to the wort, receiving only a very limited remuneration. The school pros-pered, and when it closed a few days since, had an enrollment of over one hundred stu-dents. A number of Adventist families from dif-ferent parts of the State and from neighbor-ing States, moved to Graysville in order that they might educate their children at this academy. Pleasant homes were established and the village soon wore an air of prosperity to which it had, long been a stranger. Every-thing moved along pleasantly until the fall of 1894, when some persons, probably envious of the prosperity of the Adventists, invoked the Tennessee Sunday law against them and se-cured the indictment of fourteen members of the Graysville Church, including Elder G. W. Colcord, Prof. I. C. Colcord, his nephew, and M. C. Sturdevant, manager of the boys' dor-mitory. These indictments were found at the instigation of a man who had moved into the  neighborhood and who had taken offense be-cause one of the Adventists who kept a gro-cery had refused to sell him goods on credit. The attorney-general, be it said to his credit, used his influence to prevent this action, but without avail, and in due course the indict-ments were docketed for trial at the March term of court, which just closed at Dayton. Three of the indicted Adventists were ab-sent from the neighborhood and were not arrested. One asked to have his case continued until another term of court, and his request was granted. Nine ap-peared for trial. The cases were taken up March 5. The defend-ants employed no counsel, each one making a brief statement to the court and jury, of which the following are samples :Š Wm. Burchard's Defense Before the Court' and Jury,. I would just like to say that I am indicted for Vio-lating the Sabbath. I plead not guilty. I have been keeping the seventh day for four and one half years. I have found out that the Bible says that, the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath. I obey the laws of,  the land, but when they conflict with the laws of God I obey the laws of God ; and when they do not, I obey the laws of the State. The Bible says, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stran-ger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." The State says the first day of the week is the Sabbath. God created the heavens and the earth, and when other gods contravene, I obey the God of EDITORS. - ASSISTANT EDITOR. THE CLOSED ACADEMY. We are not, or should not be, Hying in an age of religious persecution. Yet eight of our best citizens are being kept in the county jail, because as Seventh-day Adventists they conscientiously violated a bad law, that says they MUST observe the first day of the week as the Sabbath instead of the seventh. A GOOD COMMUNITY HAS BEEN DISORGANIZED; A SPLENDID SCHOOL, THAT HAS BEEN DIFFUSING THE RAYS OF KNOWLEDGE AMONG THE PEOPLE, HAS BEEN BROKEN UP. The remedy is M change the law; and do it as quickly as possible.ŠDayton (Tenn.) Republican, March 9.
