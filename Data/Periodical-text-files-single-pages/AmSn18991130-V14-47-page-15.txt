All you have to do to fill the "Post" is to dip the nib into the ink bottle, draw out the plunger, and the pen is ready for use. Cleaning the "Post." It can be done in five , seconds. Dip the pen in a glass of water and work the plunger backward and for-ward a few times. The prominent men and women whose testimonials are given herewith witness to the merits of the "Post." 4 4 4 General Lew Wallace, Author of "Ben Hur," says: "I have tried every pen of the kind on the market, and now unhesitatingly give the preference to the Post. It not only feeds itself with less care, but has the immeasurable advantage of re-supply without inking the fingers. I do all my work with it." Dr. Josiah Strong, than whom few men are better known in America, says: "A perfect fountain pen at lastl I have hunted for it upwards of twenty years. I have tried many, and I can as-sure you they have tried me. I have had little satisfaction even from the best, but the Post leaves nothing to be desired. I am de-lighted with it." Dr. Lyman Abbott, editor of "The Outlook," and until re-cently pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, N. Y., says: "To me It is a great advantage to have a fountain pen which requires no filler and can be filled at any time, and at any inkstand, without the possibility of inky fingers or blotted paper or desk." Ł lion. Alva Adams, Governor of Colorado, writes: "The Post pen is an ideal fountain pen. . . . It requires little more trouble to replenish than to dip an ordinary pen in an inkstand." Commander Booth Tucker says: "I have used fountain pens for the last ten years, almost every description, and have no hesi-tation in saying in my opinion the Post is the best." Ira D. Sankey, the world's great singing evangelist, writes: "I have used the Post pen for some time and have had great satis-faction with its use. It never fails or gets cranky. One can at least have clean hands by using the Post, *whatever the heart may be." Hon. Luther Laflin Pulls, Chicago's celebrated criminal law-yer, writes:. "Your Post Fountain Pen is the best I have ever used Šsimple, reliable, durableŠand I thank you for having brought it to my notice." 4 4 4 4 Ł The price of the "Post" is $3.00.
