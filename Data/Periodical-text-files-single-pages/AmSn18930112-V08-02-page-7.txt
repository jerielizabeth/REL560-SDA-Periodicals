I have had a Munson typewriter in constant use for over a year, and consider it in many respects, the best typewriter in the market. It is small, light and compact. It is as handsome as a watch, and looks more like an ornament than a thing of use. The Munson will do anything that any other will do, and as quickly and well, if not quicker and better. J. A. WALDRON, Prank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, New York City. After a year's use of the Munson typewriter, I heartily pronounce it as being unexcelled by any machine in the market. In the direction of clearness and beauty of type, and alignment, it is without a rival. L. J. LIVELY, Manager, D. Appleton & Co., Chicago. The Munson is certainly the equal of any machine for speed and general efficiency as an office machine; and when it comes to traveling there is nothing like it. DR. E. J. WAGGONER, London, England. Ł I like the Munson machine very much. It is doing me good service, and I can recommend it to all who want a typewriter. O. A. OLsnx, Pres. S. D. A. Gen. Conf., Battle Creek, Mich. I would not exchange my Munson typewriter for any typewriter on the market. L. C. CHADWICK, Pres. I. T. & M. Soc., Bridgtown, Barbadoes. Address, The Munson Typewriter Co., Or, A. F.

It is not only unsolicited and un-appreciated but they actually repel it, knowing that it is more "theological than humanitarian," and that it is regarded by these theologians merely as " the finest possible investment " which will " soon return with fine rates of interest." It will be some time before this " sham " sympathy for the working-man will succeed in deceiving him into selling his liberties to ecclesiastical corpora-tions. To adopt the idea of another: You can fool some of the workingmen all the time, and all the workingmen some of the time, but the time has not yet come when you can fool all the working-men all of the time. And now allow me in closing to advise you to cease wasting sympathy on the workingman. He does not need it, and does not ask it, and much prefers to interpret his rights for himself, and adopt his own measures for securing them. If you were to take your Bible and convince the workingmen that Sunday is the Sabbath, and with the gospel of Jesus Christ quicken his con-science, you would not need to be agitating for a law to compel him to assert his right, which he al-ready possesses, to a day of rest and worship; he would do this for himself, and, like the Seventh-day Adventists of Henry County, Tenn., would go to prison and the chain-gang rather than violate his conscience. But the secret of the whole sittia-tion is in the fact that there is no Bible authority for Sunday observance, and the laboring man knows there is none, and the Sunday law advo-cates confess there is none when they appeal to the civil government to enact a law to supply the lack of such authority. The more you investigate this question the more will you discover that you are enlisted on the " sham " side of the controversy. That you may investigate and early arrive at the real truth of the matter; is the hope of Your friend, A. F. BALLENGER. The Grand Trunk Railway OF CANADA AND THE Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway Form the GREAT THROUGH LINE to all Points in the West, AND OFFER TO THE TRAVELING PUBLIC THE ADVANTAGE OF THROUGH TRAINS WITHOUT TRANSFER, AND -A VIEW OF THE ST. CLAIR TUNNEL, "THE LINE THAT BINDS TWO GREAT NATIONS." It is the greatest submarine tunnel in the world, extending from Port Huron, Mich., under the St. Clair River to Sarnia, Ontario, and connecting the Grand Trunk Railway System of Canada with the Chicago & Grand Trunk Railway. It has just been completed at a cost of $2,700,000. The tunnel proper is a continuous iron tube, nineteen feet and ten inches in diameter, and 6025 feet, or more than a mile, long. The length of the approaches, in addition to the tunnel proper, is 5603 feet, making all told a little over two miles. Trains of the Grand Trunk and Chicago & Grand Trunk Railways are hauled through this tunnel by engines specially constructed for the purpose. They are said to be the largest engines in the world. The entire weight of the engine and tender rests upon ten drive-wheels. The weight of one of these monster engines in actual service is found to be approx-imately one hundred tons. N. J. POWER, W. E.
