They are surely infidels, who say, Verily God is Christ, the son of Mary.Š Koran, chap. 6. 2. 0 true believers, take not the Jews or Chris-tians for your friends; they are friends the one to the otherŁ'  but whoso among you taketh them for his friends, he is surely one of them.Š Ib. 3. War is enjoined you against the infidels; bin this is hateful unto you; yet perchance ye hate a thing which is better for you, and perchance you love a thing which is worse for you; but God knoweth, and ye know not.Š Id., chap. 2. 4. Fight therefore against them, until there be no temptation to idolatry, and the religion be God's.Š Ib. 5. Fight against the friends of Satan, for the stratagem of Satan is weak.Š Id., chap. 4. 6. And when the months wherein ye are DOI allowed to attack them shall be past, kill the idol-aters wheresoever ye shall find them, and take them prisoners, and besiege them, and lay wait for them in every convenient place.Š Id., chap. 9. 7. When ye encounter the unbellevers, strike off their heads, until ye have made a great slaughter among them.Š Id., chap. 47. 8. Ye are also forbidden to take to wife free women who are married, except those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves. This is ordained you from God.Š Id., chap. 4. And still there are some people in America who are clamoring for the es-tablishment of a national religion. In the October issue of the Christian States-man we read: " The most important mat-ter of all is the matter of national reli-gion."Š Page 405. And again, " The principles of national religion furnish the only true solution of each of these prob-lems."Š Page 409. The Statesman did not attempt to har-monize its statement or its policy with the facts as they appear in the present war situation. If the establishment of national religion in this country would prevent future trouble and war, why did not the establishments of national reli-gions prevent England, Belgium, Ger-many, Austria, Serbia, Italy, Bulgaria, Russia, and Turkey from going to war? All the countries mentioned have a le-gally established national religion, and, with the single exception of Turkey, it is the Christian religion. The worst atrocities that ever have been perpetrated upon mankind have been committed in the name of national religion. The his-tory of the past has demonstrated the in- 42 disputable fact that it makes no differ-ence which religion is established as the national religion, whether it be Protes-tant, Catholic, Mohammedan, or heathen; each, when it has sat on the throne of civil power, has persecuted the dissenter and nonconformist unto death, and has aimed to give him no rest in heaven. earth, or hell. c. S. L.  tVfffi t* Are Sunday Laws Religious ? THIS question was raised some yearn ago before a committee of Congress in this city. and Rev. W. F. Crafts, then as now a prominent Sunday law advo-cate, said: Š A weekly day of rest has never been perma-nently secured in any laud except on the basis of religious obligation. Take the religion out and you take the rest out.Š Senate Miscel-laneous Documents, No. 43, page 21 (Fiftieth Congress, Second Session, Dec. 13, 1888). Then Mr. Crafts and others who are asking for a Sunday law for the Dis-trict of Columbia are either asking for a vain thing or are demanding the legal establishment of a religious rest, a reli-gious observance of a religious day.
