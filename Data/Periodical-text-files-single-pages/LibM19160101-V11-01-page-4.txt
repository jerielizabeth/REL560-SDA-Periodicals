The present Congress is not the first to be urged to enact laws of this character. In the 20th and I  21st Congresses the subject of Sunday observance was considered from every viewpoint, and it was decided by ithe statesmen of that day that the whole question be- /longed to the realm of religion, and that Congress could not determine for any citizen the duty of regarding one day above another. That this was the attitude of the fathers of our country may be drawn from the following excerpt from House Report on Sunday Mails, communi-cated March 4 and 5, 1830: Š It is perhaps fortunate for our country that the propo-sition [to enact Sunday legislation] should have been IImade at this early period while the spirit of the Revolu-tion yet exists in full vigor.Š " American State Papers," Class VII, page 229. Congress has uniformly decided against legislation of this character, regarding it as violative of that part of the I First Amendment which provides that Š Congress shall make no law respecting an establish-ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. We request, therefore, that the present Congress ad-here strictly to the precedents of the past on this subject, and that our liberties be as jealously guarded by our national legislators during Iwere by the lawmakers of three quarters of a century ago. / Most obediently, / Dec.
