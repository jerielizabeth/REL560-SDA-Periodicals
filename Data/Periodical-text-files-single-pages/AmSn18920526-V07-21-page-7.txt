It is remarkable how impossible it is for this question to attain to an acettrate statement in the public prints, In the first place, thbad Who are petitioning that congress should take no action to close the World's Fair oh Sunday are not striving to eta& anybody in point of numbers. That, certainly, is not necessary it a matter of principle, and they are simply striving to call the attention of Congress to the fact that there is a vital principle involved in this question: This is a subject in which majorities do not properly rule. Again, these different parties are not arrayed strictly " for and against these propositions," as the Post says. One party is petitioning for nositive action closing the Fair. The other party is not asking for positive action requiring it to be open, they would protest against that as earnestly as against the present proposition. The opposition is only petitioning that the Government remain neu-tral, where, of right and propriety it ought to be neutral, that and nothing more. And again, as to the sale of liquor, this the petitions of the opposition do not touch. While the majority of them comprehend, no doubt that this is a matter properly under the jurisdiction of the local management and the law of the place, yet the unqualified view of almost the entire body, of those now petitioning Congress not to take any action on Sunday closing, sts that the manufacture and sale of liquor should be done away entirely, always and everywhere. Ł Signed by Chicago Lawyers. THE following petition from Chicago lawyers has been sent to Congress by the National Religious Liberty Association, relative to the closing of the Fair on Sunday:Š To the Honorable the Senate of the United States in Congress Assembled: We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully, but decidedly, protest against the Congress of the United States commit-ting the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposi-tion on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation.
