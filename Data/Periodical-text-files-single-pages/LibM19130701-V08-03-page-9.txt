LIBERTY 103 to dictate the policy of the government and compel those who do not see fit to conform to their ideas of religion to follow their manner of worship. Said the father of our country : " Any man conducting himself as a good citizen, and being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to be pro-tected in worshiping the Deity accord-ing to the dictates of his own con-science." These efforts put forth to break down the barriers of religious freedom should be looked upon by all  good Americans as a menace to freedom, and should be resisted. Again, notwith-standing the fact that this legislation is being pushed by the most prominent min-isters of the land, it is not in harmony with the true principles of the gospel or its great Author, who said, " My kingdom is not of this world," and " Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's ; and unto God the things that are God's." What Christ has separated, we must not unite. College Place, Wash. The Christian Citizenship Program H. W.
