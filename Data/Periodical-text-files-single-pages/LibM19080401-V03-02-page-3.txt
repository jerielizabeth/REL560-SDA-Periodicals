                                 LIBERTY         Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof. Lev. 25: 1o.                                  Vol,. III SECOND QUARTER, 1908 No. 2                     Editorial Our Position Reaffirmed WE desire that our position in the mat-ter of religion and the state should be clearly understood. We stand in a class by ourselves. As to the state: we are neither anarchists nor socialists, but supporters of civil government as divinely ordained. As to religion: we are neither atheists, infidels, nor secularists, but firm believers in the religion of Christ as taught in the Holy Scriptures. As to theology : we are not supporters of the " New Theology " nor of the " Old Theology," as these terms are generally understood, but of the plain teach-ing of the Scriptures irrespective of creed or tradition. We claim to occupy the origi-nal Protestant ground, as set forth in the celebrated Protest of Spires, adopted April 15, 1529. " Now," says D'Aubigne, the his-torian of the Reformation, " this protest opposes two abuses of man in matters or faith: the first is the intrusion of the civil magistrate, and the second the abitrary au-thority of the church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power of conscience above the magistrate; and the authority of the Word of God above the visible church." We are uncompromisingly opposed to the first step in the direction of a union of church and state, or of religion and the government, because civil government was established to have authority in the realm of civil affairs, in those things which con-cern men as citizens of this world, and  can never rightfully take cognizance of men as citizens of the heavenly kingdom, or of their duties and relations to God. So long as men conduct themselves as good citizens, and do not interfere with the civil rights of others, the state has no right to interfere with their religious beliefs or prac-tises. " To pretend to a dominion over the conscience is to usurp the prerogative of God." The civil magistrate has no power in matters of faith. We regard the present demand for relig-ious legislation by the representatives of the professed church of Christ as a depar-ture from the teachings of Christ and a de-nial of the fundamental principle of Prot-estantism, and we therefore oppose this demand in the only legitimate way Å  by pre-senting the right principles everywhere, as opportunity offers. We are endeavoring to conduct a campaign of education in behalf of religious liberty for every man, whether he agrees with us or not. We hold to the Christian idea of gov-ernment, based upon the principle enunci-ated by the divine Author of our religion: " Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." We ask for no legislation in be-half of any tenet to which we subscribe; we concede to every man the right to be- lieve, or not to believe, to worship or not to worship, without any interference on the part of the civil magistrate, although we shall seek to persuade as many as pos-
