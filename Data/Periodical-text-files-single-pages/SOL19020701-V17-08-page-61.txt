The lesson topics selected by the Committee cover only a portion of the Bible history from the "Giving of the Manna " (the subject of the first lesson) to the time of Samuel. *:*   The subjects considered contain lessons of great importance, and yet they must of t necessity be somewhat fragmentary, since they are ofttimes widely separated chronolog-ically.
