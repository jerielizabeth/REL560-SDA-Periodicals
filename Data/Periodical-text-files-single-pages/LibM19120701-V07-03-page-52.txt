The rule was upheld during the infancy of this gospel for all men. No sooner was the religion of freedom adopted by the chief of the Roman empire than it was shorn of its character of universality and enthralled by an unholy connection with the unholy state; and so it continued until the new nation, Š the least defiled with the barren scoffings of the eighteenth century, the most sincere believers in Christianity of any people of that age, the chief heir of the Reforma-tion in its purest form,Š when it came to establish a government for the United States, refused to treat faith as a matter to be regulated by a corporate body, or having a headship in a monarch or a state. Vindicating the right of individuality even in re-ligion, and in religion above all, the new nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relation to God the principle first divinely ordained in Judea. It left the management of temporal things to the temporal power; but the' American Constitution, in harmony with the people of the several States, withheld from the federal government the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience, the sanctuary of the soul; and not from indifference, but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom and purity and power.Š Bancroft's "History of the For-mation of the Constitution," Vol. V, chap. 1. r1 411‚ ok '0 t, Š - N DAMINIMIN.0Ł1Ł04M.14=111.04M.1411M41.1=0.M.....111Ł04041M.0142.1M1.4M1.04ﬂ.4ŁMIP.M... vvoy wow AV°  MOW ;vie Atio t ;WM 1.41/4 ‚‚401.1zW4g!14 ikt4y4i.
