360 AMERICAN SENTINEL. SOME interesting correspondence relative to the Red Cross Society's work in Cuba, as affected by its alliance with the United States military forces, is given in an ar-ticle by George Kennan, in The Outlook, for May 28. It is related that on May 2, Miss Clara Barton addressed a letter to the commander of the blockading squadron, Admiral Sampson, asking permission to land supplies of food in Cuba for the starving reconcentrados, from the steamer chartered by the Red Cross Society,Šthe "State of Texas." The quotation following is from this letter.  the Spanish; and that therefore he could not grant her the permission asked. This conclusion of course was natural enough from a military point of view. But this is not the Christian point of view. This is not the point of view of one who believes in the power of God and in God's readiness to exercise that power for the accomplishment of Christian work. Christian work must be undertaken with a reli-ance upon the power of God, and not upon the power of man. The feeding of starving women and children in Cuba should have been undertaken by Christians in the name of Christ and with a reliance upon divine power and protection. Let the civil government undertake the work, if it will, relying upon the power of its army and navy. Civil government cannyt be expected to proceed in any other way. Its whole stock in trade is force; it must use this or nothing. But let Christians proceed by the power of love and of the Spirit of God. Not to do this is to 'demonstrate that they are Christians only in profession. * "PAPERS forwarded by direction of our Government will have shown the charge intrusted to me; viz., to get food to the starving people of Cuba. I have with me a cargo of 1,400 tons, under the flag of the Red Cross, the one international emblem of neutrality and humanity known to civilization. Spain knows and regards it. "Fourteen months ago the entire Spanish govern-ment at Madrid cabled me permission to take and distri-bute food to the suffering people in Cuba. This official permission was broadly published. If read by our peo-ple, no response was made and no action taken until two months ago, when, under the humane and gracious call of our honored President, I did go and distribute food, unmolested anywhere on the island, until arrangements were made by our Government for all American citizens to leave Cuba. Persons must now be dying there by hundreds, if not thousands, daily, for want of the food we are shutting out. Will not the world hold us account-able? Will history write us blameless? Will it not be said of us that we completed the scheme of extermination com-menced by Weyler? "Fortunately, I know the Spanish authorities in Cuba, Captain-General Blanco and his assistants. We parted with perfect friendliness. They do not regard me as an American merely, but as the National representa-tive of an international treaty to which they themselves are signatory and under which they act. I believe they would receive and confer with me if such a thing were made possible. "I should like to ask Spanish permission and protec-tion to land and distribute food now on the 'State of Texas.' Could I be permitted to ask to see them under flag of truce? If we make the effort and are refused, the blame rests with them; if we fail to make it, it rests with us." * * * To this the American commander replied, that he was charged with the duty of keeping supplies of food out of Cuba, believing that supplies sent to the island unaccom-panied by a military force would fall into the hands of COULD not Christian people have had sufficient faith in God to have believed that he would open the way for them to have rescued the perishing, through the opposi-tion of Spain and even of the American forces? As Miss Barton's letter indicates, there is reason to believe that Spain would not have been hostile to work done by the Red Cross Society, as such, and without an alliance with any military power; and as regards the opposition of Admiral Sampson, it is to be noted as a significant fact that an unarmed' steamshipŠthe "Gussie"Šwas per-mitted to attempt to land supplies in Cuba, unaccompa-nied by any armed force, precisely as Miss Barton re-quested permission to do. * * ALL facts considered, it is clear enough that the work of relieving the suffering Cubans has been undertaken with very little if any manifestation of faith in God. The Government, of course, cannot be blamed for this; it could not proceed in any other way than it has done. But people who profess to be Christians, and who talk about this war as being undertaken from Christian mo-tives, may well pause and ask themselves how much real Christianity there has been manifested in it, and how far they themselves are responsible for the terrible conditions that are now known to exist in the island. It is a seri-ous matter, and will warrant serious reflection on their part. THE well-known writer, George Kennan, in describing some recent experience at Key West, tells of meeting some of the captured Spaniards, who with their ships, had been taken by the vessels of the American fleet. In speaking of these he says that "On the schooner 'Power of God,' there seemed to be more wild, cruel, piratical types than on any other vessel, except perhaps 'St. James the Apos-
