WHITE, Author of "The Life of Christ," "Sketches from the Life of Paul," Bible Sanctification," and other popular works. PRINTED AND BOUND IN THE VERY BEST STYLE. OVER TEN THOUSAND SOLD IN SIX MONTHS. This volume presents the most wonderful and intensely interesting history that has ever been written of the great conflict between Christianity and the powers of darkness, as illustrated in the lives of Christian martyrs and reformers on one hand, and wicked men and persecuting powers on the other. Beginning with our Lord's great prophecy given while viewing Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, in which he outlines the history of the whole dispensation, it sketches the fulfillment. It pictures the siege and overthrow of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the Temple. It calls our attention to the bit-ter persecutions of the Christians in the first centuries, and notes the rise and growth of the Papacy. It gives a clear conception of the character and influence of the Waldenses, who, through centuries of persecution, maintained the purity of their faith, and by their mis-sionary efforts prepared the nations of Europe for the Reformation. Brief and lifelike sketches are given of the works, the successes, and the persecutions of Wycliffe, Luther, Tyndale, Huss, Jerome, Knox, and other reformers and martyrs. Considerable space is given to the life, work, and influence of later reformers and great religious leaders, such as George Whitefield, the Wesleys, and William Miller, and this is followed by chapters treat-ing  upon The Origin of Evil, The Agency of Evil Spirits, The Snares of Satan, and the Judgment. The style of the author is clear, forcible, and often sublime, and, although simple enough in its statements to be understood and ap-preciated by a child, its eloquence calls forth the admiration of all Over 500 pages; 22 full-page cuts.
