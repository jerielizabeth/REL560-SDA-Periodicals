664 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY the ancient pagan nations, of which Rome was a conspicuous example, the political and religious life of the nation be expressed in one and the same social Organization Š the state. Some Relics of the Old System of Things Remain But while it is true that religious liberty has been realized in America as nowhere else, and the true principle has been recognized and established in the supreme law of the nation and has vir-tually become the common law through-out the land, some relics of the old church-and-state system of things are.  still to be found even to-day after a century and a quarter of religious lib-erty and the "new order of things." It can hardly be said that a citizen's right to bear witness is not called in question for reasons of religion when a condition of his testifying in a court of justice is that he must lay his hand on a book that is regarded as the book of religion and solemnly take an oath which has reference to the sanctions of religion and the penalties which are to be received in some other state than this, and which God and not man is to visit. It can hardly be said that the state does not appropriate public moneys for the propagation of religion when teachers of religion Š chaplains Š are maintained in the army and navy and are employed to pray in the places of legislation at public expense, or when the educational and semi-chari-table institutions of religious bodies are given grants from public treasuries, or when the missionary-educational work of religious bodies receives support from the public treasury, as was the case for a term of years not-  long ago when the national government gave an-nual grants of money to most of the leading religious bodies of the country for their missionary-educational work among the Indians. And the Ł custom,  which seems to be more scrupulously adhered to now than formerly, on the part of the chief executive officer of the nation and of each State of appoint-ing a day for thanksgiving each year and of officially directing or recom-mending that the people assemble in their respective places of worship and there worship God, seems hardly con-sistent with the idea that the civil power is limited to civil things and has no authority in matters of faith and worship. But there remains, unfortunately, a still more serious relic of that old sys-tem of things which it was supposed that America had shaken off entirely, and which she certainly had in prin-ciple. Would you believe me when I tell you that on the statute books of every State in this nation, with one, and possibly two, exceptions, there is a law, a penal statute, which is absolutely op-posed to and utterly irreconcilable with the idea that the church cannot look to the state for any support of its wor-ship or institutions, am d that. the civil power has no authority in or over the individual or the church in matters of faith, worship, order, discipline, etc.; a statute which could never have been enacted and which cannot exist except upon the assumption that the church can look to the state for support for its worship and institutions, and that the civil power does have authority in matters of faith and worship and church polity and discipline? And would you believe me when I tell you that here and there throughout the United States, unfortunately and with ill omen far more so in the last two decades than ever before in the history of the coun-try, the civil rights of individuals are frequently invaded, their property " is confiscated in the shape of fines, and sometimes they are imprisoned, and even in some instances have been placed
