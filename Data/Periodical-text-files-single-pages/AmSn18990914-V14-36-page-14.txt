THE RIGHTS THE PEOPLE, or CIVIL GOVERNI1ENT AND RELIGION. BY ALONZO T. JONES.

The book then takes up the history and principles of the movement so active now in the United States, ooking toward having the church try to regulate and cleanse politics, and shows what will be the certain results of following the policy advocated.
