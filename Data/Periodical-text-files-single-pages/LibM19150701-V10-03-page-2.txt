We believe in God, in the Bible as the word of God, and in the separation ! of church and state as taught by Jesus Christ. I5. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every individual to / Iworship or not to worship, according to the dictates of his own conscience, provided I / that in the exercise of this right he respects the equal rights of others. / 6. We believe that all religious legislation tends to unite church and state, is subversive of human rights, persecuting in character, and opposed to the best inter- ! ests of both church and state. / 1 7. We believe, therefore, that it is not within the province of civil government I to legislate on religious questions. / / 8. We believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to pre- / j vent religious legislation, and oppose all movements tending to unite church and i state, that all may enjoy the inestimable blessings of civil and religious liberty. III / g. We believe in the inalienable and constitutional right of free speech, free j press, peaceable assembly, and petition.  io. We also believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to /i 1 society. !

We believe that the ten commandments are the law of God, and that they / Icomprehend man's whole duty to God and man. / 1 3.

We believe in civil government as divinely ordained to protect men in the j enjoyment of their natural rights and to rule in civil things, and that in this realm I it is entitled to the respectful obedience of all. !
