756 AMERICAN SENTINEL. Saving or Losing the Sabbath. [A SURE evidence of the human and altogether earthly character of the first-day sabbath, is the fact that its adherents are constantly appealing to human authority and earthly power for its support. With reference to this subject an exchange prints the follow-ing:Š] A contributor to the Christian Guardian presents, as "a question of vital interest, of prime importance," Ł the problem, "Shall we save or lose our Christian Sab-bath?" By "our Christian Sabbath" he means the Sun-day institution. The very fact of his concern as to whether it will be saved or lost is evidence that he refers to a man-made institution. There never was, and never can be any question as to the permanence and stability of the Lord's Sabbath. The Lord sanctified the seventh-day Sabbath in the beginning (Gen. 2:2,_3),.  and has written it in his law (Ex. 20:8-11), as a holy dayŠ"My holy day" (Isa. 58:13,14). And this law is not to be changed in as much as "one jot or one tittle" while heaven and earth stand (Matt. 5:17-19); more-over it will be a permanent institution in the new earth (Isa. 66:22, 23). That the Sunday-sabbath, which its adherents are pleased to call "our Christian Sabbath," is not the Lord's Sabbath, nor at all of the Lord, is shown in the entire silence of the Scriptures upon the subject. "Who hath required this at your hands?" Surely not the Lord. Then it must be of man, a work of supereroga-tion. In further support of this position we have the fact that Sunday-sabbath advocates are constantly appealing to human authority for its preservation and enforcement. In the article to which reference has been made we find this urgent statement:Š "Steps should be taken to make and enforce strong representations to parliaments and governments and to bring pressure, connectionally and otherwise, to bear upon them in behalf of Sabbath laws and administra-tion. There should be organizations upon the circuits. Meetings should be held and money raised in the inter-ests of the campaign." Now the Lord disposes of all man -madeinstitutions, in his own good time, in this way: "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up." Matt. 15:13 All the Sunday-law agitations, and all the Sunday-law persecutions, and all the pleas for human protection of the Sunday institution, merely emphasize the fact that it is "of men," and "it will come to naught" (Acts 5:38, 39); for "every oneŁ of us shall give account of himself [not to the civil government, but] to God." Rom. 14:12. When we come into the judgment of God to give account of our Sabbath-keep-ing, the law of God and not of man will bethe standard. "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13. The one who keeps the  commandments of God will have sufficient discernment to understand the limit of his obligation to human law; for the Scripture makes it very plain that "we ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29. These considerations ought to convince any believer in God's Word where he ought to stand on this "ques-tion of vital interest, of prime importance." The Lord will preserve his own Sabbath without human legisla-tion; yea, rather, in spite of it. No one need to worry about losing the Lord's Sabbath; that is fixed forever. The concern of each individual should be, to remember it and observe itŠin letter and in spirit. This is the point concerning the Sabbath for which account will have to be rendered to God. How Sunday Newspapers Were Killed in England. Ix the Sunday School Times of November 25, Mr. Henry S. Lunn, M. D., of London, England, tells "How Sunday Newspapers Were Killed in England." Dr.Lunn appears to have been foremost in the opposition to "seven-day journalism" in that country; and he intends shortly to come to America and take the lead in a great crusade that is being planned here, against the Sunday papers. In the first place, he says, "I wrote to all the bishops of the Anglican church and to the heads of the Non-conformist communions, urging that they should take action immediately to combat this grave innovation." This they did; and "day by day the opposition gained strength, and the papers found themselves confronted by forces which had probably never worked in unison on any previous occasion. "The bishops in the Upper House of Convocation passed a strong resolution deprecating this journalistic departure. The Nonconformists, represented by my friend, the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, ex-president of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference, and by the Rev. Dr. Robertson Nicoll, the able editor of the British Weekly, were found in alliance with the 'left wing' of the Labor party, headed by that stalwart Radical, Mr. John Burns. The Institute of Journalists also denounced the new movement, and published some remarkable opinions of American journalists, showing the killing pressure under which the pressman in America works, owing to seven-day journalism." Mr. Lunn withdrew his advertisements from the offending dailies (the Mail and Telegraph), and induced some other leading advertisers to do the same. Next he succeeded in organizing a "special committee" of opposi-tion, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as president, and the Bishop of London, Cardinal Vaughan, Rabbi Adler, and other prominent men among its officers. A "special parliamentary committee" was also formed, to wait upon the Home Secretary and if possible induce him to
