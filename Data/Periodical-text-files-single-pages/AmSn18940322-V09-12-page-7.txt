WITH GRATITUDE TO GOD FOR THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN OMPI ETE VEST-POCKET MARCH 22, 1894.     A.IVILE.11,11 C 95 actly as if I were being received by the President of the United States. "I wondered how the pope knew what the ceremony of the White House was, as he had never been out of Rome, but in a few moments I was ushered in. His holiness erode and offered me his hand, then he told me to sit down, and sat down himself beside me. I was somewhat embarressed as to what I should say, but I started in by thanking him for receiving me, and I told him how the many thousand men who are employed by the corporation I represented, two-thirds of whom were Catholics, would be pleased to hear of this audience on my return to America. This sug-gested the subject of capital and labor, and the pope started in to speak on that subject. It was the most eloquent speech I have ever heard. I would not do justice to it if I tried to repeat it to you. The soul of it was that all men should follow the Golden Rule, and remember that, being born of one Father, they must in the end stand before the same Father in judg-ment." After the address supper was served to the distin-guished guests in one of the dining rooms, and the other guests found seats in the many rooms of the club house and enjoyed cake and champagne. It is not stated how many of the " pas-tors " of the city partook of the cham-pagne, but the presence of so many "Prot-estant " ministers at such an entertainment is sufficiently significant in itself. It is certainly an omen of the fulfillment of that prophecy which says of the papal beast: " All that dwell upon the earth shall wor-ship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." Ł 4  Ł  No Distinctively Religious Garb in the Pittsburg Schools. AT the meeting of the Municipal Board of Education of the city of Pittsburg, Pa., March 13, the subject of the dress of the nuns who teach in the Riverside public school came up. After a short discussion the following was passed by a vote of twenty-nine to three :Š Resolved, That the wearing by any of the teachers in the schools of this city during school hours in the school rooms of any garb or dress distinctive of and indicating any religious order, or any attachments or adornment on their person symbolic of any such order, or of any of the teachings of any particular religion or creed, is sectarian -within the spirit and meaning of section 2, article 10, ®f the constitution of this State. viz: "No money raised for the support of the public schools in the commonwealth shall be appropriated to or used for the support of any sectarian.school." This aetion is right. The fact that an individual is a member of a `religious order should not be a bar to becoming a teacher, but to permit the wearing, in public schools, of distinctive garbs and symbols, which have, and are designed to have, a distinctively religious and sectarian influ-ence, is clearly contrary to the spirit of American institutions. .4. Romanists After the Regency. THERE promises to be an interesting fight over the election of a Regent of the University to succeed the late Bishop Mc-Nierny, of this city. Among the candi-dates Are Rev. Mr. Malone, of Brooklyn; Bishop Gabriels, of Ogdensburg, and Bishop McQuade, of Rochester, all Roman Catholics. The argument is made that as the deceased regent was a Romanist his successor should be of that faith. Rowland Blennerhassett Mahony, of Buffalo, ex-Minister to Ecuador, was here yesterday lobbying against the candidacy of Bishop McQuade. He is supposed to be representing Bishop Ryan, of the Buf-falo diocese. Bishop McQuade is an enemy of the public school system, while Bishop Ryan stands for the liberal and Americanized element in the church.ŠMail and Express, February 28, THE PARLIAMENT OF RELIGIONS.

FATHERS OF THE (DAY-rm.-1E40T  1, I C C.:24  ILT (C1Hl  BY E. J. WAGGONER. History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the princi-ples of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adop-tion of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of pa-ganism. ^- ) chapter on CLINI-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.
