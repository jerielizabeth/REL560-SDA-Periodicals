380 Tf.t AM81 ICAN sNerTNEL,. "Sunday in Great Britain." THIS is the heading of an article pub-lished in the Westminster Review in A. D. 1856. The article shows distinctly, that, from its very earliest origin, the Sun- day Sabbatarian idea has tended both to religious and civil bondage. It shows also that in the controversy arising in the .past attempts to enforce Sunday by law, almost every argument now brought for- ward by Mr. Crafts, and the American Sabbath Union, as something entirely new, and based on the fierce competition of our modern civilization, has been brought forward before, and fairly re-plied to by the friends of liberty. The paper is very long, and space for-bids to do more than transcribe a few of the most striking passages. In speaking of the well known historical fact, that the Puritans were the first people to give to the gradually developing Sunday festival the distinctly Sabbatic idea, the Review very aptly says :Š They invented the sin of Sabbath-breaking. They called a thing wrong, and persuaded others to treat a thing as wrong, which had been held to be right through the long ages of Christian antiquity, and is still held to be right throughout the whole of continental Europe. They proved it was wrong by arguments which would be ludicrous if they had not been so successful. However weak their logic may have been, the fact remains that they suc-ceeded. They invented the sin, and they estab-lished it; they raised a new external standard by which men have ever since gone on judging each other's grapes and figs; they have ruined thousands who have been thrown into despair by being told they have committed this sin, and embittered the lives of thousands more who are not quite sure they have avoided it. They invented the sin of Sabbath-breaking as certainly and as effectually as the priests of Egypt and India invented the sin of killing a cow. It is frightful to think how much these sins of human invention have cost mankind, and how much the world has suffered even from men as honest as the Puritans. If the victim of a Scotch Sunday could but know the history of the day on which he suffers, he would at any rate start with something like a conviction as to his future duty. This last is also true of the present victims of the Sunday superstition, and the Sunday laws. However this may be with the victims, the ambitious clergy, who are seeking political power, and thinking to establish a theocracy through Sunday legislation, are now, as then, not deterred in the slightest from carrying out their pet scheme by a mere matter of history. After quite a lengthy account of the use of the Sunday festival, and its gradual metamorphosis into the modern Sabbath, the paper continues :Š The doctrine of the Sabbath was imported from England into Scotland, about the close of the sixteenth century, and as the rigor of Scotch Puritanism had by that time greatly increased, an innovation which was so much akin to the Puritan spirit, found ready acceptance north of the Tweed. The different bodies of spiritual governors imme-diately set to work, driving people to church, fining them, imprisoning them, and bewildering them with petty regulations, until, finally, they had cut off all liberty of action. Several collections of the ordinances of the Kirk session have been published  recently, and there ludicrous have the whole record of this mournful but ludicrous history. There are scarcely any contemporary documents which equally set before us the life of the quiet homely citizen of the day, or show more clearly under what a frightful spiritual bondage he was gradually falling. All games were strictly prohibited. One man is " set at the pillars " for playing at bowls on the Sabbath; another is fined twenty shillings for playing at football. Salmon fisheries gave especial. trouble; some resolute sportsmen even bade defi-ance to the elders of the Kirk, and fished in spite of them. But generally, their tyranny was only too successful. We read of an unfortunate widow having to pay eight marks "for having spits and roasts at the fire in time of sermon." Even peace-ful exercise, and walking in the fresh air, was rigorously put down. " Vaging " in the streets, or a stroll to Castlehill, was punished with imprison-ment. An unhappy sinner named David Dugall was censured for "going to Cramond on. the Lord's day morning with shoes," and was obliged to find surety against a repetition of the offense. The magistrates and their spiritual rulers were to see that the ordinances of the sessions were executed, and it was directed that they " shall go up and down upon the Lord's day, after the afternoon sermon, and cause take particular notice of such as shall be found foorth of their houses, vaging upon the streets, and cause cite them before the session, to be rebuked and censured." The climax of folly and tyranny was, perhaps, reached by the Edin-burgh Session, who ordered, April 5, 1658, that "the magistrates is to cause some English soldiers goe along the streets, and those outparts above written, both before sermon and after sermon, and lay hold both upon young and old, whom they find out of their houses or out of church." After all this, and much more, this writer asks And now how is Sunday at the present time (1856), actually observed in Scotland and England ?" This is a very important question, for as the same measures are now being advocated kr securing the " proper observance " of Sunday here in this country, it is well to know what kind of an observance is thus preached. The paper continues :Š Of the Scottish Sabbath, it is scarcely possible to speak with the moderation due to any custom obtaining in a nation which possesses so many claims to respect and which displays so many signs of real religious life. The Scotch Sunday is one of the most mournful sights to be seen by one who has learned from St. Paul, the doctrine of Chris-tian liberty. Ignorant fanaticism has made the Scotch more Judaical than the Jews, and their casuistry more miserable than that of the Talmud-ists. Even the Puritans, who issued their edicts against men taking a quiet stroll on Sunday through the city streets and country lanes, could hardly have believed that their descendants, two centuries later, would actually draw down the blinds on Sunday, lest their eyes should wander abroad and admire the glory of the handiwork of God. In the nineteenth century of the Christian era, in a country where the gospel has been preached by men who have freely bled for its sake; in a country which has produced rational beings like Adam Smith and Sir Walter Scott, it is actually thought a satisfactory homage to God, for men on one day in the week to draw down the blinds of their windows and only look into each others mournful countenances. If Mungo Park had discovered an African tribe that did this, what lamentations we should have had over their blind-ness, what subscriptions, and meetings, and schemes for their conversion. We do not mean this as a universal custom but it is one frequent enough to be quoted as a Scotch observance. Yet it is a fact that enlightened Massa-chusetts, in this present year of grace, has  furnished a parallel to this picture of Scottish penance. In a convention of the American Sab-bath Union, held in Lowell last June, a minister testified that he and his wife were compelled to leave the cool front veranda and shut themselves up in the house, on account of the number of bicyclers and pleasure riders, who came thronging by. He said a good woman in Lynn, whose house was near the beach, was com-pelled to lock herself in a dark room, every Sunday, for fear of breaking the Sabbath. This is the kind of Sabbath which the American Sabbath Union seeks to make universal in this country. Al-ready they have declared that there is no recreation fit for the Sabbath, outside of the home and the sanctuary. But we will close this article with one more quotation from the Westminster Review:Š Great efforts have been made in Scotland to stop all railway traveling whatever on Sunday. Mr. Cox combated this monstrous proposal with great earnestness; and, although he was beaten in the particular instance which gave rise to his book, he and those who have worked with him have had some success, and on the main lines communication is open throughout the week. They also managed, by great exertion and perseverance, to start a Sunday steamer on the Clyde; but the outcry of the clergy was fearful. And what does this outcry lead to? It leads, on the one hand, to an external, an unreal observance, and on the other, to gross immorality. What is a poor Scotchman to do on a day that he has not to labor, but may not go out and refresh himself in the open air ? What he actually does is to soak himself with whiskey. Sunday drunkeness in the large Scotch towns had reached such a frightful pitch that, in 1854, the Forbes Mackenzie Act was passed, prohibiting the sale of all fermented liquors on Sunday. Men have begun to get drunk on Monday and Tuesday instead. The same results will be seen here from the same causes. When the means of getting out into the country on Sunday are taken away, as also the means of amusement and instruction in art galleries, and natural history museums, etc., the result will be that social clubs will be formed, by the thousand, which, meeting on Sunday in private houses, will engage in card playing, and carousing with wines and liquors purchased the evening before. G. E. FIFIELD. WRITING of Alaska, Rev. N. W. Conk- ling says :Š The spoils system extends its wonderful sway even to these far-off shores, and the lust of office induces men to leave their homes in the States and take petty positions in this distant and isolated country. Alas, alas ! there are many abuses yet to be remedied before our country becomes what it should be in accord with its name and fame throughout the earth. So long as human nature remains what it is now, the abuses which the Doctor de-plores are practically unavoidable to some extent, in civil government, but the Church might be kept comparatively free from them by keeping it entirely separate from the State. State aid corrupts the Church and does not improve the State, indeed, it corrupts both Church and State.
