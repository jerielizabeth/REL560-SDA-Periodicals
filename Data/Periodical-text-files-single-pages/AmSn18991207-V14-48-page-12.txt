764 AMERICAN SENTINEL. The Church and the State. ONE of the signs telling of the last days is that pro-fessed Christians will have "a form of godliness," while "denying the power thereof." 2 Tim. 3:1-5. As illus-trating this, note the following spoken by Rev. Cyrus F. Wixon, in an address to the Chautauqua circle of the Trinity-Methodist Church : Š "Justice to humanity demands that in order to ob-literate a hereditary source of crime the individual must die. . . . I would chloroform these confirmed crimi-nals. . . . In death by chloroform there is no pain, nothing revolting." The editor of the New York Journal, commenting on Wixon's theory, said:Š "Thus the Rev. Mr. Wixon, a Christian minister, serving Him who said, 'Thou shalt not kill,' would re-form the world by making it a shambles. . . . If the Wixon law were put into effect its author should tag each soul of the 100,000 souls which he would free with an explanatory prayer to this effect: 'We hereby return this poor soul to its Maker as unsatisfactory. We hope that in future He will be pleased to furnish mankind with souls of better quality.'" Apropos of this the following letter was written to the Journal:Š "Editor of the New York Journal: "The Scriptural reply to Rev. Wixon's unchristian method of exterminating criminals should be the same as the answer Christ made to the Sadducees: 'Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.' If the gospel of Christ has not enough of the power of God in it, when acting in harmony with the Divine will, to transform the veriest wretch, who is a sinner both by hereditary weaknesses and by acquired transgressions, to the image of his Maker, it falls short of its teachings. The power of salvation is exactly what the ministry ought to make known to the laity. If by precept and by example the preacher is not a living exponent of this power, possibly some other calling would be more in consonance with his pretensions." CYRUS SIMMONS. Knoxville, Tenn. What Rome Desires. FROM certain demands recently made by the clerical party in Spain, and from certain statements recently uttered by the leading Catholic organ of the world, the Osservatore Romano, certain desires and aims of the papacy which are of decided interest to all non-Roman-ists are made too plain to be overlooked or denied. On this point we note the following in The Outlook:Š "At the recent Catholic Congress at Burgos [Spain], the longing for a restoration of temporal power was un-blushingly shown. The prelates there assembled drew up a pronunciamento in which they demanded that no text-books but those approved by the bishops should be  used in the universities, and that public instruction throughout the kingdom should be Catholic. They de-clared that, no ecclesiastic should be punished by the ordinary civil courts of justice, and that none should pay taxes. Furthermore, they demanded exemption from.military service for all seminarists under twenty-seven years of age, and for all priests; and lastly, they had the assurance to ask that all associations not Cath-olic should be prohibited. "The desire for temporal power is shown, not only by the Roman Catholic prelates and journals of Italy, Spain, and France, but even by that official journal of the whole church, the Osservatore Romano. This paper, publishing daily official notices from Leo XIII. and his secretaries, papal documents, and important communi-cations on ecclesiastical affairs, has deservedly great weight with all Romanists. It declares that in the pres-ent conflict between two 'heretical' powers there is to be no overthrow of Romanism in Manila; in South Africa it sees some chance for the Roman Church. It asks: `Can it be that this war is providential? Will Protest-antism be exhausted by it? Has the period of the great transformation of the world begun, when the church will accomplish a new conversion of the Gentiles? Let us have courage, determination, and faith in God, who is ever the God of armies.'" If it is true, as this official organ of Leo XIII. and his prelates in Rome declares, that there is to be na overthrow of Romanism in Manila, then there is.  to be no separation of church and state in Manila; for there is an overthrow of Romanism wherever a long-estab-lished union of church and state is broken up. We fear the Osservatore Romano knows whereof it speaks upon this point. The United States is referred to as an "heretical" power, which indeed it is, from the papal point of view. But why does the pope profess so much friendship (as he now does) for this heretical power? It would be a providential thing in the Roman view if war were to break out between all the Protestant,  nations and rage until they had devoured each other, and Protestantism had thereby become exhausted. A Soldier's View of It. Philippine Correspondence of "Washington Post." THE benefits to be derived by the United States in conquering this island seem small in comparison to the deaths and hardships endured by the troops. There are no tracts of land to be taken up; there is no opening for the laborer or mechanic. Every available acre of ground is tilled, and in buildings suitable for this climate the native is far superior, for nothing seems impossible to him with a bolo and bamboo. Of course, the mon-eyed man has great propects before him in investments, but for the brawn and muscle of America's sons that are enduring the torrid sun and marching through vapors of malaria and typhoid fever, the bright vision ever before them is to have their enlistment of three years
