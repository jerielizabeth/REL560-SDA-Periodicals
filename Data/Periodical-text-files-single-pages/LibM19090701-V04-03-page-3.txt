LIBERTY Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof. Lev. 25 :10. Vol..

True Protestantism stands for the largest liberty in the mat-ter of conscience consistent with the equal liberty of others, and for the Word of God as the unfailing guide in matters of faith and morals. The movement now in progress for the union of re-ligion and the state, with the consequent interference of the state in matters of conscience, and the strong attacks now being made upon the Bible as the Word of God and upon divine authority in mat-
