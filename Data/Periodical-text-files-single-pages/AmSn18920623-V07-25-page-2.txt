194 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. a Mr. Cox, who was not an Adventist: " Do you consider it necessary for a man to work six days ?" Answer:Š" Yes sir." The witness was then asked by the At-torney-General: " You do not think it necessary for people to work on Sunday, do you ?" Answer:Š " No, sir." But Mr. Cox had already testified that it was necessary to work six days; therefore, according to this witness for the State of Tennessee, the man who believes that he ought to keep the seventh day, is, by the Sunday law of Tennessee, under the neces-sity of violating either his conscience or the law of the State. He is not left per-fectly free to keep any day, but must keep Sunday or else fail of securing what are termed the necessaries of life. a. P. B. Tried for His Faith. WE have given in the last two numbers of THE SENTINEL Some account of the trials of the Seventh-day Adventists in-dicted by the January Grand Jury of Henry County, Tenn., for working on Sunday.

The trial was held in Paris, Henry County, Tenn., May 27; before Circuit Judge W. H. S wiggart. The counsel for the State was Attorney-General J. W. Lewis. The defendant, W. S. Lowry (as also the other defendants), feeling that he was on trial for his religious faith, de-clined counsel, committing his case to the Lord, in accordance with Luke 12: 11, 12, and parallel scriptures.

The jury were sworn in groups of four, each juror placing the tips of his fingers upon a copy of the Bible, while the clerk who held the book repeated the oath. The indictment was then read, as fol- lows :Š State of Tennessee, F Jan. Term, A. D. 1892.
