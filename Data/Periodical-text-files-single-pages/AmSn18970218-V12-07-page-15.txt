Pitcairn Island, one of the volcanic gems of the Pacific, has been heard of wherever the Eng-lish language has been spoken. The story of the -working out of the problem of human life on its limited territory reads stranger and more thrill-ingly in many respects than a romance. But most, if not all, of the tales told and books printed have either been too fragmentary or in-correct and misleading. It will be interesting to the friends of that miniature world to know that an authentic history has been written, and that by a native of the island, one to the manor born. Miss Rosa Young is one of the direct descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty. The book.is a plain, unvarnished tale of Pitcairn and its inhab-itants from its settlement to the year 1894. It is written with a charming simplicity of style which refreshes the reader and invites a contin-ual perusal. Illustrated with 26 engravings by the half-tone process, and its 23 chapters have each a neatly engraved heading. Price, - Ł Ł 81.00 PACIFIC PRESS PUPLISHING CO., 39 Bond St., New York City, N. Y.
