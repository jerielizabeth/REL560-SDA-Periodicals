AMERICAN SENTINEL. 571 Religious Persecution of the Finns. [THE case of the Finnish people, who are now being made the victims of religious by intolerance the Russian Greek Church, is concisely stated by The Examiner, of this city, as follows:Š] "The prosperity of the nations rests on right and equity," said the Russian Czar, in his famous "Peace Rescript." The fine sentiment has been widely ap-plauded. Just before uttering it, however, the Czar issued a ukase affecting his Finnish subjects,from which, rather than from his peace overtures, history is likely to judge him. His treatment of the Finns can hardly fail to be regarded hereafter as an illuminating episode of his reign. It is also one of more than ordinary contem-poraneous interest. Finland's history began in the twelfth . century, when the kings of Sweden warred upon the Finnish heathen, subdued and forcibly baptized them. The country remained under Swedish dominion, enjoying a Swedish constitution and social organization based on individual political liberty, until 1808, when Alexander I. of Russia, to achieve the final conquest of Finland, declared war against Sweden, and, in 1809, wrested her principality from her. His chief aim in securing it was to create a natural bulwark in the northwest for the capital of his empire. Soon after the conquest he sum-moned the Estates of Finland to assemble, and, after receiving their homage, made an address, in which he assured them of his friendly and conservative intentions. On March 29, 1809, he caused to be promulgated the "Declaration of Borgo," whereby he confirmed and ratified the religion and fundamental laws of the Grand Duchy (which Finland had become under Russia), and all the privileges and rights which each class and al] the inhabitants, high and low, had hitherto enjoyed accord-ing to their constitution. These assurances, by imperial ukase of February, 1816, he confirmed "for all time to come," guaranteeing to his Finnish subjects a separate constitution, "under our scepter and that of our heirs," as the document runs. On the principles thus established Finland has been ruled and administered for almost one hundred years. Four emperors, including the present one, have since Ł taken the constitutional oath to obsel.ve their origina compacts and guarantees. But, after the death of Alex-ander II., the reactionary triumph in Russia began to make its influence felt in her attitude toward Finland. Pressure was brought to bear on the Czar by the bu-reaucracy to induce him to abolish Finnish autonomy. Alexander III. created commissions whose business was to promote the fusion of Finnish with Russian customs, and a uniformity of the coinage and postal systems. A "codification" of the Finnish fundamental laws was ordered, with a view, it is claimed, to their practical annulment. Matters stood thus, without serious friction, until  the accession of Nicholas II., in 1894. That event in-spired high hopes. Following the example of his prede-cessors, he confirmed and ratified "the religion, the fundamental laws, and the rights and privileges c f every class." But under the constant urgency, it is believed, of Pobidonisteff, the Procurator of the Greek Church, and the reactionary party, he issued a decree in February of the present year which practically an-nulled the legislative powers of the Estates; for, while not rescinding this power in local affairs, it reserved to the emperor, himself, "the ultimate decision as to the laws that come within the scope of the general legisla-tion of the empire." Such legislative autonomy as re-mained was thus reduced to the insignificant task of giving advice in all indeterminate matters which the Russian ministers might please to consider interests common to the empire. The people of Finland heard of this decree with sor-row and amazement. They drew up a petition to the Czar humbly but strenuously protesting against it, and the Estates sent their four presidents to St. Petersburg to lay it at the feet of the monarch. The deputation were not permitted to enter the imperial presence. Meetings were then held throughout the country, and a petition signed by 522,931 men and women of Finland was sent to St. Petersburg by 500 delegates. The governor-general of Finland (Bobrikoff) permitted them to depart, but telegraphed the chief of police at St. Petersburg to forbid their entrance into the city. For some reason, his attempt to shut them out was not successful, but a subsequent telegram is known to have been sent by him to the minister-secretary of state; and, although aware of their presence and of their errand, the Czar refused to see them, and they were peremptorily ordered to return to their homes. The effect has been to crystallize the various Finnish parties in hostility to Russia, and to evoke from them a protest to Christen-dom against the monstrous wrong done to them by their monarch in contravention of his coronation oath. The history of their virtual enslavement, to the end that they may be made amenable to all military and other imposts, casts an interesting sidelight upon the character of the mighty autocrat at whose request a council of the nations is even now discussing a policy of universal peace that shall rest on "right and equity." •a.'  THE universal solvent for social ills and wrongs is liberty. For liberty is the firstfruit of Christianity and of the law which bids us love our neighbor as ourselves. We must apply the law of equal liberty, granting them just what we grant ourselves, to union men and to scabs; to immigrants and to native-born; to Christians and to Jews; to Caucasians and to Chinese; to white men and to negroes. Liberty is the universal solvent; but how unwilling are Christians to grant it to Jews, native-born to immigrants, white men to yellow and
