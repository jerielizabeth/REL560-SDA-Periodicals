XVIII  NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 3, 1903                 NO. 36                                                   A majority has no more right to do injustice than has a minority. "No one ever thinks the majority should rule in re- ligion when the majority are not in harmony with his way of religious thinking." Obedience to the "powers that be" is not the highest duty of a Christian man or any other man. The highest duty of any man is to do right. "The right to coerce any against their conscience to keep a religious holy day is not possessed by man, nor can it be righteously exercised by any human power." Most men see a principle most clearly when it is being violated by others to their injury; few indeed can see a principle when they themselves are violating it to the injury of others. If God has not appointed a definite and particular day as the Sabbath, then men assume a little too much responsi-bility when they select a definite and particular day and say that that is the day God requires to be observed as the Sabbath. Instead of possessing the prerogative to invade the rights of some, it is the duty and function of the majority to pro-tect the rights of allÑto see that the rights of none are invaded. Its business is to protect, not to oppress; to insure justice, not to commit injustice.
