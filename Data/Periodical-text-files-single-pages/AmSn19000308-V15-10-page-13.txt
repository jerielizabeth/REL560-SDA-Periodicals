AMERICAN SENTINEL. 157 I AM a missionary Baptist of the strictest sort, but am in hearty sympathy and accord with the SENTINEL in its advocacy of religious and civil liberty. I have, for many years, recognized the tendency toward imperial. ism, centralization and destruction of the liberties;%of the people and the downfall of the Republic. Friends, who then laughed at me as a pessimist are beginning now to see the breakers and realize the danger. Long may the SENTINEL guard the rights of the common people. I have no sympathy with the agitation nor respect for the judgment of Sunday fanatics. Yours truly, C. M. SHERROUSE. New Orleans, La., January 30, 1900.
