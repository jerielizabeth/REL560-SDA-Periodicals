Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no tears that they will be asked to, pay for It (Entered at the New York Poet-office.) CHRISTIANITY iS intolerant only of sin. It makes no account of crime, as such, HE who renders to God the things that are God's, will not fail to give to Caesar that which is Cmsar's. WHEN Caesar dictates what shall he rendered to God, the latter gets only that which Cmsar does not want for himself. o."10-4-4 THE kind of legislation which debars the "Louisiana lottery" and sanctions church lotteries, will not benefit the country in the long run.

It is evident that if Christ had accepted this offer, he would have taken the kingdoms of the world under Satan. The devil would not have been destroyed, nor
