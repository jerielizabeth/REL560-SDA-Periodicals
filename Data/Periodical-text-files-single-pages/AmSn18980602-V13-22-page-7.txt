AMERICAN SENTINEL. 343 off, and there was issued to the church several hundred millions of dollars in interest-bearing Spanish bonds. This huge block of securities is now held by the Roman Catholic Church. No wonder the pope is anxious to intervene. The interest on these bonds cannot be paid unless Spanish credit is maintained, and protracted war between the United States and Spain means Spanish bankruptcy." A Solemn Warning.ŠNo. 4. BY C. H. KESLAKE. WE have seen that before the beginning of the fourth .century Christianity had united with paganism in sun worship. This was made more complete by Constantine at the beginning of the fourth century. With this union of Christianity and paganism in the worship of the sun, we have perpetuated the day which had centuries before been dedicated to the sun. Thus from this time forth we have Christianity and paganism united in the worship of the sun, and even known after Constantine's professed conversion to Christ as Christi-anity; thus we have in the Roman Catholic Church sun worship as ChristianityŠthus we have in time Christians unconsciously rendering homage to the "Unconquered Sun," at the same time thinking they were rendering homage to the Sun of RighteousnessŠChristŠand un-.consciously keeping the day of the sun, the first day of the week, thinking all the time that they were in reality keeping the Sabbath of Jehovah. It has been shown in former articles that sun worship was the "oldest, the most widespread, and the most en-during of all" pagan religions, and that God regarded it as being in his sight the most abominable of all. Previous to the coming of Christ, sun worship, bad as it was, was at its worst only the rival of the true wor-ship of God; but after Christ's time gradually, almost imperceptibly, it not only took the place of Christianity, but it was accepted as Christianity. This was the climax; the very "mystery of iniquity." Yet not quite. The reader who is familiar with the history of sun worship will remember that the sun was worshiped under various forms and names. But whatever the form was, it was not that that was worshiped. That but served to remind the worshiper of something else. It would not be strange if this practice should be -continued after this sun-worship had taken the place of Christianity and bore its name. In Roman Catholicism, it is carried out in the images that are erected ostensibly to this or that saint, but .really in perpetuation of the old pagan practice. When Catholics bow down before the images representing some of the dead saints, and even of those representing Christ, and are charged with worshiping and adoring them, they deny the accusation. There is some truth in these denials. They do not worship them; but only that which they represent. Ostensibly, it is Christ and these dead saints that are worshiped; in reality, it is the "Unconquered Sun." In speaking thus of Roman Catholicism, it is not charged that Catholics understand this matter as pre-sented. Indeed, one could hardly expect them to under-stand it in its true light. A.s before stated, it is the "mystery of iniquity." Outside of the Bible it is impos-sible to comprehend it fully. And here they handicap themselves; they cannot receive the testimony of God's Word, as they are forbidden to judge of the sense of Scripture only as it is expounded to them by the Catholic Church, and interpreted according to "the unanimous consent of the fathers." This may be seen from the fol-lowing quotation found in the creed of Pope Pius IY., and to which all Catholics are bound to subscribe:Š "I also admit the Holy Scriptures, according to that sense which our holy mother the church has held, and does hold, to which it belongs to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures; neither will I ever take and interpret them otherwise than according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers."Š"Catholic Belief," p. 251. To a greater or less extent this "Mystery of Iniquity" has prevailed. For a thousand years and over, this papal darknessŠthis Christianized paganismŠhas held sway more or less in every heart. But now the time has come for the truth to be known. Let it be borne in mind always that sun worship was the most abominable in God's sight, and was the great-est rival to the true worship of Jehovah. And let it also be borne in mind that this system, through the papacy, has been perpetuated in some of its forms to this present day. And let it further be borne in mind that Sunday,Šthe "wild solar holiday of all pagan times,"Šis the sign or mark of this great system of false worship; even as the Sabbath of the fourth commandmentŠthe seventh dayŠis the sign of the true God and his worship. But at this time, whenthe light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ is to shine forth with a splendor never before witnessed, not even in apostolic days, it is sought to enforce this mark of sun worship upon the consciences of the peopleŠsought to perpetuate it as Christianity and in the name of Christianity. And this, too, when the chief apostles of this movement know perfectly well that the Bible is utterly silent concerning the observance of Sunday, and that its uniform testimony is, that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and when they know too, or may know, if they will only stop and study, that Sunday was always and only the sign of the most iniquitous worship that ever arrayed itself against the worship of the Lord. And it is because that in spite of this knowledge they persist in this work, which is virtually to put the crea-ture in the place of the Creator, and which in turn is vir-tually to make God to cease to exist (see Isa. 30:11), that the solemn warning of Rev. 14:9-11 is given. RELIGION furnishes the deepest motives of human action.
