664 AMERICAN SENTINEL. not commit adultery." "Thou shalt not kill." These two precepts fence in or guard the sacred rights to fam-ilies and to life. "Thou shaft not bear false witness." This guards the right to reputation, and also to prop-erty. These are rights between man and man. Even so between God and man there are rights. It is God's right to have the supreme love and worship of every human creature, for he made us "for his pleasure," and his pleasure is our love. It is man's right, also, to worship the true God. He must, from his nature, worship something; but who, knowing the true God, with his infinite tenderness and love, would worship idols? God is infinitely above every human conception of him, and he seeks ever to lift us into higher conceptions, and unite us more closely to one another, by uniting us all to him-self. But an image is only a creed in marble, seeking to make permanent the present conception of him, and robbing men of the right to walk in the dawning light. Taking his name in vain, also can do naught but rob that name of its sacredness, and of its mighty power to uplift the soul and set it free. But how shall I in few words speak of the fourth pre-cept? God, who created all things, has a right to set apart and sanctify what he will unto himself. He has chosen to set apart and sanctify the seventh day of each week. He has made it a weekly memorial of the fact that the only God worthy of worship, the only being in the universe who has a right to command the consciences of,  men, is the Creator. All history proves that when men seek to command the consciences of other men, the result is always to enslave the soul, and to bind it in priestly fetters, and tether it to stationary and dying creeds. But God, the Creator, commands the soul but to uplift it and set it free. He who worships the.Creator only finds an infinity of beauty, which he cannot fathom, in every flower at his feet. .Flower, and tree, and earth, and star, and sun, each, made by him, and each touched with his infinity, are so many stepping-stones by which the soul mounts to God, and learns never to confine itself by any creed from learning more of him. Who cannot see that here is the very guard and guide to liberty and freedom, and that all men, had theynot been deceived, and robbed of their rights, would have rejoiced in his holy day? God's law, then, states the very principles of liberty. It marks out the boundary line of right between God and man and between man and man, a boundary line which must be recognized else liberty is impossible to intelligent beings, either in this world or in any other. But while these boundary lines of right must be recog-nized, else liberty is impossible, there is still a kind of slavery in being compelled to recognize them against our wills. So God does not compel us. He made us, and he leaves us freeŠas free to do wrong as to do right, seeking all the while, however, by his infinite love, through the new covenant, to write these principles in our hearts. See Jer. 31 :33; Heb. 8 :10. When that law is written by the finger of divine love, not on tables of stone merely but on the fleshy tables, of the heart, then we with Jesus  can say, "I delight to do thy will, 0 God; yea, thy law is within my heart." When aman is free to do what he delights to do, and delights to "do what will make him free, he has perfect liberty. This is the liberty of the angels, and of all the sons of God. It is the result of the "perfect law of liberty" being perfectly written in the heart. When this is accomplished, all the redeemed will throughout eternity enjoy perfect liberty to do what they please, because they please to do just what is in harmony with liberty and joy. Fruit is an easy growth, the result not of effort and struggle, but of indwelling life. "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law." Gal. 5:22,23. Such are free, and can do the things that they would. See verse 17, compared with verses 22 and 23. "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness" to such as thus believe. Rom. 10:4. The law commands them no more, simply because it is no more an external law. It has become instead the inner, living, actuating principle of the whole being. Ah, then, there is joy and privilege in keeping God's commandments, not duty merely. The good stepmother does her "duty" by the wayward boy. She will not turn him out-of-doors, be-cause she knows people will say, "That is what you might expect of a stepmother," and she has resolved to do her duty. This is obedience to law. Could 'she but wake some morning and know that she was indeed his mother, and feel her heart thrilling with the unspeakable tender-ness of a mother's love, she would be free. Love and privilege would have taken the place of duty. Others might say, "She makes a slave of herself for the child," but she knows that she is enjoying the perfect liberty to do just that which gives her the most pleasure. May it please God to write his perfect law of liberty in all our hearts, that we, too, may be free as he is free. This he will do if we submit to him, saying with Jesus , "Not my will, but thine be done.", Sunday Bicycling in New Jersey. THE latest "turn of the wheel" in the effort to dis-cover the meaning and application of the Sunday law in New Jersey, brings up the discovery that Sunday bicy-cling, so lately discouraged by several court decisions, is right in New Jersey after" all. The law under which it is considered to be justified, is the following, passed in 1893:Š "It shall not be unlawful for any person or corpora-tion, on the Christian Sabbath, the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, to print, publish, and sell newspapers, to sell and deliver milk, or to walk, ride or drive for recreation, and to hire horses and carriages or other conveyance for riding or driving." It ought to be apparent to thinking people that the effort to secure Sunday observance by law only tends to obscurity and uncertainty so far as concerns its applica-tion, and confers no dignity, but rather the reverse, upon law in general.
