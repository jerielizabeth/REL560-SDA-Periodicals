28 THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. CHICAGO, AUGUST 23, 1900. Any one receiving The Sentinel of Liberty without having ordered it, may know that it is sent by some friend. those who have not cirdeted The Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE only crown the world offers to Christ is a crown of thorns: THE Constitution was the natural and logical result of the Declaration. It is therefore natural and logical that the scoffs and sneers at the Declara-tion which have been heard in this country for some time should be followed by repudiation of the Con-stitution. Tx Boston ijerald calls attention to the extra-ordinary financial successes of the legal profesSion Of the day in corporation practice, and then notes the fact mentioned by Tacitus, that the Roman law-yers in many cases acquired great fortunes at a time when the methods by which they were secured "were slowly but surely bringing about the degen-eracy of society, the paralyzation of industry, the complete loss of political liberty and the partial ex-tinguishment of civilization." The inference is not far to seek. THE claim that the national ConstitUtion recog-nizes Sunday by the words "Sundays excepted," where it provides that the President shall have ten days in which to return bills passed by Congress, is a claim thatis made much of, but nevertheless it amounts to nothing-. The Constitution does not recognize Sunday. It does not recognize the day, it recognizes a right--the right of the President to abstain from business on the day he believes in And,  observes as sacred, The Constitution says that ten days shall be allotted the President to consider a bill that comes to him from Congress for his signa-ture or veto before such bill shall become a law of its own force. Unless Sundays were excepted' from these ten days, either the President would be ,ob- liged to work as Usual on Sunday or a less number  of days would be allotted to the consideration of the bill: This is why the Constitution contains tile words in question. The object of the phrase is to secure ten days for the consideration of bills by the President without obliging him to work on Sunday. It recognizes his right to observe the day, but does not recognize the day itself at all any more than legislation exempting- the Turkish ambassador from official business on Would be a recognition of that day in the character claimed for it by Mo-. hammedans. The Constitution is -wholly a secular docunient. " THE United States is [are] the great armed neu-tral of the world," says Senator Davis, of Minnesota. " It will have peace, not as the boon of a suppliant non-combatant, but as the right of a peace-loving, armored, pussiant nation whose rights are secured by its manifest ability to cause other nations to re-spect, them." This is only another way of saying that this na-tion will have peace even if it has to fight for it, and this position is one that always calls for plenty of fighting. THOSE MAPS.
