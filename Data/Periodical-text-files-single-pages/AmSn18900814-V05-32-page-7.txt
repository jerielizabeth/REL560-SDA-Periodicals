HE NATIONAL SUNDAY LAW THIS PAMPHLET CONTAINS THE ARGUMENTS IN BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BLAIR SUNDAY- REST BILL, WHICH MR. JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, DECEMBER 13, 1888. Mr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING." And Mr. Jones' comments make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially Legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is based on Scripture and history, constitution and law, showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-Law Movement of the Fpurth Century, AND THE Sunday-Law Movement of the Nineteenth Century. The Methods Used in Securing Indorsements to the Petition for the Blair Bill, and the Workings of Such Sunday Laws as are Proposed for the United States. The Work Contains 192 Pages and will be Sent Post-paid on Receipt of 25c. Send for it I Read it! Send it to Your Friends! Address all Orders to PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 43 BOND STREET, NEW YORK.
