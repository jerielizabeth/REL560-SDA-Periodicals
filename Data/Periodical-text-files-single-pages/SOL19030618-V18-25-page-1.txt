The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, JUNE 18, 1903 NO. 25 One of the first and highest of duties is to extend to others the rights which ewe claim for ourselves. Instead of being awake to the importance of enforcing a day of rest, "labor" should be awake to the importance and the duty, both to itself and to society, of extending to others the rights which it claims for itself. There is something more important even than the main-tenance of a day of rest, and that is the maintenance of justice and the liberty of the individual, and these latter cannot be maintained if there is to be "enforcement of a day of rest." The Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic, and by so much as the Constitution ceases to be the supreme law to those having authority in and exercising authority for the Republic, the Republic ceases to be. Subordinating the Constitution to the will of Congress at one point under the national jurisdiction is a step towards subordinating it to the will of Congress at all points under the national jurisdiction. "The government of the United States cannot permanently endure part republican and part imperialistic."
