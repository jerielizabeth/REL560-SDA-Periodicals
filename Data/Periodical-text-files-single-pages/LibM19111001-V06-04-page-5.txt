LIBERTY Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inbabitanu thereof. Lev. 25: Vol,. VI  FOURTH QUARTER, 1911 N o- 4               A Striking Object-Lesson in Religious Intolerance The Baneful Effect of State-Churchism on Individual Religious Experience and on Individual Character as Illustrated by Conditions in Russia [The matter which follows is-an epit-ome of a public address given recently by one who has made a close study of conditions in Russia, and who, from residence and travels in other lands, is well able to make an impartial compar-ison between the conditions in that country and in the other countries of the world.Å  ED.] BEFORE going to Russia, I had very little definite information regarding the real situation. I knew that members of denominations other than the Greek Catholic Church struggled against many difficulties and restrictions in carrying forward their work, and that often mem-bers of evangelical bodies are cast into prison merely on account of their re-ligion. During my sojourn in Russia, I sought to become better acquainted with that system which makes Russia a despotism, and outlaws every one who does not be-long to the Orthodox state church. I was told by those who had studied con-ditions there that it is the Russian Church, the union of religion and the state;  which makes Russia a despotic power, and every Christian who does not belong to the state church, a heretic and an outlaw. They told me that if it were not for that system, Russia would  soon take her place among the foremost nations of Europe, arid that self-govern-ment and civil liberty would be granted the people, as they are now in Germany, Scandinavia, and Great Britain. They told me that that mighty church domi-nated the state and everything else within the boundaries of Russia. Russia is a mighty empire, stretching across two continents, Europe and Asia. The northern boundary is the Arctic Ocean, and on the south it extends to the Black Sea and the Caucasus, to the borders of Turkestan and the Chinese empire. The population of this empire is about 15o,000,000, or 6o,000,000 more than in the United States, and ioo,000,-000 more than in Germany. Russia is fully one hundred years be-hind Germany and Great Britain, when, if she could free herself from the domi-nation of a priest government, she might be standing on an equality with them. She might take her place at the head of the nations of earth if it were not for that condition of despotism created and maintained by a system that unites religion and the state. The official title of the Russian church is The Holy Orthodox Catholic Apos-tolic Eastern Church, or Oriental Church. It has a different creed entirely (1053) 3
