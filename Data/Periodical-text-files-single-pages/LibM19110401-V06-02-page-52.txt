ELIGION unfettered by human legislation and uncorrupted by political preferment, should be the ideal held up by every churchman. Just laws, uninfluenced by differ-ences in religious belief, and im-partially bearing upon all, should be the ideal held up by every statesman. When these two great factors in human life Å  religion and law are left free, each to operate untrammeled in its own appointed sphere, the high purpose of each is best served. In sepa-ration each is a power for good. In union, the good that each might do is marvelously lessened, and the direct fruit of the union is evil and oppression, misery multiplied, a form of government that works havoc with character, and a form of religion wanting in power, fruitless in spiritual good, and lacking in vital godliness. 60700 6 6760 07000  L 0 il6) WOO. 767 0 0000-o o o o'676.'0
