248 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry, against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of con-science; and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship ") by compulsory enforcement of the observance of a day which a large part or a majority of the community observe as the " Lord's day," and, in deference to their re-ligious sentiment, by a total prohibition of the natural right to work and labor by all other persons of the same community. Because it is indefinite and uncertain in its description of the acts punishable thereunder, and that the acts intended to be affected by it are not defined or enumerated in it; that no crime is charged or exists except as may be con- ceived in the mind and born of the varying opinions of the magistrates before whom the hearings take place. Because the work performed by the defend- ants, to wit, the publishing of a newspaper on Sunday, is a necessity, and, therefore, within the exception of the act. Because the information is defective in that it does not set out that the work alleged to be done by defendants was not a " necessity or charity," and that no evidence of this fact was offered at the hearing. The act of Assembly upon which these pro- ceedings are founded is an act approved April 22, 5794 (3 Smith Laws, 177), and reads: " If any person shall do or perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, works of necessity and charity only excepted, or shall use, or practise any unlawful game, hunting, shooting, sport or diveriion whatsoever, on the same day, and be convicted thereof, every person so offending shall for every such of-fense forfeit and pay $4, to be levied by dis-tress; or in case he or she shall refuse or ne-glect to pay the said sum, or goods and chat-tels cannot be found whereof to levy the same by distress, he or she shall suffer six days' imprisonment in the house of correction of the proper county, etc., etc. It will be observed that it is a criminal stat-ute, and therefore is to be strictly construed. The Supreme Court [of Pennsylvania] has de-cided that "the act considers a breach of the Sabbath as a crime injurious to society; terms the complaint to the magistrate as accusation, and calls the establishment of the truth of the offense a conviction." It is admitted that on Sunday, March is, 1903, at the County of Philadelphia, the North American, the Press and the Public Ledger, newspapers of general circulation, were pub- lished and sold, and the Commonwealth con-tends that this act was a violation of the act of April 22, 1794, and that defendants should be convicted for such violation. Ordinarily a magistrate would find justifi-cation, if in his opinion evidence warranted it, in convicting a defendant and imposing the statutory fine, or committing the defendant to prison in default thereof, for any violation of the act of 1794, from the fact that for over one hundred years convictions made by magistrates have been approved and sustained in the Court of Quarter Sessions and Supreme Court. The learned, voluminous, new and, in many respects, novel argument in defense of the defendants in the cases before me excuses what might seem like presumption in now giving them careful and due consideration, especially so since the objections to the validity, constitu-tionality and enforcement of the act have never heretofore been presented or passed upon by any court upon the same grounds and in the manner as presented to me. In every case here-tofore construed and adjudicated the point raised was as to the necessity of the work done, except in four or five cases, where the constitu-tionality of the act was attacked by reason of the violation of the spirit of the Bill of Rights, guaranteeing freedom of worship and liberty of conscience. The magistrate here considered at some length the first, and what is of course the most important, point raised by the defense, and to us this portion of the decision is the most interesting and important. But inasmuch as it is impos-sible to present the entire decision at this time we will give here only that portion which dealt with the points that were decided in favor of the defendants, and will reserve for another time the portion. in which the magistrate, " applying the principle of ' Stare decisis,' " and evi-dently against his own personal judgment and opinion, ruled that " as a matter of law [" laid down by the highest judicial authority in the State "] the act does not contravene the third section of Article I of the Constitution." Having ruled thus, the decision continued : We now pass to the other points of defense submitted, viz.: That the act as a criminal stat-ute fails to possess those requirements neces-
