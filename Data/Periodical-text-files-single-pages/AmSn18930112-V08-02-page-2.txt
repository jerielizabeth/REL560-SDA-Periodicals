10 TVI   11-CIIELECA.NT  VOL. 8, No. 2. Sylvania has a population of only 5,000,-000 it is very evident that every man, woman and child in that State were counted three times for Sunday closing, without their consent. . . . " Michigan is toted in with a vote of over 1,000,000 larger than her entire population, and most of the other States are credited with votes that are evidently fraudulent. " These frauds have aroused intense op-position in Illinois, and especially in Chi-cago, and petitions in favor of Sunday opening are being collected everywhere. Notwithstanding the opposition of the church people and the busybodies who are trying to impose their ideas of Sunday on the people, there is good reason to be- lieve that the Fair will be opened on Sun-day." In reference to this and similar articles which are appearing in various papers throughout the country, the Christian Statesman, of December 3, has the fol-lowing to say, editorially :- WORLD'S FAIR PETITIONS AND PETITIONERS. Infidel papers and Sunday papers are republish-ing a charge of contradiction in our statements about World's Fair petitions to Congress, which, as first made by Seventh-day Adventist papers, we did not think it worth while to answer. We ask that the reply now made shall be published as prominently as the charge. The Statesman confirmed, by a detailed state-ment, the accuracy of Senator Hawley's statement, that forty millions of petitioners in the Christian families of this country are represented by the petitions for Sabbath closing at the World's Fair. This is alleged to be contradicted by the statement we quoted from Senator Pettigrew that Pennsyl-vania sent one-fourth of all the signatures since there are not ten millions of people in Pennsyl-vania. But petitions and signatures are not synony-mous and "one-fourth of all the signatures" or "one-fourth of all the petitions" does not mean one-fourth of all the petitioners, as the petitions differ from those representing the vote of a coun-try church of a score of members to a vote of a conference representing millions. In the case of a Methodist General Conference two signatures stand for millions. Another inconsistency is alleged in our state-ment that 150,000 petitions sent out only 10,000 came back when 100,000 might have come. If that be so, says the profound mathematician who edits the Sunday Leader, of this city, only six per cent. of the Christians can have petitioned. But the 10,000 petitions, many of them adopted by church congresses of ministers and laymen acting for whole denominations present the forty mil-lions of whom Senator Hawley and the Statesman spoke. The other petitions were only desired as local ratifications of action taken by national and State bodies, which ratifications were desirable but were felt by many to be unnecessary. They would have increased the number represented scarcely at all, but were somewhat of the nature of ratification meetings after a party convention has nominated a candidate. There were enough of these ratifications to abundantly prove that the action of the church congresses represented faith-fully the substantially unanimous wish of their constituents, not a mere majority of them as does the action of our national Congress. The writer in three years of campaigning, taking the vote of congregations almost daily on these peti-tions, has rarely found a negative vote, though the opportunity is given equally to both sides. The Catholic Church is divided on this question, half its archbishops on each side in the Independent symposium. The Episcopal, Unitarian and Uni-versalist churches also are divided. But the other churches, north and south, have shown themselves united in favor of Sabbath clos-ing to a degree they have never shown in any other movement. We desired the additional peti-tions not to swell the numbers or indicate more clearly the desires of the churches, but rather to emphasize and intensify their demand by 90,000 more amens. Is this a reply ? It is not. If it means anything it is a confession. There are figures which show this to be so, and here they are,-a tabulated statement of the number of petitioners, who have in good faith sent in their actual signatures to petitions asking the Sunday closing of the World's Fair Alabama.

Three hundred and fifteen thousand, nine hundred and fifty-four petitioners for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. This is all. But have they ever mentioned these ? Never ! It was " forty millions of whom Senator Hawley and the Statesman spoke," and fifty millions which Colonel Shepard claimed in Wash-ington, before committees, and in Chi-cago. These inflated figures were ob-tained through resolutions, where, as the Statesman says, " in the case of a Meth-odist General Conference two signatures stand for millions." But so anxious were they for exaggeration that they over-estimated even this one half. The tabu-lated statement of the numbers claimed to be represented by resolutions shows this :- Resolutions Representation claimed.

This is the second time that such tactics have been resorted to by the same men. In this connection No. 19 of the Sentinel Library, " Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts Against the Editors of the AMERICAN SEN-TINEL," pp. 44 to 64, is exceedingly inter- esting and valuable reading. w. H. M. Is the Sabbath Union the "Christian Nation ﬂ? THE last week in November the West-ern Pennsylvania Sabbath Association held its first annual convention at Pitts-burg. A significent incident of its pro-ceedings was the failure of the " Law and Order" attorney, William Yost, to meet his appointment to speak, because, accord-ing to his letter of apology, he had " thir-teen Law and Order appeal cases to hear in criminal court " and could not be pres-ent. This it was said was regretted because he was expected to be "loaded on the Sunday question." Ł The Pittsburg Leader, of November 30, referring editorially to the convention has this to say :- " A contemporary, commenting on the demand of the Pennsylvania Sabbath As-sociation for a `Christian Sabbath,' per-tinently suggests that the term ' Chris-tian' needs a definition at the hands of the association, the present disposition among the Sabbatarians being seemingly to take it for granted that there is but one kind of Christianity and that it is limited to the particular sects which advocate blue law enforcement. " One orator at yesterday's convention said that the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that `this is a Christian Nation and as such the Chris-tian Sabbath should be observed as befits a religious people.' This would be a clincher if the speaker could only have gone on to show that the Supreme Court not only ruled in favor of compulsory Christianity, but indicated the particular sect or group of sects which was to lay down to the people the final interpretation of what is meant by the ' Christian Sab-bath,' which, we are told, it is legally and morally obligatory on all American citizens to observe. " As it is, there is a wide diversity of opinion concerning the manner of observ-ing Sunday. Reformed Presbyterians and some United Presbyterians want everything to come to a standstill except the churches; plain Presbyterians are a trifle milder; Methodists and Baptists are milder still; Episcopalians are liberal and believe in allowing considerable freedom of action to humanity on its `day off;' Catholics are perhaps more liberal than Episcopalians on this question and hold that innocent amusements are permissible on Sunday; Unitarians occupy about the same position as Catholics; Seventh-day Baptists do not recognize Sunday as the genuine ' Sabbath' at all, and other de-nominations entertain a diversity of opin-ions running all the way from the gloomy 8 16,000 1 150,000
