, AMERICAN SENTINEL. 725 others. They cast covetous eyes upon possessions that are not theirs. They never forgive an insult, but demand an apology and satisfaction; and if these are not forth-coming, there is war. Or if war does not follow, it is only because the aggrieved party feels too weak to risk the venture. These are facts which no one can dispute. In the very nature of things, therefore, it is not to be ex-pected that civil governments will long act in harmony with the will of God. And thus, in the light of truths that are self-evident, it is plain to the astonished gaze of every lover of liberty that in the cityof Boulder, Col., in this latest year of Amer-ican progress and enlightenment, the pupils of the public schools are compelled, by the constituted school authori-ties, to profess religion ; to utter, in many cases at.least, a direct falsehood; and to pledge themselves to the serv-ice of a power that is by nature contrary to God; they are forced to do all this under penalty of expulsion from the schools; and this is done in direct contravention of the provisions of the fundamental law of the State, for-bidding any religious test, or forced participation in "any religious services whatever" ! What do the board of public schools of the city of Boulder, Col., propose to do about it? What will the people of Boulder do about it? What will the people of the State do about it? And what will the people of the United States, and of the civilized world think about it? These are things that remain to be seen. Reverence and Patriotism. WE wish it to be understood that we are in entire sympathy with the desire which many excellent people feel, in this country, for the inculcating of a greater degree of reverence in the minds of the young. If there is one feature more conspicuous than another in the lives of the youth in this land, it is their fast grow-ing irreverence for any power and authority higher than themselves. It is perfectly proper that the situation should be viewed by good people with genuine alarm. The spirit of irreverence is essentially the spirit of lawlessness. It is certain that it bodes no good, but great evil, to the future welfare of society and the prosperity of the nation. Something ought to be done, and that as speedily as possible, to check the growth of this baneful feature of our modern civilization; which is, indeed, becoming so widespread a feature of that civilization as to constitute a sign of the times. Everything should be done to this end that can be done by all lovers of good government. And unquestionably there is much that might be done by judicious planning and effort. Our only want of sympathy in all that relates to this matter is with the misconceivedŠthough doubtless well-meantŠefforts that are being made to remedy the situa-tion by people whose views are not broad enough to  take in the full scope of what it demands. Such efforts do not get down to the root of the difficulty, and by their superficial work only aggravate the evil which they are meant to cure. Such, for instance, is the effort which finds expression in the "patriotic salute" innovation in some of the public schools, which is noticed at length on another page. For it is not difficult to believe that a desire to inculcate rev-erence in the minds of the youthful pupils of the public schools is the real motive from which this innovation has sprung. We are heartily in sympathy with the mo-tive; but as we have pointed out elsewhere, we are most heartily opposed to the means through which it is sought to be carried into effect. The trouble is not one which lies with the public school system of education. It is not one which any change in that system can eradicate. It is an evil which lies primarily at the doors of parents. Parents have not taught their children to be reverent toward the things which can of right command their reverence. They have not conducted themselves in a manner to command the reverence of their children; and the latter have grown up to acquire and use such expressions as "the governor" and "the old man," in the place of "father." There can be no real and permanent remedy for the evil until pa-rents take up this long-neglected duty. The influence of the parent upon the child is one which cannot be ignored, and which will produce its effect for good or ili upon the character in spite of any system of public education that can be devised. The spirit of reverence is essentially the spirit of reli-gion. As this spirit has become lost out of the hearts of the people, in the great spiritual declension of these times, the natural result has been the loss of the reverential spirit by those who should be teachers of reverence to the rising generation. We are in the great spiritual declension of "the last days,"Šof the time when, because of abounding iniquity, the love of many should wax cold. See Matt. 24:12, 13 ; 2 Tim. 3:1-4. Without religion, there cannot be rever-ence; and without Christianity, there cannot be rever-ence for that to which reverence rightfully belongs. Christianity, and that alone, will reach the root of the difficulty. The wider diffusion of Christianity is the pressing need of the hour. And there is but one way for this diffusion to be accomplished, and that is by faith in the Word of God. We are also heartily in sympathy with the desire to foster the sentiment of true patriotism in the minds and hearts of the people. But what is patriotism? Is it something which makes people belligerent,Šwhich fills them with the idea that their country can whip any other country on the earth, and with a desire to demon-strate their ability in this line at the earliest opportu-nity? IsŁit an altogether selfish sentiment, which ignores right and justice in the endeavor to gain some advantage for the object on which it is bestowed? If it is, then we have no wish to see it fostered; for there is selfishness
