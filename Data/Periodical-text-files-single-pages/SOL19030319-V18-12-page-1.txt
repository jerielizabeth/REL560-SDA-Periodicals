The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW -YORK, MARCH 19, 1903  NO. 12   PUBLISHED WEEKLY  ONE DOLLAR A YEAR   The Papacy remains, not in decay, not in mere antique, but full of life and youthful rigor. . . . During the eight-eenth century the influence of the Church of Rome was constantly on the decline. . . . During the nineteenth century this fallen church has been gradually rising from her depressed state, and reconquering her old dominion. . . . The number of her children is greater than in any former age. . . . Her acquisitions in the New World have more than compensated her for what she has lost in the Old. . . . Nor do we see any signs which indicate that the term of her long dominion is approaching. She saw the commence-ment of all the governments and all the ecclesiastical estab-lishments that now exist in the world; and we feel no assurance that she is not destined to see the end of them all. . . . We often hear it said that the world is con-,stantly becoming more and more enlightened, and that this enlightening must be favorable to Protestantism and unfavorable to Catholicism. We wish we could think so. But we see great reason to doubt whether this be a well-founded expectation. . . . We cannot feel confident that the progress of knowledge will necessarily be fatal to a system which has, to say the least, stood.  its ground in spite of the immense progress which knowledge has made since the days of Queen Elizabeth. prom  macaulay's essay entitled "Ranke's History of the Popes," published first in October, 1840, in the Edinburgh Review.
