A Plea For Peace. "Present Truth (London, Eng ), Sept. 8. THE one absorbing topic of interest during the past week has been the Czar's manifesto to the nations of Europe, inviting them to meet in a conference and con-sider the question of reducing their armaments. The document points out that such a step would be in conformity "with the most essential interests and legitimate views of all powers;" and credits all the gov-ernments with making peace the object of their inter-national policy. "It is in its name that great States have concluded between themselves powerful alliances; it is the better to guarantee peace that'they have developed in propor-tions hitherto unprecedented their military forces, and still continue to increase them without shrinking from any sacrifice. All these efforts nevertheless have not yet been able to bring about the beneficent results of (the desired pacification." The message goes on to point out the disastrous results of the increasing armaments. "They strike at the public prosperity at its very source." Intellectual and physical strength are unproductively consumed. "Hundreds of millions are devoted to acquiring terrible engines of destruction." "National culture, economic progress, and the production of wealth are either par-alyzed or checked in their development." Nor do these sacrifices give any hope of averting the calamities of war as so many claim. The Czar should know, if any can, whether it be true that the best way of ensuring peace is readiness to fight, and he says:Å  "In proportion as the armaments of each power increase, so do they less and less fulfill the object which the governments have set before themselves. "The economic crises, due in great part to the sys-tem of armaments a outrance and the continual danger which lies in this massing of war material, are trans-forming the armed peace of our days into a crushing burden which the peoples have more and more difficulty in bearing. It appears evident, then, that if this state of things were prolonged it would inevitably lead to the very cataclysm which it is desired to avert, and the horrors of which make every thinking being shudder in advance." When the Czar of Russia speaks on this wise all men listen. It is thought probable that the conference will be held, for no country would care to take the odious initiative of declaring that it did not desire to see the chances of war lessened. But it is not expected that the matter will go beyond a conference. It seems strange, but the first results of the Czar's  message have been to increase the sense of irritation among the nations. France has been reckoning on Russian assistance to recover her lost provinces, and does not want to talk of peace until this has been done. Almost everywhere the message is regarded with sus-picion, and while the idea of increasing the prospects of peace is applauded, and each nation hopes that others will begin soon to disarm, it is felt necessary to make sure that they themselves are not placed at any disad-vantage. Some point out that it would be well for Russia to set an example, but no one believes she will do this. A significant fact is that the stock markets have been unfavorably affected in the four principal financial capitals of Europe. There is but one hope of peace on earth and good will to men, and that is that the peace of God should keep men's hearts and minds. Christ came to bring peace. It is not a natural product of the human heart, for among the works of the flesh are hatred, variance, wrath, strife, murders. The fruit of the Spirit is love and peace. Christ is our peace, and the life that is not yielded to Christ and controlled by him cannot know' peace. "The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked." It is true that the Bible foretells a movement among men in the last days, which will promise peace to the world, and some of the statements which the prophets say will be made at that time have been much in evidence during the last few days. "Many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, . . . and he shall judge among the nations . . . and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks:, na-tion shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Isa. 2. The rest of the chapter shows that in that very time the judgments of God are about to fall upon the world, because men have altogether forsaken him. "Their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots," in spite of their talk of disarma-ment, and not learning war any more. "For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them." 1 Thess. 5:3. The Czar's manifesto is in itself a most ominous sign of the times. Coming whence it does, it shows that the strain on the nations is unendurable, and that things cannot go on as at present. God would save men from the coming destruction, and he has made use of the Czar to set before all clearly the situation and the pros-pect. Let no one be deceived by a false hope of peace and security,'looking for it at the hands of men who are strangers to it. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee." Isa. 36:3.
