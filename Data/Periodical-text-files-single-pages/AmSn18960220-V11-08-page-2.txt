58 CA. IN SP:IN-TIMEX, VoL. 11, No. 8. their possessions this busy mart of the Orient. But hitherto ambition has been restrained by the certain knowledge that the occupation of " Key of the East" by any one of the powers would he the signal for a general European war too awful in its probable consequences to be risked even for such a prize. Nevertheless the conquest of Turkey, the possession of Constantinople, and the com-mand of the passage between the Mediterra-nean and the Black Seas have long been the avowed purpose of Russia. Peter the Great cherished this ambition two centuries ago and left it as a sacred legacy to his successors. In his will, the great Czar said:Š Take every possible means of gaining Constantino-ple and the Indies (for he who rules there will be the true sovereign of the world); excite war continually in Turkey and Persia; establish fortresses in the Black Sea; get control of the sea by degrees, and also of the Baltic, which is a double point, necessary to the realization of our project; accelerate as much as possible the decay of Persia; penetrate to the Persian Gulf; reestablish, if possible, by the way of Syria, the ancient commerce of the Levant; advance to the Indies, which are the great depot of the world. Once there, we can do without the gold of England. How undeviatingly this policy has been fol-lowed by the Czars will appear from an extract from, Russian history :Š In 4696, Peter the Great wrested the Sea of Azov from the Turks, and kept it. Next, Catharine the Great won the Crimea. In 1812, by the peace of Bucharest, Alexander I. obtained Moldavia, and the prettily named province of Bessarabia, with its, ap-ples, peaches, and cherries. Then came the great Nicholas, who won the right of the free navigation of the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, and the Danube. Great as were these advances Russian ambi-tion was not satisfied; and in 1853 the Czar attempted to establish " a protectorate over all Christians in Turkey belonging to the Greek Church. This claim not being allowed by the Port, a Russian army entered the Danubian principalities.- After ineffective negotiations war was declared by the Sultan on the 4th of October." f In this, the Crimean war, England and France allied themselves with Turkey; Russia was defeated and lost some territory pre-vidusly gained; but, in 1870, when all Eu-rope was intently watching the desperate conflict between France and Germany, the Czar announced to the powers that he would no longer be bound by the Tre tty of Paris, made in 1836, which excluded his ships and arsenals from the Black Sea; and since that time the Euxine has been. practically Russian territory. But the long-cherished goal of Muscovite ambition, had not been reached, and only a few years later eastern Europe was again darkened by an ominous war cloud.' Russian intrigue was at work, and in 1875 Bosnia and He,zegovina revolted ; and in a few months Bulgaria was involved in the rebellion. Ser-via and Montenegro also took up arms. The atro ;Wes attending the efforts of the Turks to suppress rebellion were such as to excite the indignation of the civilized world. But the resources of European diplomacy 'were ex-hausted in fruitless attempts to gain from the Porte some real security for better government in the distracted provinces, and in April, 1877, Russia again declared war. The neutrality of Austria had been secured * Abd-ul-Mejid came to the throne by the death of his father, Mahmud IL at the very, moment when Mehemet Ali seemed about to make himself master of the Turkish Empire. Says the "Encyclopedia Britannica," Art. "Turkey ": "The young Sultan entered upon his reign nominally as an inde-pendent sovereign, but really under the protection of the European p ,wers." And again, in the same connection, but of a little later period, it is said of the Czar: "The suppress sion of the National Hungarian Government by Russia in 1849 had heightened in the Emper .r Nicholas the sense of his own p -over. He now looked forward to the speedy extinc-tion of Turkey. and in 1853 proposed to the British ambassa-dor, Sir H. Seymour. a plan for the division of the Sick Man's' inheritance as soon as he should expire " I " Encyclopedia Britannica," Vol. 23, p. 8.51. by .a secret agreement permitting that country to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina, if Russia should extend its influence beyond the Bal-lans. England would doubtless have inter-fered but the Bulgarian massacres had excited such horror and indignation that Britain was forced to remain neutral. Lord Beaconsfield, then Prime Minister,' stipulated, however, that Egypt should not become the scene of hostilities, and that the Russians should not occupy Constantinople, except temporarily. In this way Turkey was left without an active ally, and the following February the Rus-sian army reached the suburbs of the cov-eted city; but the Czar, knowing that England would not permit him to reap the full fruits of his victory, concluded a treaty of peace with Turkey, March 3, 1878, and shortly with-drew his troops from Ottoman territory. As a result of the war, several independent and semi-independent principalities were erected out of what had formerly been Turk-ish territory; and in these, Russian influence continued to manifest' itself. They have been saved from Muscovite greed only by the influ-ence of England and Austria, made potent by English cannon and Austrian columns. Russia had gained the Black Sea,"but could advance into Asia Minor only by aggres-sions in Armenia. To this end revolt was encouraged there, until a few months since open rebellion afforded pretext for Moham-medan hate to manifest itself in the massacre of those who bore the name of Christians. This doubtless was the cause of the atrocities which so horrified the world only a few weeks ago. From a human standpoint, only one thing prevented summary interference on the part of the " Christian " powers, and that was jealousy of each other. But God makes even the wrath of man to praise him, and the re-mainder of wrath he restrains.' Universal war would greatly retard the progress of the gospel, and so God holds in cheek these warlike elements until his work is acconipfished in the earth. HOw often during the past twenty years have Men said, the final catastrophe can be averted 'only a few months Ł at most, then universal, devastating war must come. But heavenly messengers restrain the armies of earth. "I saw four.angels," says the inspired penman, " standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the, earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God:, and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, Say-ing, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads,"' Many times the speedy dismemberment of Turkey has appeared to be inevitable. But though without friends or allies Turkey has received aid either directly or indirectly in every emergency, and has thus been preserved as a— nation.'; but nobody doubts that the time will come, When, having filled up the cup of its iniquity, the Ottoman power will be swept from the face of the earth. To the testimony of the unmistakable trend of political events is added the declarations of the Word of; God. The prophecy declares platrtly that notwithstanding the fact that the Turk, has been supported more or less directly in the past by other powers, he will *ally be driven from Europe. "He shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain," says the inspired Word, "yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him"' Ps. 78:10. 2  Rev. 7:1-3. 9 Dan. 11: 46. "Between the seas in the glorious holy mountain" refers unmistakably to Jerusalem, located between the Dead Sea and the Medi-terranean. Palestine is Turkish territory, and the Mohammedan, equally with the Christian, regards Jerusalem as holy ground. And what is more natural than that driven from Europe and fired by religious fanaticism, the Turk should make the " Citytaf David " his capital? But such a transfer of the Ottoman seat of government will by no means settle the East-ern Question; it will only change its form. Turkish hate and fanaticism will beget like feelings in " Christian" breasts, and Christen-dom will demand the expulsion of the Turk from the " Holy City." "He shall come to his end and none shall help him." And what then? Let the prophecy answer: " And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and eNerlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."' The seal of the book of Daniel has been broken. Knowledge of the Scriptures, as well as of the arts and sciences, has increased won-derfully, and in the light of the divine Word the present status of the Eastern Question points unmistakably to the soon coming of the "King of kings and Lord of lords" to claim the promise of the Father and to fulfill his word: " Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter-most parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."' " And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people pf the saints of the most High, whose kingd( m is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."' And in these events only will be found the final settlement of the Eastern Question. Ł Ł .0. Ł- WHAT THEY WANT. THE " National Reform " conception of the State,Šthe conception upon which Sunday legislation is demanded of Congress and other law-making bodies,Šis that the State is the creature of God, and therefore amenable to God's moral law, Šthat law which says, "Thou shalt have no other gods, before me," " Remember the Sabbath day to keep it hely," etc. But the "National Reform" party do not purpose to abolish or change the form of this Government. They want it to be "Christian" Što be a government of God on earth, but they do not purpose to abolish the various of-fices which are now filled by the people's rep-resentatives. They do not advocate a formal transfer of the government to God, by a gen-eral abdication of office in his favor. They are probably aware that the Almighty would take no notice of any such action; and more-over, it would seriously interfere with their Dan. 12: 1-4. 6  Rev. 19: 16. a Ps. 2: 7  Dan. 7:27.
