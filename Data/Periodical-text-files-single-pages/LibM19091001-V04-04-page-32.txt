THE GREENVILLE (S. C.) COURT-HOUSE, WHERE THE TRIAL WAS HELD N11 32 LIBERTY merely because they observe the seventh day of the week instead of the first as the Sabbath. We called attention to the fact that these godly women and children had been compelled to come to the court that morning through the mud and rain as common crim-inals because a neighbor, filled with religious prej-udice, could take advantage of the existence of a Sun-day law to perse-cute his neighbors. After the plea, the magistrate read a short charge to the jury, and they retired. The jury, after being out for half an hour, re-turned a verdict of not guilty. This verdict was re-ceived with almost universal satisfac-tion and approval by those present.

We submitted that it would be a departure from American jurispru-dence for a magis-trate to sit as a judge and act as prosecutor and ac-cuser at the same time. The magistrate admitted that he did not know of his own knowledge that the defendant had violated the law, but re-lied upon an alleged confession of the defendant, at some previous time, that he had opened his store and sold goods on Sunday. He then said that he would read the law, and if there was anything in that law that would benefit Mr. Brown, he would be glad to have the same pointed out, as he disliked very much to make it unpleasant for him.
