EDITORIAL  97 Eamffacell OF OffffilSTOAIV LlllIBERTit Set for the defense of human rights from the standpoint o Christianity. The only periodical in the United States wholly deboted to exposing and opposing the increasing movements and tendencies of the present time which either directly aim at or logically tend to the employment of the power of law in the domain of conscience, in subversion of the Christian and American principle of complete separation of church and state.

(See close of reading matter for terms of subscription, etc.) DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES. We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ. We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society. We believe in supporting civil govern-ment, and submitting to its authority. We deny the right of any civil govern-ment to legislate on religious questions. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, or not to worship at all if he so chooses. We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to op-pose and prevent religious legislation, to the end that every individual may enjoy the'  inestimable blessings of liberty.

VOL. 17.  JANUARY, 1902.  No. 2. The man who is perfectly free cannot knowingly encroach upon the liberty of another. The enforcement of religious observ-ances is a very poor way to advance the cause of temperance. There is something the matter with that legislation which "protects" days at the expense of human rights. There is no law in the universe which assumes to compel men to rest one day in seven but the Sunday law of human invention. The divine Sabbath law ap-peals to the conscience; it leaves the in-dividual free to say whether he shall heed it or not. When a "civic basis" can be found for a measure which extends special favors to a class of citizens in a matter of re-ligion, invades the sacred precincts of conscience, denies to citizens the most
