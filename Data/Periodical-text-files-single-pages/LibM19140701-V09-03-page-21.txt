This nation is founded on Protestant. principles. This means that all are free to accept or reject religious truth without civil coercion. " God himself per-mits a man to dis-believe, even to blaspheme his holy name ; nor does he abdicate his throne, but rather strengthens his be-ll i g n sovereignty in doing so. This is the sort of reli-gious freedom that loyal Americans stand for." T h e moment the Chris-tian church in-dorses the use of force in propagat-ing its belief, that moment she be-comes a false church. Christianity finds its proper place in man, and not in the government. The existence of s i n and sinners in this world makes nec-essary a liberty that cannot con-sistently be denied by civil or eccle-siastical powers. Men differ ; and as long as they all be-have civilly, the question o f their religious affiliation has nothing whatever to do with their citizenship or their rights to life, liberty, and peace. ttâ€š THE functions which pertain to di-vine institutions should he rendered to Cod and not to' Caesar. If it is proper for Cxsar to compel people to keep the Lord's Dav, then it is just as consistent  for Caesar or the civil government to compel people to observe the Lord's Supper, the Lord's baptism, and repeat the Lord's Prayer. What system of logic or reasoning makes it proper for the state to legislate upon one of the Lord's institutions and improper to legislate upon the other three that have his name prefixed to them? All are purely relig-ious requirements, and the American government, in order to be true to her principles, can never logically and con-sistently enact or enforce religious laws of any kind.
