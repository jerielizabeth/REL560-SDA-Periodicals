THE MASSACHUSETTS HEARING NUMBER PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The erg ins OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, APRIL 2, 1903 NO. 14 t IOdd We admit that religious people may interest themselves in public welfare. We have no objection to churches, or Fellows, or any other body or corporation promoting the public welfare. We welcome their co-operation. But we do object to any body of men saying to us that there is some valid ground for legislation which is not based upon considerations of public welfare, but which is dictated solely by the religious views of a certain portion of the community, even if that portion be ninety-nine hundredths of the whole. ŠJohn S. Ewart, K. C., Winnipeg, Manitoba, Oct. 26, 1902. This claim [that Sunday legislation is not based on religious grounds] is contradicted by the facts of all the centuries. Every Sunday law sprang from religious sen- timent. . . . There is no meaning in the statutes prohibiting "worldly labor," and permitting "works of necessity and mercy," except from the religious standpoint. Every prohibition which appears in Sunday legislation is based upon the idea that it is wrong to do on Sunday the things prohibited. . . . To say that the present Sunday laws do not deal with the day as a religious institution, is to deny every fact in the history of such legislation. The claim is a shallow subterfuge. ŠDr. A. H.
