Sutherland's new book, "Living Fountains or Broken Cisterns, an Educational Prob-lem for Protestants," and I am convinced that it is the book for our churches and our schools. Everyone who reads the book must be convinced that there are now two systems of education one Christian and the other Pagan. The one leading to the knoWledge of God and the other to doubt and infidelity. L. A. AOOPES, Sec. Gen. Conf. Ł Send Your Orders to the - Review and Herald Pub.
