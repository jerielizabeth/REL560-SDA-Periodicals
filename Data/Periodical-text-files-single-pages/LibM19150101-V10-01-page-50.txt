46 LIBERTY News and Comments THE Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call of November 9 gave the following news item : " R. H. Bander, John Mohr, J. C. Race, and Oscar Knappenberger were given hearings on charges of having their places of business open on Sunday, preferred by the local W. C. T. U. The three former were fined $4 and costs, ag-gregating in the neighborhood of $16. The latter appealed to court." Why are these men considered criminals for doing on Sunday what is perfectly proper and legitimate to do on the other six days of the week? The only answer to this question is, They failed to be religious on Sunday. For what is civil on Monday must be civil also on Sunday. The Duluth Daily Herald contained the following news items : " Morris Danuks, proprietor of a store at 52972 West Michigan St., was fined $io and costs in municipal court yesterday for breaking the Sabbath. He sold a hand-kerchief to a plain-clothes policeman last Sunday.-  If we understand the Scrip-tures correctly, they condemn the man who entices a man into sin just as much as they do the man who commits the sin. It seems strange that in America a man is held as a criminal and fined $io if he sells a handkerchief, or a loaf of bread to the needy and hungry, and is looked upon with commendation when he sells a cigar or plug of tobacco to a "tobacco fiend." It is considered unnecessary to sell a loaf of bread to the hungry, but a necessity in the sight of Sunday law advocates to supply the smoker with his cigars on Sunday.
