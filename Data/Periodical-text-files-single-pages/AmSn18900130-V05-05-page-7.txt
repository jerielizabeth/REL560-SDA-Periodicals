Read what others say of it :Š "Many books have been written about the glorious and wondrous story of the Sierras. But it seems to Inc that this scholarly and venerable pioneer who was publishing an illustrated magazine devoted largely to the themes he celebrates, when many of the younger authors were still at their nurse's knee, is the one man who is entitled, by his culture, his fine tastes, and, above all, his long and wonderful experience, to write the one great and responsible authority about the Heart of the Sierras. "ŠJOAQ UIN MILLER "The illustrations, the text, the whole atmosphere of the volume, are worthy of their great subject, the Yo SemiteŠand what could I say more? "ŠREV. JOSEPH COOK. "It is a truthful, interesting, and instructive work."ŠGALEN CLARK, Yo Semite Valley. (For sixteen years the Valley's Guardian.) "As might have been expected, Mr. Hutchings' story of the Valley that he knows and loves so well, is no cold description, but read with all the charms of a romance."ŠSan Francisco Hotel Gazette.

Or OAKLAND, CAL HE NATIONAL SUNDAY LAW THIS PAMPHLET CONTAINS THE ARGUMENTS IN BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BLAIR SUNDAY- REST BILL, WHICH MR., JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR DECEMBER 13, 1888. Mr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING." And Mr. Jones' comments will make it more so, His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, This Treatice will be interesting to all classes, especially Legislators, lawyers. judges, and other public men. The argument is based on Scripture and history, constitution and law, showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-Law Movement of the Fourth Century, AND TH;3 Sunday-Law Movement of the Nineteenth Century. The Methods Used in Securing Indorsements to the Petition for the Blair Bill, and the Workings of Such Sunday Laws as are Proposed for the United States.

OR OAKLAND, CAL. THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 39 ONE of the recommendations adopted by the Paris Interna-tional Sunday Congress, upon " The Weekly Rest Day from a Social Point of View," is this :Š The smallest amount of rest which man ought to have is one day in seven; we mean by that, the Sabbath day, for that which is necessary for man is not a day of relief from labor only, but a day for true moral elevation. If it is a da47-  of rest simply from a social point of view, what matters it which day it is. From a social point of view, one man or a thousand men can rest just as well on one day as another. But that is not what the Congress meant to recommend. The Con-gress " means " that the Sabbath day is the one which shall be ob- served for rest and which is the smallest amount of rest that any man ought to take, and that not for physical rest primarily, but for true moral elevation. In this the Congress abandons the social point of view, adopts the relig-ious, and places the day of rest upon the religious basis, and by so doing, it contradicts itself in its recommendation. But this is not an exceptional case by any means. No argument has ever yet been made professedly from a civil or social point of view that did not in fact rest upon the re-ligious. And no such argument ever can be made. The thing is religious in itself. It cannot be made anything else and by no argument can it ever be made consistantly to appear anything else. REFERRING to the Blair Sun-dayBill now pending in Congress, the Litchfield (Minn.) Independ- ent says :Š We have no hesitancy in giving our opinion that such legislation would be an act of bigotry not worthy this day and age. Let the Government keep its hands off from any interference with the religious conduct of the people so long as the rights of others are not concerned. If the stability of the Christian religion now dominant in this country depends on any bolstering acts like the Blair bill, better let the structure topple at once. 0 A CORRESPONDENT of the World- Herald (Omaha, Nebraska), writ-ing upon the Sabbath question, says :-- "While I am in favor of hav-ing one day in seven to be ob-served as a day of rest, or holi-day, I believe with Martin Luther, that it is wholly wrong to have any law compelling anyone to observe it as a holy day, and all who are sincere in believing such a law to be right do so through the prejudice of education, not from truth, reason and facts,, for they contradict such a thought."
