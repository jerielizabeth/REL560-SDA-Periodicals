' Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Leviticus 25. io. 4,077- .... . The " Mayflower " Under Sail VOL. XV FOURTH QUARTER, 1920 NO. 4 They Builded Better Than They Knew By the Managing Editor 0N a bronze tablet on the Memo-rial Monument at Provincetown, Cape Cod, Mass., is this inscrip-tion, written by Dr. Charles Eliot, presi-dent emeritus of Harvard University : " On November 21, 1620, the ' Mayflower,' carrying 102 passengers, men, women, and chil-dren, cast anchor in this habor, sixty-seven days from Plymouth, England. " On the same day the forty-one adult males of the company h a d solemnly cove-nanted and combined themselves together ' into a civil body politick.' " This body politic established and main-tained on the bleak and barren edge of a vast wilderness a state without a bishop or a priest; a democratic commonwealth, t h e members of which were `straightly tied to all care of each other's good and of the whole by every one.' " With long-suffering devotions and sober resolutions, they illustrated for the first time in history the principles of the religious and civil liberty and the practice of a genuine democracy. " Therefore the remembrance of them shall  be perpetuated in the vast Republic that has inherited their ideals."

The purpose of the Pilgrims was to establish a theocracy, and " the religious and civil liberty " they sought was liberty for themselves, and for others of like faith and practice only.
