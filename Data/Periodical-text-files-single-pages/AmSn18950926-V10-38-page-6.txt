Our Constitution grants to every one the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and yet a large number of Adventists have been asrested, fined and im-prisoned for not keeping Sunday as a holy day, while religiously believing that the sev-enth day, or Sabbath, is the proper day to observe. This outrageous work has been going on a long time, and if allowed to con-tinue, will ultimately overthrow our free American institutions and place us altogether under the dictation and control of the partic-ular church or denomination having the greatest number of voters. We believe in freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and particularly in the right to live according to the teachings of the Bible as we understand it. The sooner Church and State are eternally divorced, the better for all concerned. Not What our Forefathers Intended. [Kingston (N. Y.) Daily Freeman, July 17.] IN Rhea County, Tenn., eight leading members of the Seventh-day Adventists are in a chain-gang because they labored in the fields on Sunday, in violation of the law of the State. All of these persons are devoutly re-ligious, but they observe Saturday instead of Sunday as a holy day, and are persecuted by other Christians in consequence. It was the intention of the founders of this nation to guarantee perfect religious liberty and to make certain that no persons, in however small a minority, should be persecuted on account of their theological views, but for some reason the plan has miscarried. "Glaring Injustice." [Mystic (Conn.) Press, July p6.] LARGE numbers of newspapers throughout the country, both secular and religious, have commented upon and condemned the glaring injustice of this persecution of honest and conscientious Christian men for the sole of-fense of laboring on Sundays, while they have conscientiously and religiously obeyed the strict letter of God's law and remembered and kept the seventh day as the Sabbath, and at the same time allowing men, and whole classes of men, of any or of no religious belief, to work on Sunday without reproof or prosecu-tion. On the other hand, a few newspapers, in-including five Baptist religious weeklies, have defended the action of the Tennessee authori-ties. Shame on such laws; on the men who take advantage of them to persecute their brethren; and on those co-religionists of Roger Williams, who haveŁ so far degenerated as to defend such persecution, thus repudiat-ing the soul-liberty of which he was the dis-tinguished apostle. Our Liberty Threatened. [Lamar (Col.) Sparks, July 25.] THE California Voice approves of the im-prisonment of Seventh-day Adventists in Ten-nessee because they observe Saturday instead of Sunday as the Sabbath. . . . The editor of this paper is very far from being an Adventist, but we do believe that their imprisonment for conscience' sake is in direct conflict with 'the fundamental law of this Republic, which guarantees to all men the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences. It would  seem that, according to the Voice's logic, minorities should be compelled to surrender their religious convictions at the demand of the majority. Such a doctrine enforced would prevent all reform. It would have suppressed Luther, and Knox, and Wesley, and Phillips, and Garrison, and Sumner. It was the effort to enforce this rule that drove the Pilgrims to this country, imprisoned and hanged Quakers, and filled the past with cruelty, persecution and blood. When majorities arrogate to themselves the right to say to minorities, " You have mis-guided consciences in religion, and if you don't worship God in the manner we prescribe, we will put a ball and chain about your ankles and shut you up in prison," then is the very foundation of religious liberty attacked, and the crowning glory of this Republic threat-ened. Governmental Tyranny. [Laurensville (S. C.) Herald, July 26.] IF we are to allow ourselves to believe that it is religion to take up and convict and sen-tence to the chain-gang the members of that religious sect known as Seventh-day Advent-ists, simply because, in their belief, they are not commanded by God's Word to keep the sabbath day holy, we certainly have a very narrow conception of what is commanded of us. There is something so utterly deceptive in such thought that the solitary fact that these people can cite Bible authority in justi-fication for their keeping holy the seventh day of the week instead of the first day, ought at least to protect them from governmental tyr-anny. Much stress has been laid upon the fact that our republican form of government is so liberal that from its foundation it was decreed that there should be no established form of religion, the object being to forever prevent the union of Church and State. . . . Notwithstanding this mandate of our Consti-tution, the signs of the times betray a dispo-sition to consummate this union of Church and State; but when such degeneracy does take place, the Church, which should be the bride of Christ, becomes the harlot of king, priest and politician. In fact, this union is already consummated in United States Court decisions, thus placing Christ upon a civil throne, contrary to his declaration, " My kingdom is not of this world." So now we see religions laws that came down from the Church and State polity of England, stringently enforced, and godly men fined, imprisoned, worked alongside of negroes in the chain-gangŠand all for dissenting from popular opinion. Shall the ruling party or the majority intrude their religious beliefs into the realm of civil affairs ? Many will say no; but the thing is being attempted all the same. We don't want to see any religious law incorporated into the new Constitution. Those Seventh-day Adventists are just as much entitled to their religious belief as were the Huguenots or the Scotch Dissenters, and the spirit of the Constitution never intended that the Seventh-day Adventists or any other religious sect should be persecuted for enjoy-ing their religion. Send Missionaries to Tennessee. [Brooklyn Eagle, August 28.] IF missionaries are needed anywhere in this wide world at the present moment, they are needed in Tennessee. Certain good Christians in that State have decided that the religious doctrines held by the Seventh-day Adventists are wrong, particularly that feature of their  creed which recognizes the dictum of the Bible as to resting on the seventh day. The Adventists rest on Saturday, like the Jews, and work on the other days. That displeases the very pious people, for . . . the people of Tennessee are pious and can make as much noise at their protracted meetings as if they were operating a boiler factory. So they have indicted the men who reserve Saturday for their worship, and have sent them to jail and put them in the chain-gang to work on the roads. Tennessee roads need working on, and need it badly, but not by men and women whose offense is that of rec- ognizing the Jewish SabbathŠthe Sabbath prescribed in the Bible. Nothing has been charged against the Adventists other than that they worked on the day their fellow-citizens, who are Methodists and Presbyterians and Baptists, went to church. The perse-cuted families are non-combatants; they have founded a school that far surpasses the average and infrequent public school of the State, and they neither preach nor practice anything that the sternest moralist might disapprove. Divested of its legal flummery, the charge that has made them prisoners at hard labor is that their religious belief differs from that of their neighbors. This is a direct defiance of the Constitution of this country. It is a defiance of the spirit of the age. It is an outrage on the rights of the individual. It is setting up a religious hierarchy in a land that has jealously preserved its liberties from that sort of encroachment. It is commanding obedience to forms of faith that are not con-fessed by millions of residents of our country, and that will presently fall into disrespect if they have to be championed by such people as the community in Tennessee that has sent the Adventists to jail. Far better that we have no religion than that its professors shall assume the temporal power which the world flung off in the Middle Ages, and shall use that power to torture, to distress, to malign and unjustly entreat a class of their fellow-men who are merely trying to live their lives in usefulness and peace. If such outrages as this are to be perpetrated in the name of a Christian sabbath, then away with the sabbath and all its observances. Tennessee needs schools, it needs newspapers, it needs less law, it needs missionaries who will instruct in the difference between the Christian religion as it was practiced and pro-mulgated by its FounderŠa religion all toler-ance and love and practical goodness, and that religion as it is enforced by fanatics who are backed by outworn, injurious and unconstitu-tional laws. Do not send missionaries to China while these poor creatures with dark-ened minds are seeking the injury of their fellow-beings for a quibbling and inconsequent difference in belief. THE SENTINEL has always insisted that the laws against the sale of liquors on Sunday were designed, not so much for protection of the people against the evils of the liquor traf-fic, as for the protection of the so-called Chris-tian sabbath. That we are correct in this is shown by a remark in the Christian Statesman of the 31st ult. : " Sabbath laws need enforce-ment against the excursion as well as against the saloon." The fact is that if the Sunday-law advocates had their way it would be im-possible for the masses of the people to go anywhere on Sunday except to bed or to church. The thousands who see the country only on Sunday would see it no more. And the hundreds of thousands to whom the cheap Sunday excursions is a real boon, and who are for six days of the week confined in hot, crowded offices, shops and factories, would be
