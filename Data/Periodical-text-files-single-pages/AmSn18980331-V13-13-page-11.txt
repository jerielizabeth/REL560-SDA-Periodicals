AMERICAN SENTINEL. 203 The Difference. A Lurr LE boy, who in the course of some conversa-tion of his elders, heard a good deal of talk about the progress of civilization, approached his grandfather, who was taking no part in the talk. "Grandpa," said the child, "what is the difference be-tween civilization and barbarism?" "Barbarism, my boy," answered the old man, "is killing your enemy with h hatchet at a distance of a step, and civilization is killing him with a bombshell twelve miles away!"ŠYouth's Companion. Studies in French History.-15. "WHAT puzzles me is," interrupted Joe Palmeter, "why the pope had any more right to interfere with the. government of kingdoms than anybody else. I thought he was the head of the church." "So he was," said Professor Carman. "But this did not satisfy him. So he wished to unite church and state, and be the supreme head of both. He evidently thought that all the kingdoms of the earth were his, to keep or to give away, just as best suited him. Accordingly, he next offered the throne of Aragon to Philip III." "Was he the same as Philip the Bold?" asked Florence Ray, writing busily in her note book. "Yes; Philip III. was called the Bold, and reigned during the years 1270-1285. He was not as tender of conscience as his kind-hearted father, Saint Louis, and so he raised an army and went down into Spain, in conform-ity to his ambitious vanity, where he fell a miserable victim to the dreadful climate and died. His son, named after him, Philip the Fourth, and known as the Fair, took the reins of government at the age of only seventeen." "I wonder why he was called the Fair," said Milly Brown. "Was he a handsome man, professor?" "Yes, he had a handsome face, indeed, but that was all one could say in his favor. He was a coldhearted, ambitious man, and perfectly unscrupulous in his manner of getting money. He did the dreadful thing which peo-ple call debasing the coin,Šthat is, he caused inferior metal to be put into the gold and silver,Šand then when anybody was owing him, he obliged them to pay him pure coin. The people were in this manner cruelly op-pressed. The workings  of the Feudal system yet gave  the poor people no end of trouble. The rich nobles had the poorer people who were under them almost entirely in their power, and it was with an iron hand that they held them, and ground them down. The poor wretches were as much real bondsmen as were ever the unfortunate and downtrodden slaves of our own country, and as much needed a noble Lincoln, with his ' Proclamation of Emancipation.' Sometimes the nobles would compel their vassals, after working hard all day, to sit up all the long night, and strike the surface of the pond near their fine castles with whips to quiet the croaking of the frogs, so that the slumbers of the fine lords and ladies should not be disturbed." "I wonder if they laid awake all night to see if the frog stillers did their duty," laughed Milly Brown. "I would never have done it!" exclaimed Rob Billings, with emphasis." "Well, then, you would likely have received a severe punishment. It would hardly have paid you alone to resist. But the reckoning time was coming when the cruel aristocracy would reap what they had sown. "Philip IV. was an extravagant man, and was very expert in extracting money from the Parliament of France Šwhich was much the same as our Supreme CourtŠand was considered by Philip as only a means by which he could wring money from his wretched people. He made all sorts of cruel laws to regulate even the very diet of his subjects, and the kind of clothes they should wear. He forbade their eating more than one dish of meat at their dinner, and so, as the French people were much the same as now, quite fond of good things to eat, they tried to avoid the letter of the intolerant law by heaping several kinds of meat on one dish." "I should think that somebody would have acted the spy, and told Philip," said Florence Ray. "Yes, he did soon find it out, and he put a stop to it at once. Even the trimming on the ladies' dresses was regulated by the word and will of the tyrant." "Perhaps that would be a good plan nowadays," suggested Julia March. "No, indeed! it is not the business of any king, presi-dent, or congress to interfere with anybody's personal conduct in such matter4," said Joe Palmeter, stoutly. "Do you agree with me, professor?" "I certainly do, Joseph," said the teacher, "though I have no doubt there is many a dollar unwisely spent for such purposes. "The common people were forbidden to own a car-riage, or to wear gold or jewels. You see they were not allowed to spend their money as they liked, after they had earned it. But the king's word was law, and no one said anythingŠaloud. "In the reign of Philip, there was a very peculiar fashion in shoes, which raged quite extensively. The king was not satisfied without having his say about this queer fashion also, and so the length of a man's title could be determined by the length of his shoes. A plain, ordinary man must not wear his shoes more than twelve
