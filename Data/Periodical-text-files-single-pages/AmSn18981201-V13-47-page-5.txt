AMERICAN SENTINEL. 745 to acquire property" ! No American history that we have yet seen intimates that they were not at the time freely acquiring property in proportion to their business ability to do so, or that Great Britain ever attempted to interfere with them in this pursuit. What history does affirm in this matter is that Great Britain proposed to tax the American colonies without allowing them political representation in parliament; which meant that she proposed to govern her American colonies with-out their consent. The colonies stood for the principle of government by the consent of the governed; and to affirm this principle before the world they put forth the Declaration of Independence, declaring in it, as self-evident truths, that all men are created equal, endowed by creation with certain inalienable rights, and that to preserve these rights is the only legitimate purpose of civil government. To say that all this, and the long struggle which followed, were for the purpose of vindi-cating their "right to acquire property," is not only to set aside plain historical facts, but to cast contempt upon the Declaration of Independence and its signers, and to rob that document of all the meaning which has made it glorious in American history, and marvelous in the estimation of the world. If the Declaration of Independence does not affirm the consent of the governed to be a primary requisite of just government, it does not affirm anything, and might as well be cast aside as a hypocritical play upon words. This bulwark of American rights and liberties is now boldly attacked by the champions of imperialism for the sake of new possessions abroad; and in doing this, they of necessity sweep away the safeguards of liberty and justice at home. 4- I.- Ł -4 -4 "God Not for the Catholics." BY JOHN MC CARTHY. AN article with the above heading appeared in a very important Spanish journal, El Diluvio, published in the great Iberian educational center,Barcelona. It reads:Š "It is a great truth, manifested hundreds of times over, that God is not for the Catholics. If anyone should doubt this, the reverses which Spain is suffering in war with the great Protestant American Republic, prove in the most eloquent manner that God has aban-doned us to our own fortune; which is the fortune of a dog. "It happens then, that in the war with the United States, we have come off defeated, because God has so ordained; and in good orthodoxy there is no need to point to this one or that as being responsible for the ca-tastrophe. God has so wished it; and he has his reasons for subjecting us to this new trial. "Nevertheless we are forced to recognize that the Catholic nations are very unfortunate, and carry upon their shoulders the worst shadow of the world. During  the past 100 years all has been lamentations and heart-breaks, sorrow and bitterness for the Roman Catholic nations; while on the contrary prosperity, good fortune, and well-being has followed the Protestants and here-tics. "Spain fights against Protestant England, and Spain comes out of the conflict defeated. She fights against Catholic France with an allied army, composed of nearly all Protestants, and Napoleon is conquered upon the fields of Waterloo. A war is declared between Catholic Mexico and the Protestant United States, and but little lacked for preventing the entire disappearance from the map of the world of that new and growing Mexican na-tion. "War is again decreed, this time between Catholic France and Protestant Prussia, and the Protestant army besieges Paris. Again the war hounds are let loose, this time between heretical Turkey and the Catholic schismatic Greece, and the Turks come triumphant even unto the historic pass of Thermopyl. And ultimately the very Catholic Spain essays to fight the Protestant American Republic, and already the reader knows what she has done to us. "It is in vain that our archbishops and bishops have blessed the Spanish flags and armies; it is in vain that they have offered public devotion to the virgin. God has not heard us; all, all has been for the enemy; fatal doom! doleful gate! "It is, I rt peat the evil shadow that follows the Cath-olic nations. For the Protestants everything is felicity and prosperity; and notice that even the rebellion against ancient ideals is a cause of success. "To the religious Reformation of the 16th century England owes the growth of its power and its progress,  in the days of modern civilization. The same causes pro-duced analogous effects in Germany, Switzerland, Hol-land, and other northern countries. "Italy realized its national unity, thanks to the anti-Catholic spirit of its cities; delivered as they had been for so long to the foreign yoke, because of the selfish inter ests of the "popes;" and if Catholic Austria has saved itself up till the present, she owes it to the great effort by which she broke the concordat which bound her to Rome, and gave in time religious liberty to the Austrians, recov-ering at the same time for the state attributes, until then hidden away beneath the cloak of the papish ecclesiasti-cal court. And France is the second nation of the world since it has turned heretic. "In exchange, the very Catholic Spain is almost at the point of passing the pantheon of extinguished na-tions: The Catholic Stuarts lost their crowns in England and Scotland. Ireland and Poland lost their indepen-dence; while the Bourbons have lost nearly all their thrones:Šviz., that of France, and of Naples, of Parma, and of Modena. Only that of Spain remains to them. "I have said, the evil shadow is girthed about the Catholic nations. It is like the shadow of the manchin-ille; which permits not to enjoy the sun's ray, but kills instead. "We have to die, that pleases me; still, nevertheless, it is not good to precipitate events. It is better to die of apoplexy than to die of Anmmia. "So as not to die dl anmmia, one has to give much iron to the body; and thus debilitate the enemy, inas-much as the weaker the enemy is, the less influence is he-
