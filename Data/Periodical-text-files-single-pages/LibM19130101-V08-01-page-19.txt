LIBERTY 17 " First Dogmatic Constitution of the Church of Christ," published " in the Fourth Session of the Holy Ecumenical Council of the Vatican," July 18, 187o, absolute and entire obedience must be rendered to the Pope not simply in matters purely spiritual, but in any matter which he may think relates to the welfare of the church. Note the language of the constitution : Š Hence we teach and declare that by the ap-pointment of our Lord the Roman Church pos-sesses a superiority of ordinary power over all other churches, and that this power of jurisdic-tion of the Roman pon-tiff, which is truly epis-copal, is immediate ; to which all, of whatever rite and dignity, both pastors and faithful, both individually and collectively, are bound, by their duty of hier- archical subordination and true obedience, to submit, not only in mat-ters which belong to faith and morals, but also in those that apper-tain to the discipline and government of the church throughout the world. Pope Pius IX con- demned as an error the claim that " the church ought to be separated from the state, and the state from the church; " 1  and Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical letter Libertas Prcestantissimum, dated June 20, 1888, mentioned " that fatal Syllabus of Errors, Dec. 8, 1864, prop. 55. principle of the separation of church and state." Furthermore, the same Pope in his encyclical letter Longinque Oceani, Jan. 6, 1895, dealing with Catholicity in the United States, defined the papal position with much clearness : Š The church amongst you, unopposed by the Constitution and government of your nation, fettered by no hostile legis-lation, protected against violence by the common laws and the impartiality of the tribunals, is free to live and act without Copyright by Clinedinst, Washington ARCHBISHOP BONZANO
