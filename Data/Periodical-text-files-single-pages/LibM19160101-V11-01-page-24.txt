22 LIBERTY guage of Judge Caldwell, in case of Swan vs. Swan, 21 Fed. Rep., page 305: "It would be downright hypocrisy for a court to affect to believe that the moral sense of a community would be shocked by compelling a man to pay a note given for an honest debt because it was executed on the Lord's Day." And the same is true of the enforcement of any contract. Among the authorities elsewhere which hold in accordance with our decisions that a note or contract made on Sunday is valid, are Bar-rett vs. Aplington, Fed. Cases, No. 1045; More vs. Clymer, 12 Mo. App., II ; Glover vs. Cheatham, 19 Mo. App., 656; Sanders vs. Johnson, 29 Ga., 526; Dorough vs. Mort Co. (Ga.), 45 S. E.

Va., 371; Clark Con-tracts, 395; and there are others to same pur-port. . . . To sum up the whole matter, the validity, in the courts, of any act done on Sunday de-pends not upon religious views. . . . As was said in State vs. Rickett's, supra, " What reli-gion and morality permit or forbid to be done on Sunday is not within our province to de-cide." Judge Clark presiding and rendering opinion. Judge Walker concurred in results. Filed March 29, 1904. ItE of uE What Constitutes Disturbance? C. P. BOLLMAN THE Sunday law of Arkansas provides that " no person who from religious be-liefs keeps any other day than the first day of the week as the Sabbath shall be required to observe the first day of the week, usually called the Christian sab-bath, and shall not be liable to the pen-alties enacted against Sabbath breaking; provided, no store or saloon shall be kept open or business carried on there on the Christian sabbath ; and provided further, no person so observing any other day shall disturb any religious congregation by his avocations or employments." Recently in that State one " who from religious beliefs " keeps another day, was arrested while picking peas on Sunday, and was taken before a magistrate for examination. After some questioning, he was reprimanded, and discharged with a caution. He of course urged that he was exempt under the statute, since, as he understood the law, he was not dis-turbing any individual, much less " any  religious congregation." But the con-stable who made the arrest said to him, " I will be disturbed as soon as I know you are working on Sunday." This reminds us of the story of a good woman who complained to some Sunday ball players that they disturbed her by playing on the block adjoining her house. The players then removed to another va-cant lot several blocks away. But by going upstairs and using her opera glasses the good woman could still ob-setve the game, and again she complained that she was disturbed. Of course the disturbance was wholly mental. She felt that playing ball on Sunday was wicked, and her moral sense revolted against it. This lady's state of mind was similar to that of certain of the Puritans in co-lonial Massachusetts. The king of Eng-land ordered that one of the chapels in Boston be opened for worship according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. This order was bitterly resisted by the
