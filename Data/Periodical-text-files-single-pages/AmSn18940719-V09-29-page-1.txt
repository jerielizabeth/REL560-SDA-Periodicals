"If any Man Hear My Words, and Believe not, I Judge him not: for I Came not to Judge the World, but to Save the World."  VOLUME 9. NEW YORK, JULY 19, 1894. NUMBER 29.        American Sentinel.

SINCE Easter Sunday last, the attention of the people of the United States has been stirred, watching the armies of the " Industrials," the strikers and their con-sequent violence, and the calling out of armed troops because of the troubles in a connected line of States reaching from the Pacific to the Atlantic,Å California, Ore-gon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyo-ming, Colorado, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Seeing these things carried on so continuously, every man is asking his neighbor, " What does this mean ?" " What is to be the end of this matter ? " THESE things are not meaningless; they are full of meaning in many more senses than one, but there is one meaning that they have above all others. And, seeing these things that everybody sees, let us inquire at the, source of all truth, what they really do mean; for if the Word of God has spoken on these things and told us anything as to what they mean, then we may be certain of that meaning, what-ever other meaning may be in it all. And the' Scriptures have spoken in more than one place, describing the condition of things which is now before the eyes of all people, not only of the United States, but of all the world. Turning first to James, fifth chapter, there is the description of a time, and a condition of affairs, in which the' rich are afraid of what is coming, and hold to-gether their treasure in heaps in which the gold and silver is cankered; while on the other hand, there is a cry of the laborers against the rich, and of real dis-tress, indeed, because their wages are kept back; and while these are in distress and are crying out because of it, these same rich ones are nourishing their hearts and living in pleasure and wantonness. Now any one can see plainly enough  that this exactly describes the situation as it is all over the United States to-day; and every one knows that this situation has been brought about by precisely the meth-ods here described. There is certainly no room for any difference of opinion in this. The strife between the laborers and the rich, between " capital and labor," has been brought on by the insatiable desire of those who are already rich, to gather together all that was possible. Men whose income has been a million a year, when there was any sign that that income might be lessened a little, would cut down the wages of the laboring men a few cents more or less all around, while in most cases these wages were already so low that they would no more than supply the neces-saries of life. Now it is hardly too much to suppose that a man with an income of a million could subsist on a half or three quarters of a million a year, or such a part of a year as might tide over a period of busi-ness depression, thus allowing the balance of the million income to remain in pay-ment of the wages of laborers. If all the wealthy men of the country had done this from the beginning, there would to-day be no more of a contest between capital and labor, no more of a cry of the laborers against the rich, than there would be a cry of the earth against the rain. FOR more than a year there has been all over this land a continuous cry of " hard times," caused by the scarcity of money, while, as a matter of fact, all this time there has been more money in this country than ever before. In the summer of 1893, when so many banks were closed, and when there was the greatest " scarcity of money," there were hundreds of mil-lions of dollars simply on deposit in the banks of New York City alone, to say nothing of the other great cities of the country. The trouble is not that money is scarce in itself, but what there is is hoarded, and it is this hoarding of the money that makes the scarcity. And being so hoarded, the money is cankering. In the month of May, 1894, some workingmen in a money vault, employed in recounting the money there, were in danger of being drowned in a flood of silver of which the canker had eaten  up the strong sacks in which it was stored. Money that can have a chance to circulate will never canker; but to-day, although there is so much money, it is hoarded and held so closely together it can only canker. And this Word says that the cankering of it will be a witness against those who have so hoarded it and held it back from circulation while the cries of distress are heard throughout the land. AND those who have the money so hoarded, even as this Word also says, are living in pleasure and even wantonness. And when a woman will give a grand reception, costing hundreds of dollars, in honor of a dog,* while almost within hearing from her doors are the cries of hungry people, certainly such a course is fitly described as " wanton." This may be an extreme case; but admitting that it is, it is only an extreme case in a long series of like though perhaps not identical wantonness on the part of the over rich. And yet it is said that " capital is shy" and will not venture forth when there is so much disturbance and such an unset-tled state of public affairs generally. But if this capital would only venture forth in legitimate investments, instead of ventur-ing so much in selfish pleasure, and such wantonness as giving grand receptions in honor of dogs, there would be no such unsettled condition of affairs as would cause capital to be afraid to venture in legitimate and beneficial enterprises. This is not, however, in any way to sanction or excuse the violence that so largely attends the laborers' side of the controversy, any more than it is to sanction or excuse the wantonness of the rich. HOWEVER, we are not discussing the question of capital and labor, or their relations or antagonisms, we are simply inquiring of the Scriptures, What is the meaning of the present condition and course of things ? And every one knows that the foregoing statements exactly de-scribe the situation as it is. Well, then, this being the situation as described in this scripture, what does the scripture say as to the time when this shall be ? This same scripture answers plainly that this was to be in the "last days." And every- * This was actually done in the winter of 1893-94, in this city.
