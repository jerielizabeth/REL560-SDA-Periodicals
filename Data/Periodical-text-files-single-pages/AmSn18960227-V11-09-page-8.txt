IVEIEria Sla4INTrr IN EJLA V °L. 11, No. 9. Pr" ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE National Reformers never were so active as now in circulating petitions and lit-erature. WHAT are you doing to circulate the AMER-ICAN SENTINEL, the only paper wholly devoted to the advocacy of religious liberty ? MORRIS SEIFMAN, an expressman, of 79 Mott Street, this city, was arrested, Sunday, February 16, for marking his license number on the side of his wagon. The next morning the police justice refaced to hold him. Ł EVERY friend of liberty of conscience ought to be alert now. It is not enough to feel within one's own bosom love of liberty and opposition to despotism. The duty of the hour is to warn others of the impending danger. THE Catholic Review complains that " a 'Baptist minister is employed in the public university of Cincinnati to expound the Prot-estant version of the Bible," and sarcastically adds: " This is an evidence of the unsecta-rianness ' of some of our public schools." WE invite the special attention of our read-ers to the article on page 68, by Mr. Chas. E. Buell, Chief of Division of Church Statis-tics in the Eleventh United States Census. Mr. Buell's intimate acquaintance with the facts which he states gives his article great value. THE Virginia Sunday bill, discussed in these columns two weeks ago, will probably not be heard of again this session. It was killed in committee by a judicious application of the principles of civil government, so ably enunciated a century ago in that State by Jefferson and Madison.' JUST as we close this paper, we are in re-ceipt of a' note from the President of the International Religious Association, stating that the case of Ira Babcock, accused of vio-lating the North.  Carolina Sunday "law," and which was to have been tried at Greens-boro, Thursday, the 20th, was postponed by the prosecuting attorney to the 22nd'inst. The defendant requested that the case be al-lowed to go over to the following Monday,' as he had conscientious scruples against appear-ing on the seventh day of the week. The State solicitor replied: " I don't care a con-tinental for your conscience; you will have to come." The Sunday conscience is such a  tender thing it must be carefully guarded even to the extent of prohibitiug work on that day by those who keep the true Sabbath, while the Sabbatarian is required to stand,  trial on the day which he holds sacred to rest and worship. And this in a land that boasts of religious liberty! SOME of our readers, having in mind only Luke 2:4, are troubled about the reference to the " City of David," in our article of last week on the " Eastern Question." Such are respectfully referred to 2 Sam. 5: 6-9; to Smith's " Bible Dictionary," Art. " City; " and to the " Schaff-Herzog Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge," Arts. " Jerusalem" and " Jebus." The term applies to that par-ticular part of Jerusalem, which was for cen-turies the stronghold of the Canaanites and which " was," as Schaff says, " conquered only by David, who made it his capital." A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD boy, a helper in a barber shop at 221 Third Ave., this city, was arrested on the 16th inst. for violation of the Barbers' Sunday " law." The shop had been closed to customers at 1 o'clock, P. M., as the statute requires. The proprietor, however, decided to shave himself., and called the boy to lather his face. While this operation was in progress a policeman peered in, and seeing this violation of the " law" in progress, de-manded admission. He was admitted, and arrested the boy! The next morning, in the police court, the youthful " criminal," who had been looked up all night, was discharged. THE episode of the forcible removal of Commander and Mrs. Ballington Booth from the leadership of the Salvation Army in America, lifts the curtain from the despotism which, clothed in religious garb, sits en-throned in that organization. The absolute subserviency of the " army " workers in every grade to the will of their superiors, and the autocratic sway of " General" Booth over the whole, have probably no parallel in any relig-ious organization outside of the order of the Jesuits. Such subserviency to man is con-trary to gospel freedom. There can be right-fully no absolute surrender of the will in all things to any being save God himself. God is the only being who does not take advantage of such a surrender, or to whom it can be xnade without any resulting despotism or bondage. And this is because God is not only infinitely powerful, but infinitely wise and good. THE Monitor (Roman Catholic) says: " British Guiana was once a Catholic country. It is now cursed with penal anti-Catholic laws. Its neighbor, Venezuela, thoroughly Catholic, the bishopric of Caracas dating from 1530, permits perfect freedom of conscience." It should be remembered in this connection that Cardinal Gibbons defines religious liberty thus : " A man enjoys religious liberty when he pos-sesses the free right of worshiping God ac- cording to the dictates of a right conscience, and of practicing a form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God." Then, too, it should be remembered, that the Roman Catholic Church claims the exclusive right to educate the conscience so that it shall be " right," and to say what form of religion is " most in accordance with his duties to God." In short, Rome calls the privilege of being a papist religious liberty! RECENT advices from Lake County, Tenn., inform us that three Seventh-day Adventists are under indictment there for Sunday work, and will be tried the second week in March. Thus far, only one man has been arrested, namely, J. W. Lewis, whose arrest was noted in these columns nearly three months ago. A ROMAN CATHOLIC paper notes the fact that the Catholic inmates of the Old Peni-tentiary at Columbus are compelled to attend the Protestant religious exercises every Sun- day morning conducted by a Methodist min-ister, and adds: " Yet our neighbors tell us that they uphold religions liberty and that the separation of Church and State is a fun-damental American principle." Of course it is a violation of religions liberty to compel even convicts to attend religious services against their will; but our papal friends are about the last ones who have any right to complain of it. Even to-day, in countries where she has the power Rome re-quires even Protestants to remove their hats to the host or even in the presence of a passing cross; and at least a portion of the Catholic press of the United States defends the practice. But notwithstanding the fact that Roman Catholics cannot consistently object to en-forced attendance upon religious services, every candid person most admit that it is wrong. " Reasoning is not necessary to es-tablish this truth," says Richard M. Johnson, " we are conscious of it in our own bosoms." Nevertheless some may argue that to force Roman Catholic convicts to attend Protestant services does not invade their religions liberty, since they are not forbidden to attend the services held by their own priests. The fact remains, however, ithat they are required to participate in a service which is repugnant to their sense of right. This is, however, just the way some people reason about compelling Sabbatarians to keep Sunday also: they say it is no interference with their rights of conscience, inasmuch as they are not forbidden to observe the seventh day also. But the plea is disingenuous in either case. Can the Catholic Review see it, however, in the case of the Sabbatarian who is required to keep Sunday also as clearly as it sees it in the case of those Catholic convicts who are compelled to attend religious services conducted by a Methodist preacher ? AMERICAN SENTINEL. Set for the defense of liberty of conscience, and is therefore uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward a union of Church and State, either in name or in fact.
