SUNDAY, the so-called Christian sab-bath, was brought to our shores about two hundred years befo-re Congress was regularly established. Its observ-ance was fostered by an intensely religious people. Their customs were un-mistakably molded by it, and the laws of the different common-wealths, which were formed as the country was settled, were strongly characterized by legislation in its behalf. Our Fundamental Laws Repudiate Sunday Legislation The time came when the various colonies wished to unite. After a metamorphosis covering some years they emerged with a full-fledged written Constitution and a federal government. Being mostly reli-gious men, it would not have been a strange thing if those who were instrumental in framing the funda-mental laws for these United States, had incorporated some of their reli-gious customs into that new Consti-tution. Many times these states-men expressed their belief in a guid-ing and overruling Providence.

No demand or suggestion is made in them for a law setting apart Sunday as a sabbath, nor even as a civil rest day. Nor is there any provision for such a thing in the future. The American Government Civil, Not Religious It is not necessary to recognize God and force his precepts upon unwilling minds by means of civil law ; for his law is already elevated to a higher position than any civil law ; it is in-trenched in the very citadel and throne of the heart, and far beyond the reach of any human law. Ewing THE SENATE AND 3 The taking of this position does not in any way disparage the value of consti-tutions framed by men; for, as one religious writer says : " It has been very aptly remarked, that the state which does not encroach on the sphere of the conscience of its subjects can be called antireligious just as correctly as it can be called anti-industrial, antimusical, and anti-medicinal, if it manufactures no tobacco, com-poses no opera, and dispenses no medicine."
