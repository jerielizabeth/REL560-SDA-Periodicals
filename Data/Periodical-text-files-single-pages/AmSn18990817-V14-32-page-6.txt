 502 AMERICAN SENTINEL.        tains the right of freedom of conscience for its citizens by this ample provision: "ART. I, SEc. 4. That no religion shall be established by law; that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect, society, denomination, or mode of wor-ship; that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship, nor to pay any tithe, taxes, or other rate, for building or repairing any place of wor-ship, or for maintaining any minister or ministry; that no 'religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust underthis State; and that the civil rights, privileges, and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner,  affected by his religions princi-ples." A broader and more emphatic assurance of religious freedom could scarcely have been given. The constitution of Tennessee declares:Š "ART. I, SEC. 3. That all men havd a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can, of right, be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of con-science; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." "SEc. 4. That no political or religious test, other than an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and of this State, shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this State." "ART. XI, SEC. 15. No person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest." The constitution of Maryland, in its Declaration of Rights, declares:Š "ART. 36. That as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most accept-able to Him, all persons are equally entitled to protec-tion in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought, by any law, to be molested in his person or estate nn account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practise, unless, under the color of relig-ion, he shall disturb the good order, peace, or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or in-jure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent .or main-tain, or contribute, unless on contract, to maintain any place of worship, or any ministry." If we should quote from the constitutions of other States in the South upon this p-Oint, it would only be to repeat in substance these guaranties of religious free-dom. From all this it 'is plain that in these States every person has a constitutional right to believe and practise any religion he may choose, within the limits apublic peace and safety. It was the express design of the -framers of the fundamental law to place all religions upon an equality before the law, and to shut out the possibility of legal sanction for any one above another. They expressly sought to guard against any use of the law as a weapon in religious controversy, or as a means of inflicting punishment by one religious party upon an-other. Yet just this thing has been done in these States. The law has been invoked by one side in a religious con-troversy against the other, and made the instrument of persecution against dissenters from the popular religion. It has been used by one religious party as a means of coercing another religious party into conformity with a dogma held by the religious majority. How could this be? How could the plain intent of the fathers of the State governments be set aside, the express statements of the fundamental law disregarded? This could not have been, but for a principle that had its rise not in an effort to safeguard religious freedom, but in a plain purpose to unite church and state. For centuries the idea had prevailed that the civil power ought to take cognizance of and punish "offenses against God and religion;" and so firmly fixed had this principle become in the institutions of society, that when the State governments were formed the people retained it upon the statute books, without pausing to consider how completely at variance it was with their constitutional guaranties of religious freedom. Among such "offenses" the most prominent was the non-observance of "the Lord's day." To fail to observe the "Lord's day," or the "first day of the week," in the manner prescribed by the legislature, is made a crime in every State of the Union, North and South alike, with but two exceptions! Upon this point the statutes of Georgia decree:Š "SEc. 4579. Violating Sabbath. Any tradesman, artificer, workman, or laborer, or other person what-ever, who shall pursue their business or work of their or-dinary callings on the Lord's day (works of necessity or charity only excepted) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished as prescribed in Sec-tion 4310 of this code." The penalties mentioned in this section are, a fine of not more than a thousand dollars, imprisonment not more than six months, and work in the chain-gang not longer than one year; any one or all of which may be imposed by the judge pronouncing sentence! The statutes of Mississippi declare with respect to Sunday:Š "SEc. 2949. Violation of the Sabbath. If any per-son, on a Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, shall himself be found laboring at his own or any other trade, calling, or business, or shall employ his apprentice, or servant, in labor or other business, except it be in the ordinary household offices of daily necessity, or other work of necessity or charity, he shall, onŁ conviction, be fined not more than twenty dollars for every offense, deeming every apprentice or servant, so employed, as constituting a distinct offense; Provided, that nothing in this section shall apply to railroads, or steamboat navigation in this State. "SEc. 2950. No merchant, shopkeeper or other per-
