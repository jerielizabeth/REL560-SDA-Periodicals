Aggregate Results Are Great National Calamity Imagine the unutterable grief and con-sternation that would come to this na-tion if we should receive the awful tid-ings tomorrow morning that the entire American Army had been massacred dur-ing the night. The whole nation would mourn, and would float the Stars and Stripes at half-mast.
