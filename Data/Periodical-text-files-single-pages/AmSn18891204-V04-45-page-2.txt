354 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL and State, and this union means a tyrannical government and a corrupt priesthood. It has been so in all ages, and we are not so superior to our ancestors that we may thrust our hands into the fire and escape without being burned. Relig-ious instruction ought not to be ignored, but the home and the church are the places wherein both precept and example will be most effective; but if liberty of conscience is valued It all, -keep religion away from public schools."ŠJewish Times and Observer. Hon. William Jackson Armstrong on Religious Legislation. IN the course of a lecture on "Romanian and Civil Liberty," delivered in this city on the 21st ult., Hon. William Jackson Armstrong, of Wash-ington, D. C., the well-known lecturer and jour-nalist, spoke as follows concerning the efforts of certain so-called Protestants to secure the pas-sage of a national Sunday law :Š One of the official organs of these misguided associations has said : " Whenever the Roman Catholics of this country are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them." Not a doubt of it! Well ! the Roman Catholics of the United States in their just-closed convention at Balti-more, have accommodated some of these fanatical gentlemen. They have accepted the proffered hands of the Sunday-Rest faction to establish by law a national Sabbath. The coalition has been made. Nature makes no indication of a Sabbath. ŁThe sun continues to shine, the birds to sing, the flowers to bloom, and the rivers to run, every day in the year. But after fifteen centuries of debate, these pious people, who represent only a fragment of the religious and Christian world, have decided which of the several days in dispute the Almighty has definitely appointed for rest and religious exercise by man; and they have resolved,with characteristic intolerance, to enforce this decision by law on their fellow-men. That was precisely the policy of the Roman Inquisi-tion for three hundred years. Their legislative mouth-piece at Washington has been equal to the occasion. He has formu-lated and introduced in the United States Senate an elaborate bill, by which all recreations on the first day of the week other than that of religious exercises, shall be, so far as the national govern-ment is concerned, prohibited to Americans by law. That bill lies before me. An examination of its provisions in detail would be an evening's entertainment. I hesitate to speak with disre-spect of a scheme near to the hearts of so many good folksŠas Douglas Jerrold hesitated before speaking disrespectfully of the equator. But I am under the disability suggested by the Rever-end Sydney Smith, who said that he made it a rule never to read any book he was called upon to review, for fear of taking a prejudice against it. I have read this bill. I have taken a prej-udice against it. I am constrained to say that, in my judgment, if you will take this bill and perforate with a street-car conductor's bell-punch all its misleading rhetoric and palpable sophis-tries, it will be found to resemble a remnant of Irish lace, or the countenance of a colored gen-tleman emerging from the varioloid. There  is a legend of Siam that they once had in that country an exceedingly Small and preten-tious king. That very small king was afflicted with a very,  large cancer. After a counsel of the royal surgeons, they operated for the removal of that tumor. But when they had taken away the tumor, it was found that the throne was va-cant. A cancer had been king of Siam. That pretentious little king was all cancer. It would not do to operate for the excision of cancer, on the United States Senate bill for Sabbath rest. There are a thousand reasons why this bill should not become American law. The attorney pleaded to the court that there were thirteen rea-sons why his client was not present in courtŠand that the first of these reasons was that his client was dead. The first objection against this bill for Sabbath rest is that you cannot make men tired by law so that they can rest only in one way on Sunday. It is the assumption of this bill that two doctrinal sermons and four prayers will act as an invariable tonic on a tired man. They will not always do it. To enact this bill would be to re-enact the joy-less Puritan Sabbath, on which, it is said, a man could not kiss his wifeŠthough he had neglected that connubial obligation during the other six days of the week. The enforcement of such a measure would make more infidels in six months than the feeble preaching and vigorous intoler-ance of the advocates of Sabbatarian legislation have made in half a century; and that is a strong statement. The sacredness of the voluntary Sab-bath would be lost by its becoming involuntary. One of the pretexts of this legislation is that it is to enforce merely a civil day of rest in favor of that fraction of American workingmen now employed in the government 'mail service, on railway lines, and in other occupations. But the serpent trail of religious legislation is over it all. Its purposes for religious ends are distinctly and unblushingly avowed by the high priests of American Protestant intolerance, who are its in-spiration. These benevolent gentlemen would enact, forsooth, a day of Sabbath rest for work-ingmen, and cut off by the same stroke the recrea-tions and innocent enjoyments in which four-fifths of American laborers are accustomed to seek, on that day, relief from six days of toil and confine-ment. That is Christian altruism with a ven-geance! I have no respect for the one-sided statement of any question. I have no respect for the plat-form of the autocrat. I have no respect for the opinion of the man Who fears to face its free dis-cussion. At any future or appointed time during my stay on this coast, I will cheerfully divide this platform with any representative of this claim for enforced rest by law, who desires to demonstrate its alleged merits before intelligent Americans. But I admonish that champion in advance, that if he seeks to vindicate his, cause under the principles of American liberty, rather_ than by the right of religious majorities to impose their observances on their fellow-men, its merits will be found Co be conspicuous by their absence. Such legislation as this has its origin in a total misconception of the problem to be solved. Some of its objects may be desirable. But they are not desirable through invoking the sword of the law to enforce them. They are desirable by quite other instrumentalities. What American workingmen need is not more rest on one day in the week, but more rest every day in the week, and greater facilities thereby for self-respect and improvement, which cannot come by Sabbath  laws, but by the elevation of the sense of Ameri-can justice. If the Sabbath of a majority of any religious faith can be appointed by law through the power of majorities, then that Sabbath can be abol-ished by law. It can be proscribed in turn in favor of the Sabbath of any other religious ma-jority. The Jew and the Seventh-day Baptist may by force of attainable numbers enact their Sabbath in its stead. The infidel by the right of an emergent majority may extirpate the Sabbath of the Christian, and silence by law the sound of church bells that disturb his secular ear. And if in this nation the zeal of religious convictions could again successfully invoke the arm of the secular State for intolerance, better that that dream of the atheist were realized, and that churches and alleged religion were banished from this land. Religion that persecutes is not religion. It is the doctrine of an imperial state of this Union, solemnly uttered by its highest civil tribunal, that " true Christianity does not' shield itself behind majorities; that a form of religion that cannot live under equal laws, ought to die." The day on which discrimination for religious opinion is inaugurated in the administration of this government, will be the day of the death of the republicŠthe failure of the American experimentŠthe funeral of civil liberty. The American Protestant who clamors for the aid of the State to impose upon his fellow-citizens the least of his religious observances, has not a leg to stand on while demanding of Rome the abatement of her claim for State support of paro-chial schools. Let him first remove the beam from his own eye. The logic of civil liberty is inexorable. It does not end at the doors of the Catholic Church. The reprobation of the un-constitutional and un-American demands of that church, from the standpoint of sectarian hostility, is an attempted debauchment of the public con-science. There is no force in such warfare. The arm that strikes is unhinged at the shoulder. This is the land of religious liberty. The con-tests of creeds should be the contests of Christian charity. Protestantism should know better. It assumes to have been the peculiar defender and champion of religious liberty since Luther. It has no ex-cuse. It has nowhere any temporal head to serve. Rome, at least, is consistent. Her policy for thirteen centuries has been the sameŠthe aggrandizement of her earthly power. What could it avail the supreme Deity of the universe that his power shall be recognized by the civil governments of this world? That kingdom is spiritual,Šit exists in the hearts of men, or it does not exist at all. Jesus of Nazareth was the respecter of civil liberty. But do any of these people, Romish or Protest-ant, know what they do? Do they know the essence of their demand ? Do they not see the destroying demon of intolerance they invoke for their own children? They would break the col-umns of the great Constitution and let fall the fragments of its temple upon their own heads. They forget the ages of blood from which this fabric of freedom has been slowly reared. They forget that the liberty for the most intolerant atheist is the liberty for, the humblest Christian in this landŠone and the same. They forget that man cannot be made religious by law. They demand a civil government with the affirma-tion of creed. They would make discrimination for opinion. They would roll back the centuries and persecute for faith. Intolerance is a two-
