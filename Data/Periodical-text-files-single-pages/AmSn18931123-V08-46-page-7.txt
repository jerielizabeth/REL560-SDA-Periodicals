His work in France is great, but his work in the United States is even greater. This is the larger field. Here the people have been born to the estate of freedom, and to that of self-government and Leo wants Catholic-ism to go hand in hand with popular suffrage. Such things are significant, and espe-cially when taken in connection with the trend of public sentiment in the United States Romeward. The coming of Satolli, the Catholic, Congress, and the World's Parliament of Religions have directed all eyes toward Rome as never before in the history of the country, and the increase 'Of popish influence is simply astounding. Nor is this remarkable turning toward Rome confined to the United States; all the world is wondering after the beast. THE November Arena closes the eighth volume of this popular review, which, by the conspicuous ability of its contributors, has become a power in our land. The November issue contains, among other brilliant papers, a noteworthy article written by the late Richard A. Proctor, in which the eminent astronomer reviews the claims of Bacon and Shakespeare at length. This paper was originally a por-tion of a correspondence between Mr. Proctor and his daughter. The Bacon-Shakespeare case closes in this issue. Rabbi Solomon Schindler contributes a very thoughtful, though rather Socialistic paper, entitled, " Thoughts in an Orphan Asylum." E. P. Powell's contribution is a strikingly interesting "Study of Thomas Paine." Louis Frechette, the poet-laureate of Canada, appears in an interesting his-toric story entitled, " La Corriveau." The book reviews are also a noteworthy feature of this number. Those who would keep in touch with live issues should include this review in their list for the ensuing year. The announcements for 1894 are very interesting. SOME VALUABLE BOOKS FOR YOUNG MEN. We have secured the following books which we can recommend, not only as unobjectionable but as highly beneficial reading for young men:Š Moral Muscle and How to Use It, by FRED-ERICK ATKINS. A Brotherly Chat with Young Men. " This is positively the best book for young men that we have seen. It looks the facts of young men's lives full in the face, and proclaims the gospel of industry, perseverance, self-con-trol, and manly Christianity. We can certify that no one will find it stupid."ŠSt. Andrews Cross. First Battles and How to Fight Them, by F. A. ATKINS. Friendly Chats with Young Men. "It is true in substance, attractive in its style, and admira-ble in its spirit. I heartily commend this little volume."ŠRev. John Hall, D.D. The Spiritual Athlete and now He Trains, by W. A. BODELL. Introduction by REV. B. FAY MILLS. A. work for young men, pithy, pointed and practical. " Its power and value lie in the consistent carrying out of the comparison between physical and spiritual training."ŠThe Independent. Brave and True, by J. THAIN DAVIDSON. Talks to Young Men. " This is one of the books the wide distribution of which cannot be too greatly desired."ŠPresbyterian Journal.
