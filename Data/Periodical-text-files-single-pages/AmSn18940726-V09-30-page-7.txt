IS THE PAPACY IN PROPHECY? BY THE Rev. Thomas W. Haskins, M. A., Rector Christ Church, Los Angeles, Cal. The above is the title of a treatise written by the author, at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a discussion upon the present aspect and aims of The Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as the Papacy, or Vaticanism, Is Outlined in the Prophecies of Holy Scriptures, with sufficient accuracy to determine what the " Papacy " is, and what is to be its future develop-ment and ultimate end. Paper Covers, - - - 25 Cents. Cloth Covers, - - - - 60 Cents. Mailed, post-paid, on receipt of price. The Law of God as Changed by the Papacy Is the title of a large Chart just issued, which shows in a striking manner the blasphemous pre-tentious of the Papal power. The testimony of the Best Catholic Authorities is given, and shows, by quoting their own words, that Sunday is a child of the Catholic Church. These quotations, together with admissions from standard Catholic works, are arranged in parallel columns on either side of this Chart, while the center column contains the Ten Commandments as taught by the Catholic Church. The whole forms a collection of extracts of incalcu-lable value for every Bible student. The Charts are three by four feet in size, and are printed on heavy map cloth in bold type, easily read across the largest room. Price, Post-paid, $1.00. A fac-simile edition on thin paper, size 54 x 74 inches, suitable for missionary distribution, has been prepared, and will be sent post-paid at 50 cents per hundred, or $4.00 per thousand.

What relation do they sustain to each other ? The title of this interesting and valuable book ought to be sufficient to recommend it to the earnest searcher after truth. The conception that there is an intimate relation between the gospel and the work of creation, makes this able little production at once of peculiar interest and profit, especially to those who have been accustomed to consider that the gospel did not exist in the old dispensation, but that it is con-fined in both application and promulgation to the new dispensation. The spirit of the Old Testament is the Spirit of Christ, as witnessed by the ancient prophets. Christ was the Creator; and since the works of creation were the works of Christ, the story of creation contains the gospel, which, like creation, reveals the power of God. Hence, when Moses wrote of the works of creation-the works of Christ-he wrote the gospel. The heavens and the earth and all contained therein -the works of creation-teach the power of God-the gospel-in a language that can be understood by all people, of whatever tongue. Since Christ the Creator is Christ the Redeemer, creative power is re-demptive power; and in considering the power man-ifested in creation, we are contemplating the power of redemption. These truths are all set forth in clear and concise language, and the author's deductions are logical, and substantiated in every case by the plain words of Scripture. And since there is no knowledge, science, or truth which the Bible does not unfold, no one can afford to be without this book, of which " the only design is to lead the reader to study the Word more closely for himself."
