The Supremacy of the Papacy By Alonzo T. Jones IX THE PAPACY-THE VERY SAME PAPACY THAT THE WORLD KNEW IN THE TENTH CENTURY-IS TO-DAY AIMING TO SECURE TO HERSELF A RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SHE HAD THIS ONCE. THE ARTICLES THAT ARE APPEARING UNDER THE ABOVE HEADING ARE A STUDY OF HOW SHE USED IT. SINCE IT IS HER OWN BOAST THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES," TO KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH SUCH SUPREMACY WHEN SHE HAD IT IS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH IT WHEN SHE SECURES IT AGAIN. Pope John XXIII p OPE JOHN XXIII. is the last of the Johns of the Papacy, and also the worst. " John XXIII. is another of those popes, the record of whose life, by its contradictions, moral anomalies, al-most impossibilities, perplexes and baffles the just and candid historian. That such, even in those times, should be the life even of an Italian churchman, and that after such a life he should ascend to the papacy, shocks belief. Yet the record of that life rests not merely on the concur-rent testimony of all the historians of the time, two of them secretaries to the Roman court, but is avouched by the deliberate sanction of the Council of Con-stance."Å Milman. While only a plain cleric, Balthasar Cossa had been a pirate ; and his piratical disposition as well as " the pirate's habit of sleeping by day and waking by night," remained with him after he had ceased the actual prac-tise of a professional pirate and had become successively archdeacon, pope's chamberlain, pope's cardinal-legate, and Pope. It was Pope Boniface IX. who had appointed Balthasar Cossa his legate " to wrest the city of Bologna from the domi-nation of the Visconti. The legate ful-filled his mission ; the poor student of law, the archdeacon of Bologna, became the lord of that city with as absolute and unlimited dominion as the tyrant of any other of the Lombard or Romagnese  commonwealths. Balthasar Cossa, if hardly surpassed in extortion and cruelty by the famous Ecceline, by his debauch-eries might have put to shame the most shameless of the Viscontis. Under his iron rule day after day such multitudes of persons of both sexes, strangers as well as Bolognese, were put to death on charges of treason, sedition, or other crimes, that the population of Bologna seemed dwindling down to that of a small city. He used to order the execution-ers to dispatch their victims with greater celerity. " Neither person nor possession was exempt from his remorseless taxation. Grain could not be ground, nor bread made, nor wine sold without his license. From all ranks, from the noble to the peasant, he exacted the most laborious services. He laid taxes on prostitutes, gaming-houses, usurers. His licentious-ness was even more wide and promis-cuous. Two hundred maids, wives, and widows, with many nuns, are set down as victims of his lust. Many were put to death by their jealous and indignant husbands and kindred. The historian wonders that in so rich and populous a city no husband's, or father's, or broth-er's dagger found its way to the heart of the tyrant. " So is Balthasar Cossa described by Theodoric a Niem, his secretary. Leo-nardo Aretino, another secretary,
