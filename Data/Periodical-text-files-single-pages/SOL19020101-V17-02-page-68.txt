134  THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY "A Glimpse of the Life Boat Mission" is an interesting article by E. B. VanDorn, super-intendent of the Life Boat Mission; "What Can be Done with the Fragments of Hu-manity," is the title of a strong article by H. L. Henderson, chaplain of the Indiana State Prison, which shows what can be done for a prisoner behind the bars. Eld. Luther Warren, under the title of "Some Experi-ences Not Easily Forgotten," relates a thrill-ing experience which occurred while he was connected with the Chicago Medical Mis-sion. "An Impressive Anniversary Service" contains the personal experience of a young.  woman who was not only marvelously saved, but who has been transformed into an earnest missionary worker. No one can read this article without having his faith in God strengthened. Another article relates how a single copy of the Life Boat Ted eventually to the deliverance of a drug fiend from the horrible bondage of drug slavery. The Life Boat should be a regular visitor in every home. It will furnish fuel to keep bright the missionary fire in the hearts of your children. Will you not subscribe at once?

At intervals during the past few years the editor of The Ladies' Home Journal has at-tacked the "cramming" and "pushing" sys-tems so prevalent among the schools of this country. Each editorial given to this subject has brought hundreds of letters, most of them not only acknowledging the wrong, but adding, as well, strong and sad proofs to the statements made. These letters were kept. In the January issue of The Journal the edi-tor's page is occupied by brief excerpts from sixty-eight of them. They are "dedicated to the American parent," and classed under three heads: "A Roll for Educators to Ponder Over," "A Roll for Parents to Think Over," and "A Roll Which Speaks for Itself." There are no names, dates or locali-ties mentioned. Nothing but the unsought testimony of .a few out of the thousands who are suffering the silence of this "sorrowful tribute to modern schooling." Here is one of the sixty-eight: "Our poor little boy, just previous to his passing away, went into a delirium of fear that he would not get his 'marks.' His dread was something pitiable." 416********1tstS#4.#*-#164P-44.--16-iti..****.**11.16116  A Little Dictionary You will not require a reading rack to hold this library, for all this in-formation and more, is in a little book that will fit into the vest pocket.
