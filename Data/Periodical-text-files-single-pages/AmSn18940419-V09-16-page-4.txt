124 AMlaILLICAN VoL. 6. Ro. 1. the passage of an amendment such as would recognize their form of Christianity as the constitutional one. There is no way in which this question of religion in the constitutions, State or national, can be safely treated except on the basis of exclusion. The attitude of the Federal Constitution is purely negative in that regard: " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of reli-gion." That is all. Religion has nothing to do with the Constitution or with Con-gress, and Congress or the Constitution should have nothing to do with religion. That is the principle, and the only princi-ple, on which the American people should treat any proposal to unite religious and secular affairs in the conduct of govern-ment.ŠSt. Paul Dispatch. Why Adventists Work on Sunday. [The SENTINEL has been asked to define its position as to the requirement of the fourth commandment in its relation to Sunday labor. This cannot be done better than by reprinting No. 55 of the Sentinel Li-brary, which was first published as an article in this paper on May, 18, 1893. The paragraphs quoted from the Review and Herald can be found in its issue of June 14, 1892, page 377.] THE Sunday cases in Maryland have again revived the question of how Advent-ists regard the fourth commandment of the Decalogue; not that it is a proper legal question, for it is not, but because in Maryland, as in Tennessee, courts of justice have so far forgotten their proper functions as to assume to declare that the religious faith of the Adventists does not require them to work on Sunday. The fact is that the Adventists do re-gard it as a sacred duty to habitually devote Sunday to secular purposes; and this because they understand that the fourth commandment establishes a differ-ence between the Sabbath and the six other days of the week, and requires men to respect that difference. To ignore this distinction between the Sabbath and the other days of the week, is simply to defeat the object of the divine law, and to set up a counterfeit of the memorial which God has ordained to keep in remembrance the fact that he is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The view of the Adventists is that physical rest for man is not the primary object of the Sabbath; for it "was made for man " before the fall, as our Lord himself declares, and consequently before man stood in need of rest from wearing toil. Clearly its object was to keep in lively exercise man's loyalty to God as the Creator, just as our peculiarly national holidaysŠthe Fourth of July and Wash-ington's BirthdayŠare designed to fan the flame of patriotism in the American breast. Viewed from this standpoint, it is plain that the fourth commandment, not only enjoins the `keeping of the true Sabbath, but it likewise forbids rivals and counterfeits. Every law must show in some way tho authority by which it was enacted, and this the Decalogue does only in the fourth commandment. In that precept it is de-clared that the Giver of the law is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh. It is this fact that gives the Sabbath its memorial character. The Sabbath commandment is in fact the seal of the divine law, be-cause it is the precept that designates the Giver of the law, and states the ground of his authority to require obedience. In like manner the Sunday institution  is the seal or mark of a rival power. It is set forth by the papacy, the " man of sin " of 2 Thess. 2 : 3Šas the badge of his authority to command men under sin. In a Catholic catechism, called the " Abridg-ment of Christian Doctrine," the Catholic Church asserts its power to change the divine law, in the following manner :Š Ques. How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days ? Ans. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church. Q. How prove you that ? A. Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power. Another Catholic work called, "Doc-trinal Catechism," offers the following as proof that Protestants are not guided by the Scriptures :Š Ques. Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept ? Ans. Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her;Šshe could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observ-ance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority. Q. When Protestants do profane work upon Satur-day, or the seventh day of the week, do they follow the Scripture as their only rule of faithŠdo they find this permission clearly laid down in the sacred vol-ume? A. On the contrary, they have only the authority of tradition for this practice. In profaning Saturday they violate one of God's commandments, which he has never clearly abrogated.Š" Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day." Believing the papacy to be antichrist, and holding the Sunday Sabbath to be the badge of its power, it is evident that with Adventists the observance of Sun-day would be equivalent to rendering homage to antichrist; hence their steady refusal to obey Sunday laws, and their willingness to suffer imprisonment, the chain-gang, or even death itself rather than to so much as appear to regard Sun-day as other than a common working-day. It is not as many seem to regard it, simply a matter of the choice of days, but is with the Adventists a vital question directly affecting their salvation. Some months since the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, the denominational organ of the Adventists, had an editorial article upon this subject which we re-printed at the time, but from which we now make the following extracts :Š Every person has a right to work six days in every week, for the language of the commandment is, "Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work." These words . . . confer upon mankind a God-given right, . . . beside which all opposing human au-thority becomes an absolute nullity. But the language of the commandment imparts something more than a mere permission to labor upon six days of the week. It imparts something in the nature of an obligation. . . . Six days of the week are left to be devoted to man and his temporal inter-ests, but the seventh day is the Lord'sŠthe day upon which he rested, and which he blessed and sanctified. This day must therefore be kept distinct and separate from all other days, and of course the means for doing this must not be likewise employed in behalf of other days, or the distinction would be lost. . . . The observance of the commandment by rest upon the sev-enth day would be nullified by the like rest upon the other day. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the six working days should be kept distinct in char-acter from that day which God has set apart for himself. But the impropriety of resting upon both the sev-enth and first days of the week does not stop here; for the first day is a rival Sabbath, Peculiarly of-fensive to God, therefore, must any act be which is an acknowledgment of the claims of this false Sabbath to the sanctity and reverence due his own day. In what other way could such observance of the first day, by one who knew its claims to be false, be taken, but as an insult to the Creator ? In what other way could the Creator himself regard it ? The person who refrains from labor upon the first day of the week, thereby acknowledges either the claims of the day, or the authority of the power which seeks to enforce such rest. He may not " keep " the day as the Sabbath day should be kept. according to the spirit of the Sabbath commandmentŠhis observ-ance of it may be one of form only ; but this in the eyes of others at least, is an observance of the day, for only each individual can examine the thoughts and intents of his own heart. The eyes of the world around us can not, or at least do not, penetrate beyond the letter of our Sabbath observanceŠthe outward refraining from labor; this is all, therefore, that can be asked of any one in enforcing Sunday observance. This also is all that the authors of the first day Sab-bath ever asked as that which should constitute its observance. Sunday was never blessed, sanctified, and made holy; as a rival to the true Sabbath, it is sufficient that the religious world should be induced to rest and attend religious worship upon that day instead of on the seventh day. The edicts which gave rise to Sunday observance never commanded anything more; nor is anything more exacted by the apostate church which has ever been the especial guardian of the day. Every intelligent person knows that the Roman Catholic Church does not demand of its mem-bers the observance of Sunday in the spirit of Isa. 58: 13. . . . The Catholic Church does not demand Sunday ob-servance as an act of worship to God, but as an act of homage to itself, and as such it is an act in the highest degree offensive to God. It lowers his Sabbath before the world to a level with the spurious, rival Sabbath which is of satanic origin. It nullifies entirely the act of resting upon the preceding seventh day. To worship God, and an antichristian power also, is to worship the latter power alone. God demands that we should worship and serve him always, and him only. The devil is satisfied to let us serve God part of the time and himself the rest of the time, well knowing that we are thereby serving him all the time, and God not at all. We do not think also that any person can afford to surrender, under such circum-stances, his right, before mentioned, to six days of secular employment in every week. He who surren-ders a God-given right in obedience to an arbitrary demand by any earthly power, merely as an act of homage to itself, makes himself a slave. We think therefore that it should be a matter of conscience with all observers of the true Sabbath, not to comply with the demand to rest on the first day of the week. This is put very mildly, but it is none the less positive; it expresses the view of the denomination upon the subject, and should settle at once and forever the ques-tion of how Adventists regard the claims of the fourth commandment. Of course it is not a matter of which the courts can properly take cognizance, for to do so would be to become judges of the con-sciences of that people; but the fact does show most conclusively that Sunday laws do at least interfere with the religious rights of the Adventists, by requiring of them a service which they can not con-scientiously render. This is in addition to the hardship of being deprived of one-sixth of the time divinely allotted to them for work. C. P. B. Defection of the "Mail and Express." THE Mail and Express, of Monday, April 9, in the course of an editorial arti-cle on the subject of prohibition, expresses itself thus upon the question of attempted enforcement of morality:Š We repeat our proposition that coercion is a failure in regulating human conduct. You cannot prevent vice or produce virtue by force. Indeed, there is no virtue in a forced act. People cannot be legislated into morality. Virtue is voluntary and must come from within. Laws are for the regulation of external acts, and while they may to some extent restrain human conduct, they must forever fail in forming and con-trolling human character. Ł . . Out of the heart proceeds the issues of life. As a man "thinketh in his heart so is he." Moral precepts are addressed to the heart, the seat of the moral nature of man. Character is determined by the kind of prin-ciples' adopted for the regulation of conduct. Char-acter is the pivot upon which conduct turns. Law properly framed may measurably regulate conduct, but it can never reform, much less transform, char-acter. True reformation must come from within, through the influence of Christian motives. Divine law controls the heart-issues by changing the heart.
