FRANCIS SCOTT KEY MONUMENT, BALTIMORE, MD. LIBERTY 179 rights of conscience, enacted, also, the statutes of 1705, 1786, and 1794, for the suppression of worldly employments on Sunday. So far from conflicting with those invaluable rights of conscience, they regarded such statutes as indispensable to se-cure them. It would be a small boon to the peo-ple of Pennsylvania to declare their indefeasible right to worship God ac-cording to the dictates of their consciences, amid the din and confusion of secular employments, and with desecrations on every hand of what they conscientiously believe to be hallowed time.
