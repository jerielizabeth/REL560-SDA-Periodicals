The Supremacy of the Papacy By Alonzo T. Jones X THE PAPACYŠTHE VERY SAME PAPACY THAT THE WORLD KNEW IN THE TENTH CENTURYŠIS TO-DAY AIMING TO SECURE TO HERSELF A RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SHE HAD THIS ONCE. THE ARTICLES THAT ARE APPEARING UNDER THE ABOVE HEADING ARE A STUDY OP HOW SHE USED IT. SINCE IT IS HER OWN BOAST THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES," TO KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH SUCH SUPREMACY WHEN SHE HAD IT IS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH IT WHEN SHE SECURES IT AGAIN. John XXIII and the Council of Constance THE Council of Constance met Nov. I, 1414, and continued till April 22, -1418. The total number of the clergy alone present at the council, though per-haps not all of them all the time, was four patriarchs, twenty-nine cardinals, thirty-three archbishops, one hundred and fifty bishops, one hundred and thirty-four abbots, two hundred and fifty doctors, and lesser clergy, amounting to eighteen thousand. With the emperor and his train, kings, dukes, lords, and other nobles, the numbers were ordinarily fifty thousand. At certain periods of the con-ference there were as many as one hun-dred thousand present. Thirty thousand horses were fed, and thirty thousand beds were provided by the city. The council was opened with John XXIII. presiding. Deputies were pres-ent from both Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII. Gregory's deputies promptly de-clared, in behalf of their master, that he was ready to resign, upon condition that both the other popes should resign at the same time. They also presented to the em-peror a petition asking that John XXIII. should not be allowed to preside at the council. To consider this subject there was appointed, apart from the council, a general assembly of the heads of the na-tions who were present. They reported a recommendation that the three popes should voluntarily resign. Pope John instantly agreed, and himself drew up a form of resignation. But, as the assem-bly was not satisfied with it, he left it with them to frame. To this assembly of the nations there was presented a memorial containing a long list of the crimes of the life of John XXIII., stating that these crimes could be proved by unexceptionable witnesses, if the council chose to hear them. As the crimes were notorious already, and undeniable, even by John, he proposed to the assembly that he should plead guilty before the council, reminding them of the generally received maxim that " a pope could not be deposed for any crime except that of heresy." But this proposi-tion was refused by the assembly, on the ground that they could not think it decent that such heinous crimes should be laid publicly before the council, to be nar-rowly inquired into. They therefore ad-vised that the memorial be suppressed, provided John would consent to the resignation which they would frame. To this John agreed. The assembly there-fore drew up the form of the proposed resignation as follows : I, Pope John XXIII., for the peace of the-whole Christian world, declare, promise, vow, and swear to God, to His holy Church, and to this holy council, to give peace to the Church by the way of cession, or resignation of the pontificate, and to execute freely and spon-taneously what I now promise, in case Peter de Luna and Angelus Corarius, called in their obediences, Benedict XIII. and Gregory XIIŠ
