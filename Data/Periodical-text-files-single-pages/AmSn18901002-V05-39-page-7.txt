THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 311 THIS PAMPHLET CONTAINS THE ARGUMENTS IN BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BLAIR SUNDAY- REST BILL, WHICH MR. JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, DECEMBER 13, 1888. And Mr. Jones' comments' make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions; objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments.

The argument is based on Scripture and history, constitution' and .law, showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-Law Movement of the Fourth Century, AND THE Sunday-Law Movement of the Nineteenth Century. The Methods Used in Securing Indorsements to the Petition for the Blair Bill, and the Workings of Such Sunday Laws as are Proposed for the United States.

"MIGHTY INTERESTING READING." Scriptural, Logical, Plain, and Forcible. THIS IMPORTANT WORK SHOWS CLEARLY THE RELATION THAT SHOULD EXIST BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE AT THE PRESENT TIME, AS PROVEN BY THE BIBLE AND HISTORY OF THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE CENTURIES.  CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION IN ENGLISH AND GERMAN CHAP. I outlines vividly the relation that existed between " Christianity and the Roman Empire." CHAP. II distinguishes between " What is due to God and what to Ctesar." CHAP. III shows for what purpose the " Powers that Be " are ordained. CHAP. IV ably discusses " The Religious Attack upon the United States Constitution, and Those Who Are Making it:" CHAP. V unmasks " Religious Legislation," calling special attention to the Blair Sunday Bill now pending in Congress. CHAP. VI  is devoted to the "Sunday-Law Movement in the Fourth Century, and its Parallel in the Nineteenth." Chap. VII shows The Workings of Sunday Laws when they are enforced. These chapters, with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States which are printed in Appendices C and D, make this treatise INDISPENSABLE TO EVERY LOVER OF CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

Address, PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHINC CO., 48 BOND STREET, NEw-  YORK, of fashions, graceful concessions to a silken Christianity, they say, with haughty humility which fits so well their perfect manner and easy courtliness of bearing, " We are the King's Daughters,' we command you 'In His Name.'" But who are these who pass as a brook of rippling youthful laughter fit to flow through the golden streets ? It is the Young People's Society of Christian En-deavor, the children's crusade of the nineteenth century, march-ing to as pitiful an end, and for as futile a purpose, as were the Crusaders when led by fanatic zeal to the' conquest of the holy sephlchre. As a rear-guard to this mar-vellous religious army of the world, marches a vast body of churchmen at arms, whose very presence is a benediction, and whose benign graciousness as-sures to the motley host protec-tion and.  safety for time and eternity,Šthe Evangelical and Ministerial Alliance. As outposts, and flying patrol along the whole line, the Law and Order Leagues are stationed. This is " the National Reform soldiery marching as for war.' "- Does this display of worldly influence and human force tally well with that meek and saintly patience which the Bible says must characterize those who be-come subjects of our Lord and of his Christ, in his eternal king- dom ? W. H. M. IT is remarkable that in this country of boasted religious lib-erty, Christians use the civil courts to persecute other Chris-tians who insist upon obeying the Bible by working six days in the week and resting on the seventh.
