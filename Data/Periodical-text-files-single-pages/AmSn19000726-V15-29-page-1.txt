F. 330141_,M.A.1-1,1 , Civil government does not derive its authority from any people's opinions respecting the will of God, however conscientiously held. The Chinese are very patriotic; but the true patri-otism is that which is not narrowed down to the in-terests of self, or of country, but seeks the highest ,welfare of mankind. The "Christian" nations cry for vengeance upon China ; but Christianity seeks no vengeance save to heap "coals of fire" on the heads of evil men by acts of kindness ; it lifts no sword save the "sword of the Spirit." <A <A To prove that Sunday laws are right, it is usually necessary for clergymen to pose as statesmen and physicians, prescribing for the welfare of the state and the health of the human body.
