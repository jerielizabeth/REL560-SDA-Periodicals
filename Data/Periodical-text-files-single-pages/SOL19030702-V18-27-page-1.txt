The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII  NEW YORK, JULY 2, 1903  NO. 27   We are like the Israelites of old. They had the great prophet, and they had a great revelation, even the moral law that flamed from Sinai. But they were not content; they looked around, and saw other nations around them driveling and groveling before idols of stone and idols of gold, which their own hands had made, and they said: "Why can't we be like the other nations? Why can't we, too, have. gods of stone and of gold like the nations which surround us?" And they forgot the God of Right-eousness, who had chosen them for His own. So we are saying: "Let us, too, have gods of commerce and gods of expansion, like the nations that surround us; let us, too, bow before these idols." And we forget the God of Righteousness, that has chosen us for His own. See page 428. Aristocratic, oligarchical tendencies already exist in our midst and are getting stronger and stronger. . . . Al-ready, under the forms of democracy, actual oligarchy has developed in this country. Many of our reformers are disposed to cure the ills of the state by tinkering at the machineryÑa change in the ballot law, that will help; a new form of primary law, that will help; or some other little external change.  Nothing of the kind will help; the evil is in the spirit of the people. There must come a spiritual change, an inner change, or 'km shall not be helped.  See page 425.
