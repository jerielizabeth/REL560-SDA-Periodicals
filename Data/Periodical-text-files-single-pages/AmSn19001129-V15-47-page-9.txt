PERSECUTION UNDER SUNDAY LAWS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, THE records of slavery in_ the island of Porto Rico, investigated by the United, States commission appointed to examine into and report upon the con-dition of that country and its people., yield testimony showing how it fared with people who differed from the majority, in the matter, of Sabbath observance under Spanish Catholic rule three centuries ago. The following report is made by Mr. Charles E. Buell, secretary to the head of the commission, Dr. H. K. Carroll: _ " Priorto the establishing of negro slavery, the slavery of the Indians, who were -declared to be rebels of Porto Rico, was decreed by Don Fernando the Catholic, pursuant to the Ley de Partidas, or law of the ancient, Spanish Code. It seems also that - white slavery existed to some extent in the island during the early days of colonization. From the most trustworthy accounts, there were white female slaves sent to Porto Rico from Spain and her depen-dencies, and the more important fact appears that these white female slaves were so sent on account of their religious faith; they were victims of a relig-ious persecution; these white female slaves were forced into slavery and deported, banished to a far-away island, as a punishment for a belief that was contrary to the belief of the then state church of Spain. The most probable cause of the punishment of these women was their-belief in, and obedience to, the commandment of the Decalogue regarding-Sabbath observance; they were keepers of the seventh day as the Sabbath, and for this they were sold into slavery, and were sent thousands of miles from their native homes to an island which was then Considered as a most undesirable place to be held in bondage. " According to the historian, Don Jose' J. Acosta, - there were sent from Spain to Porto Rico during the period from 15II to 1515, for sale, white female slaves, cristainos viljas (old Christians). This classi-fication implies that these Christian women were believers in a creed older than the then Catholic belief; namely, the belief of the primitive Christian sect,which differed mainly in the observance of the Sabbath day, instead of Sunday (Saba& instead of .Ponzingo). "This-data of the illustrious abolitionist,' says Senor Brau, ' is corroborated bV the license granted by the Catholic king to Hernando de peralta, in Burgos, July 2, '151, to take to San Juan two white Christian slaves; this confirmation isT strengthened by the fact that Don Fernando declined to hear the petition which the authorities of Porto Rico addressed to him asking that the introduction of these slaves to the island should be prohibited, because the inhabitants.preferred them in marriage to the other women, who were held in less esteem on account of their being cristainos nuevas (new Christians) or better said, tainted with Moorish and.  Jewish blood.'" Of the degradation of the people in genefat, caused by the forcing of slavery upon the island, Mr. Buell says: "The competition of slavery with the free labor of the island was sufficient to pauperize the free laborers-, and to-day the mass of peons that live scattered throughout the island bear testimony to the dire necessities which held the free laborers in a bondage that was worse than slavery." "The poverty of the people, growing out of the condition due to competition with slavery, has led -to a desire to live isolated, to seek seclusion. One gentleman, speaking of the scattered condition of the peons, says: ' If the planters could be prevailed upon to allow the peon class to live on the estates, and not emp'oy those who have to walk three or four miles to work, the owners would lose nothing, and the peons would become sociable and form villages, in which schools could be gradually estab-lished.' " The result of slavery in Porto Rico now raises one of the most difficult problems: how to educate and elevate the scattered peons."
