SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT 335 respondent of the Worcester Spy re-ported under date of April 28 that boys of that town " go every Sunday to a cer-tain lot at the foot of Worcester Street and there break the Sabbath by playing baseball." He says " complaints have been entered," and that if the playing is continued " the police may have some- thing to say about the matter."ŠAt a meeting of the ministerial association of Silver Lake, Minn., on April 20 a com-mittee was appointed to " investigate the law " regarding Sunday baseball and to see what could be done to stop " that form of Sabbath desecration." Could the Sunday laws' in the differ-ent States have a thorough overhauling in accordance with the enlightened public opinion of the age, the result would be a great boon to civilization. They are no-where fully enforced as they stand on the statute books, because they have been really outgrown by public sentiment. They are sadly behind the times. Yet it is remarkable what acts of injustice are  committed in these days on account of Sunday legislation. The religious perse-cution of the Seventh-day Adventists in the State of Tennessee a few years ago was sanctioned by judicial power, but it aroused the indignation of the just and liberty-loving people of the country. The laws, however, are still unchanged which permit of such a coercive, tyrannical inter-pretation.ŠThe Jewish Spectator, Mem-phis. '  rte:   /E rŁŁŁŁ4  4  Or.Ł A.,.

Jones' book entitled '4' k  A;  .4- "THE TWO REPUBLICS" r.  , Sft% if:  3 -.Ł; is a comparative study of the underlying principles of the two greatest RepublicsŠRome 0,  ' Ofr and the United States. 3  3 '4;   "The principle of Rome in all its phases is that religion and government are insepa- ft,o , rable. The principle of the government of the United States is that religion is essentially :4,  idistinct and wholly separate from civil government, and entirely exempt from its cog- 4' nizance. f "As it was Christianity that first and always antagonized this governmental principle 4 of Rome, and established the governmental principle of the United States of America, ':- 4 the fundamental idea, the one thread-thought of the whole book, is to develop the princi- 4 Pi  aples of Christianity with reference to civil government, and to portray the mischievous 0 3 tk. results of the least departure from those principles." e3 1 Rome occupies one extreme and the United States the other. Which is right? The Pt  4.
