Human invention has devised nothing, human power has compassed nothing, that can forcibly restrain it, when it breaks forth. . . . It loses its power only when it has gained its object. . . . Its efforts to throw off restraint would burst the world asunder. 41 Thanks be to God, that this spot was honored as the asylum of re-ligious liberty. May its standard, reared here, remain forever ! May it rise up high as heaven, tin its banner shall fan the air of both continents, and wave as a glorious ensign of peace and security to the nations 1 From a discourse delivered by Daniel Webster at Plymouth, Kass., Dec. 22, 1820, to the Plymouth Society.
