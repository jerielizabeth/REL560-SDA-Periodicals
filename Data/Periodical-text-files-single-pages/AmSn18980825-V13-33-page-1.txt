GOD'S WAY OF REACHING HEAVEN VS. MAN'S WAY. Gon's way is by the Ladder of Jacob's dream; man's way is by the Tower of Babel. The structure reared in the plains of Shinar was symbolical of heathenism in all ages, which seeks to gain heaven by works. Multi-tudes to-day are striving to mount upwards by a tower of babel. Some rest upon their respectability, as did the Pharisees. Others think to approach God through penance. Millions are calling for legislation to make righteousness easy and sin hard; and all over the world is sounded the call for federation, to unite the good people of the earth in religious and political leagues, which shall sweep away earth's wrongs and usher in the millennium. But there is only one true way of mounting to the throne of God, and that is by the divine Ladder upon which Jacob saw the angels ascending and descending,Šthat Ladder which is the Lord Jesus Christ. IF ANY DIAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE SIDI NOT."ŠJesus ekrist. VOLUME 13. NEW YORK, AUGUST 25, 1898. NUMBER 33. "SAY ye not, A con-federacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A con-federacy."ŠIsa. 8 :12. CHRISTIAN war fare aims to slay sin, but to save sin-ners; but carnal war-fare aims to kill the sin-ner in his sin. ALL men want to get t o heaven, but the trouble is with the great ma-jority that they want to get there in their own way. THE Tow-er of Babel THE Tow-er of Babel came thro-ugh human pride; the Ladder of Jac o b's dream thro-ugh divine humility. KEEP your con-science not on a gold basis, but a truth basis. IF man could as cend to hea-ven by his own works, he would but convert heaven into an earth by going there. THE worst fall a man ever gets is from the pinnacle of his pride; and theloft-ier men car-ry their tow- -approached as near to heaven as heathenism approaches er of babel, the worse will be the ruin in which it will fl- the righteousness of God. nally involve them.
