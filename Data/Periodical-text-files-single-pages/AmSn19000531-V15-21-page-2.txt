322 THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. citizens. We cite as an illustration the following from "Lord's Day Papers," a publication of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day association. The doctrine, as will be observed, is put forth to serve the cause of Sunday enforcement "Day. What right has the law to say how I shall spend Sunday more than any other day, and what good will result from Sunday law ?" "Ellis. It is the business of the law to protect our rights. We have each, for example, a right to life, lib-erty, and the pursuit of happiness. "Day. That is the very thing I believe in, person-al liberty. "Ellis. But not liberty to take away another's rights. Law may always curtail any one's liberty so far as it infringes on thq rights of others. My person-al liberty ends when it meets your rights. If a state or country believes that every one has a right to a weekly rest day, that it is a very valuable right, and that many will be deprived of it, unless law protects them, it becomes duty to make and enforce laws for this object. The people of this country do so believe and practice. ".Day. Although I do not altogether agree with them, I must admit that right, since majorities must rule ; but I cannot admit the right of law to recognize Sunday as a religious day, or to enforce it as such. "Ellis. If the mass of the people believe it a holy day and use it for worship, they have a right to pro-tection from disturbances. Law has no right to say how you shall spend Sunday or any other day, and does not attempt it. It does tell many things you may not do on any day, and more that you may not do on Sunday, because they conflict with the rights of others. "Day. Do I understand you to admit that law ought never to interfere with my action, unless by it I deprive some other individual of some right? "Ellis. I do not say quite that ; for the law must work on general principles, and beyond individual rights lies the general welfare. Our republic depends for its value and stability, not on armed force, but on the integrity and morality of its citizens ; and its first duty should be to protect and foster such integrity and morality. Every student of history knows that the Christian religion always produces the highest type of morality, and that Christian nations best guard the equal rights of all. Thus it becomes a patriotic duty to give such protection to the Sabbath as shall enable all classes, if they wish, to use the day for public wor-ship, and as shall give religious teachers a fair field for work as opposed to the teachers of greed and law-lessness." Note the statement that the "first duty" of the state is "to protect and foster integrity and morality" on the part of its citizens; and also that "the Christian religion always produces the highest type of morality." Taken together, these two statements amount to a declaration that the first duty of the state is to protect and foster the Christian religion, of which Sunday ob-servance is held to be an essential part. This is the impression conveyed to the mind of the reader, and  designed to be received by him. And when public sentiment is educated to the point of accepting it as the truth, it will sanction the enforcement of Sunday laws in every case, and under its deceptive light re-ligious persecution will appear and be sanctioned as a matter of civil necessity, to which only "teachers of greed and lawlessness" stand opposed. To the under-standing thus darkened, conscientious dissenters from this doctrine take on the appearance of criminals and enemies of the state, whose suppression by law is only a matter of regular prosecution for crime. Let public sentiment once become educated in this way, as wide-spread efforts are now being made to educate it, and strange scenes will be enacted in this erstwhile land of liberty and religious equality before the law. The doctrine that the state can of right define and "foster" morality is a fundamental error in the scheme of "Christian" government which the "moral reform" parties have in view. Once give the state power to define and punish immorality, and any religious dogma may be enforced in the alleged interests of morality. It is here taught, for example, that the dogma of Sun-day sacredness is essential to public morality, and with equal propriety the disregard of any other religious custom or practice might be prohibited as immoral. It might be decreed that the disregard of Thanks-giving day or of Christmas or Easter tends to im-morality, and their observance enforced accordingly. No separating line exists or can be drawn between morality and religion ; and when the state gets upon the domain of morality it will unavoidably trespass upon the field of religion, and religious legislation, with prosecution of dissentersŠthe old historical story of religious persecutionŠwill be the result. Therefore, the people need to be educated to a clearer understanding of the doctrine laid down at the founding of this Republic, that governments are in-stituted among men to preserve rights, and not to en-force human conceptions of moralityŠnot to stand be-tween the citizen and the one infallible Teacher of moral truth, to whom each individual of and for himself must give account. The question for the state is not, What is moral ? but What is an invasion of natural rights ? Let the state deal with the rights of its citizens in its appointed way, and God in his way can be safely trusted to deal with immorality. The doctrine that one man must surrender his right to work on Sunday because of another man's right to rest on that day, is an absurdity upon its face. Rights are equal, and one cannot overbalance another. The state is as much bound to protect the right to labor as to protect the right to rest. Every person has the right to stop work on Sunday, and each one has also the equal right to work on that day or engage in any lawful recreation; and this right can be ques-
