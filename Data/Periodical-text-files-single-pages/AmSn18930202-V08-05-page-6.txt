           ''COL. 8, No. 5.               in various numbers of your valuable paper, is too strong. It stated that "the" preachers of Toledo, St. Paul and other cities sought to enforce Sunday laws. The use of the definite article is erroneous, for there are to my certain knowledge in each of the places named preachers of our synod who did not, would not join such a movement, protested against it, refused co-operation, such as use of their churches for these meetings, etc. A more correct way of expressing it would be, "some," or "certain preachers," etc. Willingly the SENTINEL would do no in-justice, I know, therefore I call attention to it. I remain very respectfully yours, C. F. W. MEYER. quite enthusiastic in his remarks. He paid his respects to the directors of the Exposition in scathing language. He did. not hesitate to say that they were moved entirely by mercenary motives in asking that the Fair be opened, and that the two and a half millions given by Congress was being used by them in lobbying in favor of the anti-closing movement and paying the expenses of men to go to Washington and labor for its opening. He rang the usual changes about the demoralizing effect of Sunday excursions, etc., if the Fair should be opened on the so-called Lord's day. Said the reverend gentleman, " Open the gates on Sunday and there will be poured into the Fair the infernal ele-ment of Chicago, Springfield and other large cities, and those who visit Jackson Park on that day will simply see hell." The doctor was followed by Rev. Troxell, pastor of Grace Lutheran church of this city, who in the course of his re-marks thanked God for a Christian Chi-cago and Springfield ! The human mind will reflect, and we wondered how these cities could be " Christian," when accord-ing to Dr. McLean, there is an element in them " infernal " enough to manufacture a " hell " out of ! And how this can be a " Christian Nation" and we a " Chris-tian people" with such a vicious, depraved people among us. The resolutions were also spoken to by the pastors of the Presbyterian, Christian and Methodist churches, after which they were adopted by a rising vote. GEO. B. THOMPSON. Springfield, Ill. congress will come first, and will occupy a week or more. Many of the leading denominations of the country have already planned for these. The Congregationalists and Lutherans especially have arranged for these on an immense scale. Then a week has been assigned for the Evangelical Alli-ance, whose meetings will be of immense interest, etc. A number of our papersŠto say noth-ing of a conference or twoŠare in a state of excited sensibility on the subject as a crowd of school girls might be if invited to a swell wedding in a much decorated and very " tony ' church. The general superintendents of our church are ear-nestly called on by resolution and edito-rial assurance of "general approval " to see to it that the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, be represented at the great talking match and general " exhibit of the religions" of all nations. It is thought by some good people that it would be an irreparable calamity if Southern Methodism should not have a good place in the procession. We also must flaunt banners, beat drums, blow horns, and make other noises to let the world know that we are somewhat our-selves. It is even counted a sort of green- ness and narrowness not to see at once that we must be thereŠmaking for the eyes and ears of men an " exhibit" of our religionŠ" to be seen of men." There was a Teacher once who said terrible things about those who make a show of their piety; but men forget Him and his teaching. The Chicago management is without bias; all are invited, and upon terms of perfect equality. Protestants and Roman-ists, State churches and Free churches, Greek Church and Mohammedans, Bud-dhists and Touists, Trinitarians and Uni- tarians, Evangelicals and Univeisalists, Christians and idolaters, all are invited and begged to come. If any have been overlooked there has been no intention to be unfair. The "medicine man" of the Apaches should be thereŠas good as some of the rest; also the " rain-makers " Rider Haggard describes (from whom General Dyrenforth might get some valuable hints); also the priests of " Darkest Af-rica.' Why not the voodoo negroes of Louisiana swamps ? They could give a trick worth knowing to the Buddhist priests, to say the least of it. In some way the dead and gone reli-gions should be represented. There might be histrionic substitutes (a sort of pious theatre for church members; even preach-ers) for priests and teachers of Egypt and Assyria and Phenicia. They might at least build a duplicate of Nebuchadnez-zar's lofty statue of Bel-Merodach. The Greek and Roman temples should be re-produced, and learned men, personating the soothsayers, should show the moderns how to predict future events by watching the flight of birds or gazing upon the en-trails of a sheep. If the false religions are to be honored, give the dead ones a chance. And why not ask Herbert Spencer to make an " exhibit" of " agnosticism " ? A "complete exhibit of religions "! Was such a phrase ever penned before? What will be exhibited ? Doctrine ? Gov-ernment? Experience? What is there to show ? Will they debate doctrine, or set-tle disputed questions by arbitration ? Will they argue about government ? or tell experience ? or only brag about num-bers? If this last, the game is lost by Protestantism to the Romanists, by Chris-tianity to Mohammedanism, by all to bold and dirty heathenism. . . . The whole  Mass-Meeting in Springfield, ill. THE introduction of resolutions into both houses of the legislature now in session here in Springfield, asking Con-gress to repeal the Sunday-closing clause of the World's Fair appropriation, stirred up the so-called religious people of the city, and a mass-meeting was called Sun-day, January 15, to protest against such action being taken by our legislators. The meeting was held in the First M. E. Church, and although quite generally advertised the " mass " of assembled hu-manity did not exceed two hundred. The meeting was called to order by Rev. T. D. Logan, who introduced the follow- ing resolutions :Š WHEREAS, Resolutions have been presented in both branches of our State legislature, petitioning Congress to repeal the Sunday-closing condition upon which the sum of $2,500,000 was granted to the Columbian Exposition, Therefore, we, citizens of Springfield, assembled in mass-meeting, do most respectfully, yet earnestly, protest against any action being taken by the leg-islature, for the following reasons:Š FirstŠThe question of Sunday opening has not been regarded as a matter for State legislative action, and consequently the sentiments of the people have not been generally made known to the members of the legislature. On the other hand, petitions have been sent to Congress in great num-bers, including many thousands from the State of Illinois. The action of the last session was taken after mature deliberation ; it represents the prevail-ing sentiment of the people and ought to stand. SecondŠIt will be a glaring inconsistency for our legislature to petition Congress to do that which would lead to the violation of existing State laws. ThirdŠAn open Fair would lead to the running of special Sunday excursions, which would have a demoralizing influence upon the communities through which they pass, and pour into Chicago largely the vicious elements of society. FourthŠAn open Fair on Sunday will lead to a permanent increase of labor on that day, thus depriving wage-workers of their needed rest, and eventually compelling them to work seven days in order to hold their positions. FifthŠIt would be unpatriotic and un-American, and place us in a false light before the nations of the earth, which will expect us to show respect for national traditions and customs. This we have done in all European expositions by closing our exhibit on Sunday. SixthŠIt would encourage the spirit of anarchy which is even now rife in our large cities, threaten-ing the overthrow of our national institutions. SeventhŠIt would ignore the moral and religious alements of this State, inasmuch as they have freely expressed themselves in opposition to an open Fair on Sunday. EighthŠIt would be a violation of the law of God, which is supreme, and the foundation of all civil government. As such it ought to be respected and obeyed by our legislators, " as they that must give account." Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be sent to each member of the Senate and House of Representatives. Several speeches followed the reading of these resolutions. Rev. L. McLean, of Chi-cago, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was the chief speaker. He was      "A Complete Exhibit of Religions." [This article, by Bishop Atticus G. Haygood, which we abridge from the Nashville Christian Advocate, needs no comment. It is worthy of seri-ous thought.] THE humbug of our times is the pro-posed "congress of religions" to be held in Chicago in connection with the big show in September. . . . Having discovered Columbus, the Amer-ican people now propose to manifest them-selves to the world. . . . That noth-ing may be lacking, all the "religions of the world" are summoned to appear, make processions, exhibit inventories, give " reasons for the faith that is in them." . . . Over this " parliament " of all religions (Anglomaniacs prefer the English term to Congress) much ado is being made by sundry papersŠsome infidel and some "inclined to piety." The meeting will be for the most part taken up with palaver, tongue-fence, and brag. Yet the " Son of man " said : " The kingdom of heaven cometh not with ob-servation." Can even an unbeliever con-ceive of Him as making out a programme for such a conglomeration of orthodoxies and heresies, infidelities and heathenisms ? A marked copy of a paper, standing for the beliefs and history of the sect called Methodists, sent to this writer, gives a brief, broad statement of the great and " complete exhibit of religions." This paper says, and many write the same things :Š It is proposed to have in connection with the World's Fair a series of w orld conventions, repre-senting the chief departments of human knowl-edge and effort, and the principal one of these will be the congress of religions extending through the month of September, 1893, Halls and churches that will accommodate 80,000 will be found ready for this series of conventions, which will give a complete exhibit of the religious forces now shap-ing human thought and life.
