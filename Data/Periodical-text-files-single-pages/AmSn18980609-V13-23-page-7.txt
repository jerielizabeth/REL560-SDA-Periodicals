  AMEHICAN SEN TIN EL. 359         brain in the only way which can yield a nation of men. He is matching human against humanŠnot man against brute." No one having the slightest acqaintance with the subject will wonder that football was shunned in this connection, notwithstanding its "wide popularity." It is virtually admitted, however, to be as much the Ameri-can game as baseball, but whether it be admitted or not, we know that it is. It has all the virtues here ascribed to baseball. The game is too notorious and the tragic results of its "training of good human muscle" and its "matching of human against human" too fresh in our memories to require details here. Suffice it to say that during the last season eleven deaths, not to mention all the accompanying evils and minor brutalities, were re-ported in a short time, and one state was sufficiently aroused to abolish the game by rendering it a criminal offense. An investigation of the details will not lead anyone to question the statement in the editorial under discus-sion, that "no bull-fighting nation on earth ever could come creditably out of a war with ball-players." There is one point in this connection that we wish to emphasize. With all their boasting the Spaniards have not, to our knowledge, pointed to the picadors and banderilleros of the bull-fight as the representatives of either their honor or their bravery, and we do not believe they rep-resent the little intelligence with which Spain is credited. But the names and achievements of the "rushers" and "backs" of the American game of football, together with the accounts of the deaths, maimings, and injuries occa-sioned by tham, are invariably connected with such names as Yale, Harvard, Brown, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and the various state universities. On the one hand we have the ignorant matador tormenting and slaying an animal in the arena; on the other we have the inmates of the highest educational institutions of this country, who are supposed to be basking in the full blaze of our en-lightenment, and enjoying the very heights of its attain-ments, trampling over and kicking each other on the football ground almost in the shadow of those institu-tions. Is that a spectacle to be held up with pride as an svidence of our superior civilization? It would seem that all ordinary motives of humanity and self-respect would have led us, instead of glorying in this our shame, to have sought with averted gaze to cover the deformity. To what lamentable lengths do we go when determined to ignore the truth, and to substitute "gross darkness" where there is the clearest light. There is another sport which has attained a "wide popularity" in this country and which also possesses the virtues mentioned above. In it the contestants meet "on equal terms of intelligence [which isn't saying a 'reat deal] and muscle and training." They "match human against humanŠnot man against brute," and they consider that they are using muscle and brain in a way which will show them to be "men." And it is not boo much to say that many a youth from New York to San Francisco aspires to be just such a "man," and that he, too, "dreamsŠsleeping and wakingŠof the hero in the ring, and imbibes in infancy, cultivates in growth, ,and exercises in manhood the essentials of the ideal character" fully as much as does any lad between BarceŁ lona and Cadiz. It need not be said that the sport to which we r•fer is prize-fighting. The fame of the light and heavy weights of Spain has never reached us, but reliable statistics on prize fighting show that thirty-one pugilists have been killed in the arena between the years 1832 and 1897, and of these deaths, three occurred in England and the remaining twenty-eight in this country. No credit need be taken from the fact that the time ex-tends back to 1832. Nine of these deaths occurred in 1897, and the whole twenty-eight in this country have occurred since 1876. It may be that there is more bru-tality in matching "man against brute" with "tremen-dous advantage" in favor of the man, than there is in matching "human against human" with the deliberate intention and expectatiOn that one or the other will be cruelly maimed if not killed outright; but a person of average sensibility will not be able to realize it. To our mind it is "man's inhumanity to man" that is the great offense, and in that respect we think this country will have little difficulty in maintaining its reputation with Spain. There is something else which sometimes occurs in this country, and which has an important bearing in determining the relative brutality and cowardice of the Spanish and American people. In it "human is matched against human" and in one respect it closely resembles the description of the bull-fightŠ"tremendous advan-tage" is on one side. But it is not necessary that we should add to the horrors of this list those of lynch law. Nor need we add many other things which properly be-long in this category. We are by no means defending the bull fights of Spain. We regard them as both cruel and cowardly. In fact, we know of but one thing which exceeds in barbarity the cruel and wanton destruction of animal life, and that is the cruel and wanton destruction of human life, whether it be on the football ground, in the prize ring, or on the deck of a man-of-war. The one exceeds the other in bru-tality just to the extent that the life of a human being is of more value than that of an animal The plain truth is that by nature and of himself the Spaniard and the American is one and the same. The average American goes to the football game or a prize-fight for exactly the same reason that he goes to war, or that the Spaniard goes to a bull-fightŠbecause he expe-riences a certain infatuation and delight in seeing life and limb risked in a brutal encounter. But notwithstanding the fact that all men are of "one blood," there have been certain great influences which have operated for the ele-vation of the one nation and the degradation of the other. Next week we shall point out those influences by quoting from an authority who has investigated deeper than the "play hour and the manner of its spending."
