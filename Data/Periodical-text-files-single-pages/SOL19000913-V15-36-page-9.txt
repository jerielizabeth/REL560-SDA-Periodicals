THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. 569 TOO TRANSPARENT. AN order has been issued from the Boston police headquarters to the captains of the various divisions giving explicit instructions concerning the Sunday law, quoting from the public statutes and urging them to see that the law is not violated, commenc-ing with August the 26th ult. The notice sent out was in part as follows: "Acts of 1895, chapter 434, section 2, provide a penalty for whoever, on the Lord's day, keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any man-ner of labor, business or work, except works of nec- essity and charity.' . - . . "'Whoever conscientiously believes that the sev-enth day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall not be liable to the pen-alties of this section for performing secular business and labor on the Lord's day if he disturbsŁno other person.' "Although upon a hasty reading it might not be apparent, this exception as to those who conscien-tiously believe that the seventh day ought to be observed as the Sabbath, etc., is limited to the pro-hibition against labor, business and work, and does not apply to the prohibition against keeping open one's shop, workhouse or warehouse. " See commonwealth vs. Starr, 144 Mass., 359; also commonwealth 'vs. Hass, 122 Mass., 40Š' Even if one conscientionsly believes that the seventh day ought to be observed as the Sabbath and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, he cannot on that account legally keep his shop open for business on Sunday.'" It will be seen from the foregoing that Boston is holding her own on the question of enforcing the Sunday laws. The point, however, that I wish to notice in this connection is that the exemption clauses which are held up by some Sunday-law advocates, are but little more than such in name, as will be seen from the above. It is said that there is no desire on the part of the Sunday-law crusaders to deprive any of their liberties, and in evidence of their sincerity they offer exemption clauses to those who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. Were the princi-ple underlying Sunday laws and the offering of ex-emption clauses for those observing the seventh day a right one, it could even then be seen how transparent these exemptions are by examining the one here referred to in the Massachusetts Sunday law, for it specifies those who " actually " refrain  from secular business and labor on the seventh day,Ł and says further that such an individual can labor'  on Sunday only on condition that " he disturbs no' other person." I once heard of a person who was,  disturbed because another person was setting type' in an upper room several squares away on Sunday.. It can be seen from this illustration that such ex-emptions only render a person a helpless prey to the prejudices of any.who may not agree with him religiously. But you will observe that this Massachusetts Sunday law has been found, on technical examina-tion,,  to forbid even the " exempted " Seventh-day observer the right to keep open his shop, workhouse or warehouse on Sunday. We can but conclude that such exemptions are but a thin veil to cover up the real object of the Sunday law movement until the sentiment in its favor be-comes so universal that there will be no policy in having exemptions for any, even in name. K. C. RUSSELL. THE whole tendency of the times is to make us act by the standard of what others do. We throw over the wall of our character the tangled plumb line of other lives and reject the infallible test which Amos saw. The question for me should not be what you think is right, but what God thinks is right. This perpetual reference to the behavior of others as though it decided anything but human fallibility is a mistake as wide as the world. There are ten thousand pumb lines in use, but only one is exact. and that is the Tine of God's eternal right. There is a mighty attempt being made to reconstruct and fix up the Ten Commandments. To many they seem too rigid. My friends, we must have a standard; shall it be God's or man's?ŠRev. T. DeWitt Talmage. THE English Churchman and St. James Chronicle cites the fact that there are, or.were quite recently, 170 French Jesuits laboring in China, and then says: "Wherever the Jesuits go they stir up strife and quarrelling, not only between Romanists and Prot-estants, but also between Romanists and Romanists. Pope Clement XIV., in his bull suppressing the Jesuit Order, declared that several Roman Catholic kings had previously been compelled to expel the Jesuits in order to prevent the Roman Catholics rising in the very bosom of their church and mur-dering one another."
