REST FROM LABORŠSHOULD IT BE COEI?CEDP 149 of immorality, is gratuitously assumed. The question now.  occurs : What right or legitimate authority has the legislature to enact a law to coerce the observance of a prescribed day or time of rest from labor as a political or secular measure! I am not inclined to interpose any in-surmountable objection to a stated day of general rest from labor, merely as a political regulation ; but how far our legislature has a constitutional or dele-gated right to pass coercive enactments on the subject is not so clear as perhaps it may be thought to be by those who have never heard their authority called in question, or the policy or the wisdom of the measures even doubted. It will not be pretended that there is any express provision in the constitution delegating any authority of the kind in question. The authority of the legisla-ture, therefore, if it has any, must be implied; that is, it must be necessarily in-cidental to the power expressly given. Man dearly loves his ease, and when left to himself he would be more inclined to rest too long than work too much. If left to do as he pleases, or in other phrase, to do what nature dictates to be done in regard to work and rest, he will not destroy himself by excessive labor, nor starve to death in preference to pro-curing by his exertions the means of sustaining life and adding to its com-forts. It is only when he is not left to himself to obey the demands of nature in the matter of rest and labor, that statute laws may be rightfully interposed to preserve his rights and to protect him in his obedience to the law of nature in respect to toil and rest. The employers being allowed by law the proceeds of the labor of their servants, apprentices and dependents might, as has often happened, through avarice, caprice, or want of proper feeling or reflection, unreason-ably withhold from them their just rights and privileges. When they impose on  their dependents labor much too hard or heavy, or too long continued ; when they allow no time, or not sufficient, for natural and indispensable, rest or sleep, as also when the employer neglects or refuses to furnish good and wholesome food and sufficient of it, civil govern-ment not only has the right, but is in duty bound by the primary principles on which it is instituted, to interfere to pre-vent such injuries and to protect the servant, the apprentice, or other depend-ent, in the enjoyment of his natural and inalienable right to rest when nature im-periously demands it, and to restrain the master from such acts of cruelty and gross injustice, and compel him to the performance of his moral obligation not to injure those who are subject to his will and power. The legislature, there-fore, has the right to prescribe the time when the employer may and when he shall not oblige his dependents to do their work.* And when religious sects (as often, and indeed too often, it has happened), feeling the physical power derived from their numbers alone, and heedless of the just and equal rights of others, have forced them to suspend their useful labor and keep religious sabbaths unknown to and unacknowledged by the consciences or religious system of the weaker sect, the legislature not only has the right inferred from the contemplated objects for which civil governments were instituted, but is bound in duty, by the primary principles on which free govern-ments are founded, to interfere, not to force its constituents to keep a religious day of rest, but to prevent any from coercing others to keep more religious * Of course the clerks and others who are to-day demanding the enforcement of a weekly rest day are in no such dependent situation as is here described, and hence their situation does not call for any such interference as is demanded in the case of such dependents as are referred to.Šturroa.
