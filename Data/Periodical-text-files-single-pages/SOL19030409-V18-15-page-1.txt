A Point of "Capital" Importance with the Papacy A Question of Principle and not of Numbers PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, APRIL 9, 1903 NO. 15 Must a people wait till they constitute a majority before they have the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience, and when they get to be the majority are they to legislate for the minority in religious matters? See Page 23o. The principles of our government do not recognize in the majority any authority over the minority, except in matters which regard the conduct of man to his fellow-man. . . . The Constitution regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian, and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary indi-vidual than that of a whole community. ŠCommittee on Postoffices and Post-roads, U. S. House of Representatives, 1830. The obligation of government is the same on both these classes I first and seventh-day observers]; and the commit-tee can discover no principle on which the claims of one should be more respected than those of the other; unless it be admitted that the consciences of the minority are less sacred than those of the majority. . . . What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any por-tion of citizens, however small. ŠCommittee on Postoffices and Post-roads, U. S.
