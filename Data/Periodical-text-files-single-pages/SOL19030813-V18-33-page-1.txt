The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, AUGUST 13, 1903 NO. 33 "Think no man the better, no man the worse, for the church he belongs to. Try him by his fruits. Expel from your breast the demon of sectarianism, narrowness, bigotry, intolerance. Shun it as from hell. Look with undimin-ished joy on goodness, though it shine forth from the most adverse sect. Set up nothing above the virtue of the heart and the life. Goodness, purity, virtueŠlet these be su-preme. To imagine that God regards anything but this, that He looks at anything but the heart, is to dishonor Him, to be mournfully insensible to His character. To confine His love or His good Spirit to any party, sect, or name is to sin against the fundamental law of His kingdom. . . . What is the grand error of Roman Catholicism?ŠIt is its narrow church-spirit, its blind sectarianism, its condemna-tion and exclusion from God's favor of virtuous, pious men because they do not conform to certain rites and accept certain doctrines." Let not those who oppose Roman Catholicism have their attitude toward its adherents, from the lowest to the highest, influenced and determined by that for which it is chiefly to be abhorred. --Ł The Individual Responsible Only to41  God in Religion PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 11 West 20th St., New York City OAKLAND.
