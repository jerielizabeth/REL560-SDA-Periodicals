164 LIBERTY Like most propositions, when first pre-sented the proposed law for Sunday rest contains many exemptions. Special privileges are accorded to those engaged in the carrying on of sports, theaters, and amusements, to keep open doors seven days in the week, though general business and legitimate manufacturing and commercial houses are debarred from such advantages.

Thus a system of espionage is proposed, with the opportunities for blackmail which always exists in such matters; and a large number of the signatures required to place this iniquitous proposition upon the ballot were publicly , secured in the churches, on the appeals of ministers who have entered into this conspiracy against the natural rights and constitu-tional liberties of citizens. Naturally, fair-minded men are incensed at such a proposed inquisition. Notwithstanding the extreme liberality with which the proposed exemptions from the operation of the law are sprin-kled through the bill, the constitution of California declares that " no special priv-ileges or immunities shall ever be granted which may not be altered, revoked, or
