EDITORIAL NOTE AND COMMENT 393 by the supreme tribunal of the nation, and now declared by leading journals as likely to be the " controlling " doctrine of " the court in the future, no matter ,how constituted " It [the majority opinion] assumes the pos-session by Congress of power quite as omnip-otent as that possessed by the English parlia-ment. It assumes that Congress, which came into existence only by virtue of the Consti-tution, may withhold the fundamental guaran-ties of life and liberty from peoples who have ' come ilnder our complete jurisdiction, and over whose country we have acquired the au-thority to exercise sovereign dominion. In my judgment, neither the life nor the liberty nor the property of any person within a territory or country over which the United States is sovereign can be taken under the sanction of any civil tribunal, by any form of procedure inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States. Can it be that the Constitution is the supreme law in the States of the Union, and in the organized Territories of the United States between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and yet was not the supreme law in territories and among peoples situated like the Territory and people of Hawaii, and over which the United States acquired all rights of sovereignty of whatsoever kind? A negative answer to this question and a recognition of the prin-ciple that such an answer involves, would mean that the benefit of the provisions designed for the protection of life and liberty , may be claimed by some of the people subject to the authority and jurisdiction of the United States, but cannot be claimed by others equally subject to its authority and juris-diction. It would mean that the will of Congress, not the Constitution, was the su-preme law of the land for certain peoples and territories under our jurisdiction. It would mean that the United States may acquire terri-tory by cession, conquest or treaty, and that Congress may exercise sovereign dominion over it, outside of and in violation of the Constitution. It would mean that, under the influence and guidance of commercialism and the supposed necessities of trade, this country had left the old ways of the fathers, as defined by written constitution, and entered a new way, in follow-ing which the American people will lose sight of or become indifferent to those principles which had been supposed to be essential to real liberty. 'It would mean that if this people do not retrace their steps, if the principles now an-nounced should become firmly established, the time may not be far distant when, under the exactions of trade and commerce, and to grat-ify an ambition to become the greatest political power in all the earth, the United States will acquire territories in every direction which are inhabited by human beings, over which territories, to be called " dependencies," we will exercise absolute dominion, and where inhab-itants will be regarded as " subjects," to be controlled as Congress may see fit, not as the Constitution requires nor as the people gov-erned people may wish. Thus will be engrafted upon our republican institutions, dominated by the supreme law of a written constitution, a colonial system en-tirely foreign to the genius of our govern-ment end abhorrent to the principles that un-derlie and pervade the Constitution. I stand by the doctrine that the Constitution is the supreme law in every territory as soon as it comes under the sovereign dominion of the United States for purposes of civil ad-ministration, and whose inhabitants are under its entire-  authority and jurisdiction. Of course the decision of the court is " a negative answer " to Justice Harlan's interrogation, and from it logically fol-lows all that he points out. The Spring-field Republican says : According to the position of the majority judges, the Constitution is wholly without force or effect upon Congress in dealing with any territory or people under the jurisdiction of the United States and not embraced in the regular States of the Union; and an imperial system of colonies or dependencies can be engrafted upon the Republic, subject to a gov-ernment as absolute and despotic and arbitrary as that of the Czar. To say that this is in harmony with the principles and system  of government intended to be established by the Constitution of the United States is to violate the dictates of common reason and common sense. ≈Å An incident in President Roosevelt's late Western trip that should not be over-looked took place at Seattle, Wash.
