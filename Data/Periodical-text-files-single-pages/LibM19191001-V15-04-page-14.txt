KING CHARLES II Whose Reign Gave to England and Her Colonies the Sunday Law from Which Our American Sunday Statutes Have Been De-rived. 92 LIBERTY position so far as the principle of self-determi-nation is concerned, for that position is Ameri- can. Our President and his cocommissioners stuck to the American text, and it is to be hoped that in the reconstruction work proposed for America they will continue to apply these principles by refusing to forge shackles of intolerance sug-gested in proposed Sunday leg-islation. Was compulsory Sunday ob-servance among the things against which early Congresses warned? Let the House of Representatives of the Twenty-first Congress, first session, March 4, 5, 1830, answer: Ł " If Congress shall, by au-thority of law, sanction the measure recommended, it would constitute a legislative decision of a religious controversy, in which even Christians them-selves are at issue. [The meas-ure referred to was a proposed statute stopping the mails on Sunday.] . . . If the measure recommended should be adopted, it would be difficult for human sagacity to foresee how rapid would be the succession, or how numerous the train of measures which follow, involving the dearest rights of all Š the rights of conscience. " It is perhaps fortunate for our country that the proposition [stopping the mails on Sunday by civil law Š looked upon as a dan-gerous and un-American precedent] should have been made at this early period, while the spirit of the Revolution yet exists in full vigor." Should not our Sixty-sixth Congress stick to the text of the Constitution and the attitude of the early Congresses by keeping the legis-lative doors closed against proposed Sunday laws, the operation of which means, in the last analysis, fettering our citizenry with the shackles of intolerance against which our patriotic forefathers consistently battled? Is it not time for our civil authorities to advise in the language of the Senate report above quoted, those who advocate Sunday laws in nation or State: " Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion, for enforcing reli-gious observances. Let the professors of Christianity rec-ommend their religion by deeds of benevolence, by Christian meekness, by lives of temper-ance and holiness. Let them combine their efforts to instruct the ignorant, to relieve the widow and the orphan, to pro-mulgate to the world the gospel of their Saviour, recommending its precepts by their habitual example; government will find its legitimate object in protect-ing them. It cannot oppose them, and they will not need its aid. Their moral influence will then do infinitely more to advance the true interests of religion, than any measure which they may call on Congress to enact." This is sound American doctrine. Keep the church and state forever separate. miiiiiniiiiiiimilimiiiiiiiiiiimiliiiiiimmionimmiumingiiiiiiiiiiiimmiliiiimmomiiiiminwiliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinminsummuilimiliiinimonnimmiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiimiq_3] E 1 m g g M Church and State in the Fourth Century An Echo from the First Nicene Council El 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111l11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110111111 IN the early years of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great and the lead-ing bishops of the West were conspiring together to effect an organic union of all the churches of Christendom, both East and West, and also to bring about a complete union of church and state, with Constantine the Great as its head in place of Christ, that emperor called the ecumenical council of Nicfea in a supreme effort to bring about harmony in both church and state under his leadership, and abolish forever the fundamental principles of primitive Christianity. Among those whom Constantine had com-manded to attend this council was Arius, an aged presbyter of Alexandria, who held tena-ciously to many principles of the apostolic faith, and refused to take any part in the delibera-tions of the council, lest by so doing he should recognize the right of an emperor to call such a council of the leaders of the church, and, as head of the state, assume also dominating lead-ership in the church. But during the discussion of certain vital questions in the proposed creed concerning which Arius had been accused of heresy, Con-
