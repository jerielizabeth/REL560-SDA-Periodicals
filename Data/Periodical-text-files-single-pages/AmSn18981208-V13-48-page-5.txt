AMERICAN SENTINEL. 761 says that the benediction will give the same benefits to those who see it in the Mutoscope as if they actually re-ceived it from the holy father in person." And no doubt they will, every bit! Notes from the W. C. T. U. Convention. * * * THE proceedings of, the National Woman's Christian Temperence Union, which closed November 16, in St. Paul, Minn., reveals the fact that this organization is composed of a band of women gathered from every state in the Union, and from almost every nation upon earth, who have not only set their faces as a flint against wrong, but who know the nature of the wrong against which they are battling, and whose tender hearts, and loving hands reach out to every human life. The past year has been an eventful one for several reasons. The death of Miss Willard, February 17, caused a shock and gloom to fall on the organization such as it has never before realized, but each woman soon rallied to the support of the vice-president, and, as was often expressed, instead of Miss Willard's mantle falling upon any one person, each individual feels a new sense.of re-sponsibility to follow her as she followed Christ, and strive to make the work she loved a greater power for the good of humanity. The retiring of the Temple Trust bonds was another event which caused considerable excitement, and will dis-tinguish the past year from all others. The noble woman who was the builder of the temple, and who has stood so bravely-for its interests through the bitter opposition of the past few years, is by no means discouraged even if the W. C. T. U. have dropped the temple as an affiliated interest, and determines to continue her work until the building is free of debt, and seems confident of success. The reports from the different states showed quite an increase in membership during the past year. Indi-ana excelled all the other states in this respect, having gained one thousand new-members. The finances of the organization are in a prosperous condition. The reports from the various departments in the organization were full of interesting incidents, and show that a systematic work is going on for soldiers, sail-ors, and railroad officials. A vigorous effort is being made in behalf of purity in art and literature, and also to secure a law for the protection of Sunday observance. The national superintendent of the "Sabbath Observ-ance" Department said, "There is no hope of destroying the Christian religion so long as the Christian Sabbath is acknowledged and kept by men as a sacred day. Hereafter the week following Easter week will be known as the week of prayer for the preservation and better observance of the Sabbath. This year we sent out 18,-000 of our Lord's day leaflets-5,000 more than have ever been used before." Dr. W. F. Crafts, who is quite prominent in W. C. T. U. ranks and conventions, stated that the reason he was present was because he could get more cooperation from them in his work than from any other organization in this country; for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is the most aggressive body in making laws, and in getting them enforced, in the world. He said: "We are threatened, as a nation, by many evils, and not the least among these is the increased consumption of li-quor, which is increasing at twice the rate of increase in population murders, lynchings, and municipal corrup-tion. Sabbath-breaking, impurity and corrupt journal-ism are threatening evils. There are three necessities of life in a republicŠintelligence, conscientiousness and a spirit of equality. In order to develop these the relation of master and servant must be broken every week by general observance of the Sabbath; and the day must also be protected from dissipation, that there may be opportunity for the mental and moral improvement of the masses. The Sabbath, as observed in Great Britain and the really American parts of America, makes men; while the holiday Sunday keeps the people that have it in childhood, forever at play." It is a great cause of regret to the women that they are not yet permitted to wield the ballot, but they de-termined to persevere in their efforts to obtain this priv-ilege. Mrs. Lillian M. N. Stevens, of Maine, was elected president of the organization, and Miss Anna A Gordon, of Illinois, vice-president, this being in harmony with the choice indicated by Miss Willard before her death. The Church and State System in Utah. THE Mormon system has been from the first a system which united church and state; like the papacy, it has made the church supreme in both religious and civil af-fairs. And in this respect Mormonism remains to-day what it was in the days of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. Under the control of this system, the territory of Utah was received into the Union as a sovereign state. The nation refused to receive polygamy, and compelled this (as it thought) to be thrown out; but it took in a union of church and state. And now it is discovering that this church-and-state system was the real evil of Mormonism, and the real argument against receiving the territory controlled by it into the Union. For it is now seen that the Mormon Church rules in Utah, and that under its rule the baneful branch of polygamy which was lopped off from the parent tree by the sword of the civil power, is budding into new life, and bids fair to de-velop again as of old. Upon this point the New York Independent, under the heading "Mormonism Again a Foe," speaks the following:Š "There has been a disposition among the Christian
