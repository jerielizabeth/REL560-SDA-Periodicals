Read what Others Say of it: "Many books have been written about the glorious and wondrous story of the Sierras. But it seems to me that this scholarly and venerable pioneer, who was publishing an illustrated magazine devoted largely to the themes he celebrates, when many of the younger authors were still at their nurse's knee, is the one man who is entitled, by his culture, his fine tastes, and, above all, his long and wonderful experience, to write the one great and responsible authority about the Heart of the Sierras."-JOA QUIN MILLER, the Noted Author and Correspondent. "The illustrations, the text, the whole atmo-phere of the volume, are worthy of their great subject, the Yo Semite-and what could I say more? "-REV. JOSEPH COOK, of Boston. "It is a truthful, interesting, and instructive work."-GALEN CLARK, PO Semite Valley. (For sixteenyears the Valley's Guardian.) "As might have been expected, Mr. Hutchings' story of the Valley that he knows and loves so well, is no cold description, but reads with all the charms cf a romance."-San Francisco Hotel Gazette. "Those who have not seen Yo Semite cannot do better, short of going to the Valley, than by purchasing Mr. Hutchings' handsome volume."-The Sacramento Record-Union.
