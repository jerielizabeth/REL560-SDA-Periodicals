Let us seek the real cause of the failure of civil government in America, the land of the free and the home of the brave. I f the American citizen will but open his eyes and look, he will perceive an Old Man of the Sea on the neck of our gov-ernment, national, State, and municipal, who will undoubtedly remain there until destroyed. This Old Man of the Sea is the liquor traffic. The liquor traffic, united with preda-tory wealth, the two being brought to-gether by old party political machines, is the real root of bad government. This is the force that brings to naught every re-form scheme. Most men see only predatory wealth at the bottom of our evil political and economic conditions. If these men will only look deeper, they will see predatory wealth getting its power from the baser elements of society through the saloon system. Were the Socialist party to get the reins of government, harboring as it does the present liquor traffic, the traffic would demand protection and get it. It would then become the nucleus around which would be organized politically, as now, all the evil elements of society, and this organization would find socialism a great deal easier to control than society as now organized. As just stated, no greater misfortune could happen to the Socialists than to come into power with the Old Man of the Sea prominent in their organization. But doubtless the reader is asking what proof or explanation can be adduced to show that the liquor traffic is the cause 140 of the political evils we see all around us. As regards capital engaged, men em- ployed, and product, it is only a small part of business. Whence, then, is its power and influence? The explanation is not difficult. It is the same as that of the control of large corporations by a few men with relatively small capital. The good people of the land are di-vided among four political parties. The bad people are composed largely of the vicious wealthy and the vicious poor. The vicious wealthy have the " sinews of war," and the vicious poor have the votes. All that is needed to control elections is to swing the votes of about one tenth of our voting population. This is a com-paratively easy matter. Predatory wealth easily provides the funds out of its vast stores, the political machines of the old parties take them, go to the saloons with promises of money, or the equivalent, for votes, and immunity from prosecution for the saloon-keeper himself, and get what they want. The men who are elected to office, whether executives, leg-islators, or judiciary, know they owe their election to the wealth that provided the funds and the saloons that provided the changed votes, and act accordingly after the election. But suppose again it is asked, What is the evidence of this condition? The answer is, This evidence is on every hand piled mountain high. Almost any voter can give evidence from his own experience or observation. Every newspaper publishes matter almost daily which would prove it, were the whole story back of the items made known. The conduct of practically all our can-didates for office proves it. They dare
