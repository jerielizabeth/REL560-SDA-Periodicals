The liege Case≈†Christianity Not Guilty PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., DECEMBER 10. 1903 NO. 49 The religion which asserts itself 'with physical force is not Christianity., no matter Irhat it may call itself. Legislators are as much out of place in"exempting" peo-ple from obseribing a day as in requiring them to observe one. "Civil law must not coerce individual action nor curtail individual liberty until they become definitely antagonistic to the general good." "True religion is imparted by example, lobe, and per- suasion. Souls are not drtben into the path of righteoueness or into the kingdom of God." glitch of the iniquity of a Sunday law is in its enforce- ment of the observance of a religious holy day. The "usual exemption" clause for seventh-day observers does not take away a particle of this iniquity, even in their cases. They are simply given the alternati"be of observing one of Iwo days. But legislators hate no right to require people to ob- serve either the seventh or the first day of the week, and they have no right as an alternatilre to compelling people to observe one day to require them to observe another. The matter of the obser?,ance of Sunday or any other day by the people is something with which the civil authorities by right can ha'be nothing whatever to do.
