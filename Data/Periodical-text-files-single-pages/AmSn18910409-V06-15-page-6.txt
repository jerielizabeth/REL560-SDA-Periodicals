118 TT:TE SENTINEL.             question, "What is the Sabbath ?" will be discussed, and in the light of the answer given we hope to find the true grounds of reform.Š Lux Benigna, in Bloomington ( Ill.) Bulletin. -Ł^0-Ł Religious Persecution. R. M. KING, of Obion county, Tennes-see, was arrested in March, 1890, and fined seventy-five dollars for working in his own field on Sunddy. The Judge and the prosecuting attorneys, as well as the neighbors, have declared that if Mr. King and his brethren continue to labor on Sunday, they will have to leave the State. Mr. King was arrested the third time last June; he says, " I went out in the morn-ing and hoed six rows of potatoes, work-ing just about one hour, then went to hear the Methodist minister preach, was arrested .Monday, and fined five dollars and costs." In the same neighborhood on the same day, there was a man cutting grain with a binder, working the neces-sary hands to shock it, but there was no complaint made of his breaking the Sab-bath. Mr. King can see from the jail windows men working on Sunday, but there is nothing said about it ; of all the prosecutions for Sunday breaking in Dyer County, of which there have been a considerable number in the past eighteen months, not one arrest has been made outside the number of those who are ac-knowledged conscientious Christian men. If it is true that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, is it not equally true, if we would preserve our own liberties, we must respect the rights of others ? If Christians as Christians would leave the civil laws alone, and take the Bible for their creed, the conflict with sin would be shorter, sharper, more conclusive, and glorious.Š,T. H. Sargeant, in Leader, Long Prairie. .Minn. On Sunday Laws. IT is very strange indeed, that in this day of progress and general enlightenment, any person, or sect of persons, should be so narrow-minded as to set forth and teach doctrines and principles that char-acterized the Dark Ages. To compel peo-ple to do a thing on the first day of the week, and in which they do not believe, is but one form of tyranny. Is this syn-onymous with the American boast of free Goverrinient ? We think not. Although we were brought up to revere and keep the first day of the week, we feel it would be wrong to force our views upon those who might differ with us in a religious point of view, or holding to contrary con-victions. George Washington declared that the United States were not founded on the Christian religion. The American Re-public has never claimed the right or privilege to inquire into the religious views of its citizens any more than it has  to punish any one of them for exercising his elective franchise. What our neigh-bors may think, can not affect us, so long as their actions are confined within the common rules or regulations of rights and morality. An attempt to legislate on the Sunday law would be the first step toward the union of Church and State, a union that has done more to sacrifice and destroy the the lives of innocent men and women, than the political blunders of all the world combined. For our part we shall oppose such measures as undemocratic, and shall aim with a direct purpose to de-feat the thrust at American liberty with all our power.ŠYolo (Cal.) Democrat. Ł In Russia.

THERE are several reasons why, in our judgment, the clergy should_ not take an active part in political organization; even if it be dubbed non-pdrtisan. They are not often skillful organizes of practical movements. Their functibn is to teach truth not to conduct affairs; and while occasionally the same man is equally good at both, more frequently the man who drops the first function to undertake the second, 'drops a higher for a lower office, and he who undertakes to fulfill both fulfills neither. The American peo-ple are jealous of the interference of the clergy in political administration. The attempt to carry on the State by the Church has been very thoroughly tried in the Old World, and the success of the experiment has not been such as to en-courage a repetition of it in the New World. Cardinals have not purified state-craft in France, nor have bishops sanc-tified the House of Lords in England. Ministers are but men, and when they drop the vantage ground which their pro-fession gives them for quiet and unselfish reflection and enter the environment of other men, they become much like them. If the minister goes into politics, he is certain to take concern for his church with him, and then the question often stares him in the face between service of the Church or the State, the two not infrequently seeming to present conflicting claims upon him.ŠChristian Union. - INTOLERANCE is the shadow which dogs the footsteps of faith, and in Many cases more than obscures its benefits.ŠLaing. A Sunday Question. REV. THOMAS C EASTON is apparently not above begging the question when he wants to make a point. " We are con-fessedly a Christian people," he said yes-terday, and then he proceeded to argue that therefore the Columbian Exposition should be closed on Sunday. We do not see why, even were this confessedly a Christian Nation, the Exposition should be closed on Sunday, for we fail to under-, stand how such a display would dishonor the day. We are certain that all over the land places that dishonor week days as well as Sundays are allowed to keep open all the year round. But this is not a con-fessedly Christian people, and Dr. Easton will find no such statement or confeskon in our Constitution. The fact is that the clergymen of Chicago want to gather the crowds of visitors into their churches every Sunday, and receive on their collec-tion plates the Money that would other-wise be spent at the Exposition. So, of course, the clergy all over the country lend them a fraternal helping hand. We do not blame them either. But they should debate the question fairly.ŠSan Francisco Daily Report. A CITY has clearly the right to see that no disorderly conduct is indulged in within the corporate limits on Sunday or any other day. Whether it has the right to stop an orderly game of baseball, or of any other kind that is not in itself im-moral, is another question. --Gilpin County Observer. The law can compel no man or congre-gation of men to observe Sunday as a re-ligious day. The right to worship is left with the individual, as well as the object which lie desires to worship. A town has a perfect right to maintain peace and qui-etude within its corporate limits. If base-ball playing on Sunday is indulged to the annoyance of the citizens it can be abated as a nuisance, after the nuisance is proven. Such testimony, however, must necessa-rily be direct, positive, and from persons living in the immediate vicinity of the place where the game is played. The same evidence would suspend baseball playing in the same location on any other day of the week. In other words, a nui-sance on Sunday is as much a nuisance on Monday.ŠColorado Graphic. STRANGE as it may appear, in this age of enlightenment, and this land of free-dom, there are some who seem not yet to have broken through the shell of error and superstition of the past, and learned that it is not the business of the Church to dictate the policy of the State, nor of the State to say by whom, or by what means, men are to be saved in a kingdom not of this world.Š Western Herald,
