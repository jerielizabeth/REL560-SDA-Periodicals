WE have set permanently at the head of our columns that the AMERICAN SENTINEL is published in the interests of religious libertyŠChristian and Constitutional. It is published in the interests of Christian reli-gious liberty first of all, over all, in all, and through all, because that in the realm of the spirit of man, Jesus Christ is the Author of religious liberty and of nothing else. Jesus Christ created man. He created him with such a nature that his only happiness and his only good can be found in serving his Creator with all his heart, all his soul, all his might, all his mind, and all his strength. For such is "the first of all the commandments." Yet for all this, the Creator made man so perfectly free that it rests altogether in the man's own choice as to whether he will serve his Lord at all. It was so in the beginning, in the garden; it is so yet, and for evermore; because man in his creation is an element in "the eternal purpose which is purposed in Christ." Therefore the word in which are revealed the counsels of the Creator in this eternal purpose, that word which liveth and abideth forever, rings out to all, through all the ages, "Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve." " Whosoever will, let him come, and take of the water of life freely." "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him  not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." His word is "the word of life." It is the word of eter-nal lifeŠthe word of life of the eternal One. To whomso-ever that word comes, in this there comes to him eternal life. To reject that word is to reject eternal life. And to reject eternal life is to choose eternal death. He who rejects eternal life, in that very thing judges  himself worthy of eternal death. He who chooses eter-nal death, thus passes sentence of death upon himself. Therefore it was spoken to them of old, and is written to all, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you; but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life," etc. " See I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; . . . therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live." Thus it is that the Lord can say truly, "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not." That is the truth: and when in that Great Day, the unbeliev-ing meet eternal death, they receive only that which they have freely chosen. And though the Lord created man in the beginning for the highest of all possible destinies, and, when the man by wrong choice lost the way to it, gave Himself that the man might after all attain to it; yet He still leaves him absolutely free to accept or reject this destiny at his own choice. CHRISTIANITY AND ANTICHRISTIANITY. This is Christianity. This is the divinely-ordained freedom of mankind in religious things. We ask then, Why will not all professed Christians recognize it and act accordingly? They cannot deny that it is the principle of the word of God: why do they not stand unswervingly upon it? They cannot deny that it is the word and the example of the Lord Jesus: why then do they not in strictest integrity "walk as He walked"? It is perfectly plain that to swerve a hair's breadth from this principle is to forsake Christianity. For Chris-tians to act in any point or in any degree contrary to this word of Christ, is to act the part of antichrist. This is as plain as that two and two make four. And yet the professed Christians of almost all sorts are working in almost all ways, to get governmental power .in their hands by which they propose to compel men to observe the Christian Sabbath; to compel men to submit to the will of the Church; to compel men by hu-man laws to accept " the reign of Christ on Capitol Hill." Who does not know that this is so? And because all such work is antichristian, this is
