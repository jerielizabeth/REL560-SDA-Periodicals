If  LIBERTY!  "Proctaun liberty throughout all the land unto all the rnhibitants thereof." Lev. 25: 10. Vol,. X THIRD QUARTER, 1915 No. 3                 Breaking the Chains of Slavery C. M. SNOW THERE has never been any other such dreadful slaveryi as the slavery of the liquor traffic. The people of every land have felt the merciless grip of its shackles. It has respected neither age. sex, nor condition. It has dealt with the world more pitilessly than the fabled monster of ancient Crete, which devoured his annual tribute of seven youths and seven maidens exacted from Athens, un-til a Theseus arose and slew the bovine-human monster. That was the ancient Minotaur. But every nation in the world is today paying tribute to a modern Min-otaur, less discriminating but far more exacting than anything mentioned in ancient legends. Many of the brightest minds of every nation, state, and munici-pality have been blighted and destroyed by the exactions of that merciless Mino-taur that tramples and devours and de-stroys, but never heals nor benefits nor restores. The human race has been long tolerant of that death-breathing and ruin-wielding offspring of covetousness and appetite. Is there no Theseus in these days to slay the monster and free the world from its tribute of human beings? They are marching in unbroken lines by day and by night to their doom. thousands on thousands, a fearful ar-ray of idiots, imbeciles, lunatics, frat- ricides, parricides, homicides, tattered tramps, and worthless wrecks of— hu-manity. That is the tribute which this gen-eration of ours is paying to the Minotaur of drink. But it is not the whole tribute; for there is left behind another. army whose pitiful condition should excite the sympathy of a Moloch. It is an army in tattered garb, whose eyes are red with weeping, whose cheeks are sunken with want, and whose bodies are —wasted with fasting. There are widows with or-phaned children, crying for bread and shivering with the cold ; there are moth-ers and fathers with bowed heads and aching hearts, sorrowing over the ruin of their children; there are children shuddering in grief and terror over the loss of a mother slain by the hand of a drink-crazed father; there are de-fenseless households turned into the street when drink has sent the wage earner to prison, or robbed him of his ability to earn a living for his family. Who has the sight to license such an insatiate monster and turn him loose in the streets of our cities and villages to despoil the people and ruin our loved ones? Is there any price that can com-pensate us for what we lose? What can rum bring us as an eouivalent for what 101
