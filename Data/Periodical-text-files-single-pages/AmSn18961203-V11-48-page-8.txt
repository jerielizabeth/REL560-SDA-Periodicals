384 g VoL. 11, No. 48. NEW YORK, DECEMBER 3, 1896. Car.  ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE late W. C. T. U. convention at St.-Louis, Mo., passed a resolution protesting against Sunday traffic in the District of Columbia. IN our report of the meeting of the "New England Sabbath Rescue League," reference was made to Dr. Dewitt S. Clark as secretary of the league. This is a mistake. Dr. Clark was only temporarily in charge of the meet-ing, in the absence of the secretary, Dr. Mar-tin D. Kneeland. WE hereby express our appreciation of the hearty response given our call for coopera-tion in the circulation of the SENTINEL of November 26. It was an inspiring sight to see all hands busily engaged in sending out thousands of extra copies of this number. We still have a quantity of this valuable issue on hand, and will fill orders for it as long as the supply lasts; after which we will fill the orders with this present issue, which is an excellent companion number to the issue of November 26. 'Usual ratesŠone cent per copy. A GREAT stir is being made in California in behalf of a State Sunday law. One of the leaders in the movement writes, " We are flooding the State with petitions for a law, and this will be pressed upon the coming legislature as never before; at least so I hope. The work has to be done by a very few ear-nest men, mostly ministers:" Of course; that has been the regular method of " National Reform" work for years. A " flood of petitions," " whole State aroused," " overwhelming public sentiment" Šsuch are the usual features of a well-ordered Sunday-law campaign which frighten time-serving legislatures into enacting Sunday statutes; but which, when the noise and dust have passed away, are discovered to be only the efforts of "a very few earnest men, mostly ministers." THE western organ of the "Christian En-deavor" movement seems to be the Christian Endeavorer, published in Chicago. The November number is an "International Edi-tion." It calls loudly for. a "Rescue of the Sabbath." It wants literature on the Sab-bath question. It wants "some scholars to restudy the Sabbaths of the Bible, and write books and tracts upon the subject." It wants "some lecturers to unite the churches and laborers in a struggle for the Sabbath." It wants "a Sabbath tract society to secure men  who will write appropriate and much-needed tracts, and have them circulated by the mill-ions." It says that "every Christian family and individual should be reached." Good. We are interested in this ourselves. We therefore ask every reader of the AMER-WAN SENTINEL who has, or can obtain, good literature on the Sabbath question, to put it into circulation at once. We ask all who can write, to restudy the Sabbaths of the Bible and write appropriate and much-needed tracts, articles for papers, etc., and do all you can to have them published and circulated by the million. We ask whoever can speak, not to lecture, but to preach the truth of the Sab-bath as it is bound up with the everlasting gospel of the Son of God. Do all you can to unite all people in the struggle for the Sab-bath. Some of this Sabbath literature is needed in the office of the Christian Endeavorer it-self. That paper is not well informed yet as to what day the Sabbath really is. - It thinks that the first day of the week is the Sabbath, while the Bible says plainly, "The seventh day is the Sabbath." Some of our readers there-fore who may have good literature on the Sabbath question, or who can write .a good article on it, might send such to the Chris-tian Endeavorer, 185 Dearborn Street, Chi-cago, Ill. Yet do not stop with this; send such everywhere and to all people, till all in the land and in the wide world shall know the truth of the Sabbath of the Lord. THE Christian Work tells of steps taken by churches in Canada looking to the "estab-lishment of a 'federal court to be composed of representatives of the various churches;" and that they are "willing to empower it to give expression in cases of emergency to the opinion of the churches on moral and reli-gious questions affecting the welfare of the 'community, and to take action for the churches when such action is desirable." The Christian Work then remarks that "there is something in this plan worthy of the careful consideration of the denomina-tional bodies on this side of the Canadian line." Is it possible that there is not enough of this sort of thing being carried on already on this side of the line? No; it is plain that they will never be content till they possess such a "federal court" of churches, or else a federal court so ruled by the churches, that thus they shall be able to rule the country for "the welfare of the community." THE State' of Washington has recently taken her stand with the number of American commonwealths which protect the rights of their people from the invasions of Sunday laws. A resident of Tacoma was convicted in the municipal court of violating the " Sab-bath," and the case was appealed to the Su-preme Court, where the decision was re-versed. In its ruling the court said: " If the Sabbath law is valid, then the legislature would have the right to prohibit farm labor,  printing, and nine tenths of the employments which citizens usually engage in in this coun-try, and leave the other one tenth to pursui-their vocations. The ordinance in questiony deemed as special legislation; and while-,it47 true that there have been some decigoils, notably in New York, holding the co Crary view, this court is satisfied that the ordinance is unconstitutional, and reverses judgment, with instructions to dismiss the case." THE Christian Endeavorer, having fallen into the mistake of thinking that Sunday is the Sabbath, counts as enemies of the Sab-bath those who believe the Bible that "the seventh day is the Sabbath," and who at-tempt to get others to believe it also. Of the Seventh-day Adventists, on this score it says :Š The enemy is thoroughly organized; showers of tracts, books and papers are being circulated to mis-lead the Christian public. At the International Con-vention at Washington, recently, they boast of having put into the hands of "nearly 60,000 Christian young people, nearly 240,000 pages of tracts." One seventh of one per cent. of the professedly "Christian" population of this country, publish and circulate twenty fold more tracts, books and papers against our sabbath, than ninety-nine and six-sevenths per cent. of the Christian population does in its de-fense. Take a half dozen of their recent publications, with a circulatiovf from 25,000 to 1,000,000 copies each, and possibly read by three persons to each tract. Yet none of these tracts have been followed with a refu-tation. In one State these people sell about $12 worth of literature to each member they have in the State, and 90 per cent. of their literature attacks the Sabbath and the churches. If the churches would circulate 25 cents' worth of the right kind of literature to each member of the churches our country could soon be redeemed from this curse. Good I. Let every man, woman, and child, who ever read or heard that "the seventh day is the Sabbath," tell it to every possible per:- son. And let all such know that whether they be counted enemies or not, they are making known the truth of God. "I HAVE arrived at the profound conviction that nothing has more hastened the.  loss of liberty than the errors of our fathers con-cerning the manner of organizing religion." ŠDe Pressense.
