Subscription. price, $1.00 The state cannot undertake to "protect" religion without denying the rights of that portion of its cit-izens which are opposed to the religion favored by the government. THE very fact that an individual wants to force other people to conform to his standard of righteous-ness is conclusive proof that his standard is not the right one.      BECAUSE each religion is necessarily intolerant of every other religion in the land, it follows that the state cannot be religious without giving effect to re-ligious intolerance by civil pains and penalties. L. A.. SMITH, ll  0. P. EOLLMAINI,i   Editors. GOD is the only master of conscience.

Matt. 5 :II, 12. And again: "This is acceptable, if for conscience toward God, a man endure griefs, suffering wrongful-ly. For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffet-ed for it, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God." I Peter 2 : I9, 20, R. V. Conscience is defined by the Standard Dictionary as "the power or faculty in man by which he distin-
