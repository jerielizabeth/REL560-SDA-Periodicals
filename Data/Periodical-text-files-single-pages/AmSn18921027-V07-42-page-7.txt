Once let the question as to Christianity come before Congress; and who does not see that there is definite danger that a majority of senators and representatives will vote that Christianity is the law of the land, that this is a Christian Nation, and that we are bound to support by law Christian principles and to forbid unchristian practices ? "If, through inadvertence, we have slipped away from our well-defended post, let us make haste to renew our vigilance, There can be no doubt that every advocate of 'Christianity in the Constitution' has taken courage at his success in vindicating the honor of the 'Christian Sabbath' by voting a re-striction on the loan granted to the Columbian Ex-position. There can be no doubt that the next step will be taken with greater confidence and more hope of success. It is equally certain that, to make our influence felt, we must not merely support the legislation that we like, and oppose that which is not of our way thinking, but we must resist all legislation which has the slightest tendency to limit religious liberty in belief, spirit, and practice, Let us remember that it was Anne Hutchinson's fruit-ful maxim, 'No man a delinquent on account of creed,' which put the spirit and letter of religious liberty into the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the Commonwealth." THE Baptist ministers of the city of Chicago, in their Conference held Monday, October 3, passed resolutions endorsing the action of Congress in re-gard to requiring the gates of the Exposition to be closed on Sunday, and protesting against the repeal of the same by that body, when it shall again as-semble. Mayor Washburne and other prominent citizens, were severely censured for their opposi-tion to the Sunday closing act. It was noticeable that the Conference was not a unit, although the vote was declared to be unanimous. Some left be-fore the vote was reached, and many that were present did not vote on either side. There were about sixty ministers at the Confer-ence. This is the first action this Conference has taken in favor of Sunday legislation. About one year ago, the same body had a similar matter under consideration, which provoked an animated discus-sion, in the course of which a prominent minister solemnly arose, shaking his arms, saying, " I im-agine I can again hear the chains rattling on the arms of conscientious Baptist ministers." These ministers are the representatives of the church that in the days of Cotton Mather, declared that it was not within the realm of the State to enforce obedience to any one of the first four com-mands of the Decalogue, for the reason that they alone related to man's duty to his God. CONGRESSMAN HEMPHILL is Mayor of Atlanta; he is also Chairman of the House Committee on the District of Columbia, which, during the last session of Congress, reported favorably to the House the bill to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday in the District of Columbia, as well as the provision punishing profanity in the Dis-trict. It seems that as Mayor of Atlanta Mr. Hemp-hill is keeping up the record made in Congress on this question. Not long ago the Atlanta City Council passed an ordinance allowing the Atlanta Parcel and Express Company to deliver ice cream and such commodities on Sunday. This measure Mayor Hemphill promptly vetoed. There was a ground upon which this measure should have been vetoed ; it was not upon this ground, however, that Mr. Hemphill's veto was based. The Atlanta City Council has no right to say that the parcel delivery shall or shall not serve its customers on Sunday, any more than on any other day. If the veto had stated this and called for the repeal of other existing similar ordinances it would have taken the proper position ; not other-wise. THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS BY JOHN BUNYAN.
