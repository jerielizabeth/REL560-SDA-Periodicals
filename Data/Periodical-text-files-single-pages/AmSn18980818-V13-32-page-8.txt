508 AMERICAN SENTINEL. PASSING events continue to make it more clear that the question of the disposition of the Philippines is not one that will be lightly settled. Now that American and Spanish troops have met in battle at Manila, and Amer-ican blood has been shed and American lives lost in es-tablishingAmerican supremacy, the sentiment for retain-ing the islands as American territory is no doubt tre-mendously strengthened, and in all probability will be too strong to be denied. And when this Government announces definitely its intention to establish itself in power on the borders of the seat of the contentions of the Old World powers, it will not be strange if those powers take more decisive action in the matter than they have done hitherto. * * THE Scripture says that man at his best estate is al-together vanity, and man himself is continually demon-strating the truth of the statement. One way in which he does this is by presuming to exercise powers which are altogether beyond his capacity to possess. For in-stance, men are continually claiming the ability to ap-prehend, to a greater or less degree, events which are yet behind the veil of the future. There is the weather prophet, who predicts what the weather will be for a month or more in advance. There are also the astrolo-gers, and fortune tellers, who claim the ability to foretell the chief events of an individual's life, and who are cred-ited by most people with having some degree of power in this direction. And aside from all these, the vast major-ity of people have more or less confidence in their own ability to predict what is going to happen, when they have some slight basis of known facts from which to shape their conclusions. They are always ready when opportunity offers to speak the self-justifying words, "I told you so." * * THE events of the war with Spain, which are fresh in the minds of all, afford an illustration upon this point. Before the war began, but when it had become a visible prospect, a certain writer drew considerable attention to himself by writing a history of "our late war with Spain." Few people believed at that time that war would come, but with the possibility of it in mind, the probable result of a clash between two powers provided with modern im-plements of war was a question of general interest. The writer set forth such events as, to his mind, were to be expected in the conflict. From what was known of the  resources of the two nations, and of the nature of the weapons that would be brought into use, he thought to make a fairly accurate prediction of what would happen when these two nations pitted their armies and navies against each other. And his descriptions were received by thepublic with almost the interest that would begiven to credible prophecy. * * * BUT his predictions could hardly 'have fallen more wide of the truth. The great battle between the Spanish and American fleets, as he portrayed it, was a doubtful contest, in which the opposing ships were obscured by clouds of smoke, under cover of which one of the fast auxiliary cruisers sailed close to one of the Spanish bat-tleships and silenced it completely by a single broadside from more than a hundred small quick-firing guns; and at the close of the combat not one of the victorious American ships was in condition to continue the fight. As a matter of fact, when the opposing fleets came to-gether off Santiago, the auxiliary cruisers played no part at all in the contest, the result was never doubtful, and the American fleet was not at all disabled by the fire of the enemy. So far from proving, as predicted by a num-ber of assumed authorities, only an even match for the Spanish navy, the American fleets have sent the Spanish fleets to the bottom of the sea without suffering the loss or serious injury of a single ship. IT is a strange thing, but yet true, that men have always been inclined to pay more attention to the pre-dictions of their finite fellow mortals than to those of the Word of God. And though the predictions of inspira-tion have never yet failed, while those from a human source have scarcely been anything but failures, people are to-day as ready as ever to allow their minds to be diverted from the truth by things that are false and of no value. It is the purpose of the author of what is false and counterfeit, to obscure what is genuine and true; and the world to day is flooded with counterfeits of the things provided by the grace of Omnipotence for man's salvation. But "nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure," having this infallible test: "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." * * * THE war with Spain having practically ended, it may be presumed that Spain's "honor" is satisfied; for this "honor" was the one thing that Spain most strenuously insisted on preserving. But what real honor has Spain preserved? From whom does Spain now receive honor as the outcome of her conduct of the war? Evidently her fancied preservation.of honor is but a gigantic hallu-cination. Only feelings of pity and contempt have been awakened throughout the civilized world by the display of weakness and barbarity which marked the struggle on the Spanish side.
