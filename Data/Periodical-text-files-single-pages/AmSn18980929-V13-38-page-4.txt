600 AMERICAN SENTINEL. self out of all duties of citizenship. Suppose you have half a dozen poor relatives, and out of love for them you provide an institution for their support out of your own pocket, instead of sending them to one of your asylums. Will you therefore ask that you should not pay a poor rate, or be taxed for the maintenance of the state's poor? Again, you want your letters to go without risk, and so you send them by hand. Do you object to pay taxes for the Post Office Department?" This is a fair presentation of the case, and makes plain that to apply the full amount raised by taxation to the unsectarian schools, is entirely fair to all religious bodies. The Surrender of Conscience. A PROMINENT figure in the proceedings relating to the Dreyfus case, Count Esterhazy, has, it is said, made confession to several persons that he is guilty of having manufactured much of the evidence by which Dreyfus was convicted of treason and sent to his terrible punish-ment. The Sun, of this city, in making note of the in-famy of such a character, says:Š " Esterhazy's justification for all that he has done in the Dreyfus case is interesting to moralists. It is em-braced in his maxim: `A soldier should place his con-science as well as his sword at the disposal of his superior officers.'" This French army officer placed his conscience at the disposal of his superior officers, and under their orders, according to his confession, forged evidence upon which was based the military verdict which is now shaking the fabric of the French government to its foundations. He placed his conscience at the disposal of his superior officers for the honor of France, and the deed is now testifying to her shame. He did all this especially to guard the reputation of the army, and by it brought a cloud of popular distrust upon the army. In it he has done incalculable injury to France, and has illustrated the nature of the benefits that man is prepared to confer on his country who is willing to part with his conscience. Nothing could better illustrate the fact that the man who surrenders his conscience becomes thereby one of the most dangerous men by which the welfare of a coun-try can be threatened. This is one lesson of the Dreyfus case which should not be lost upon liberty-loving people. However interesting the plea that an individual ought sometimes to part with his conscience may be to moralists, it is not interesting as a curiosity. It is a plea that is not confined to France or Frenchmen. It is made in every country that commits the folly of religious legislation. It is made in these United States, where the Sunday laws are carried into effect. Such laws compel the surrender of conscience to the State, upon the point of Sabbath observance. They are made and enforced in the interests of the State, so it is said, and they force conscience to be delivered into the keeping of the State; and now the example of Count Esterhazy comes forward  to illustrate before the world how much to the advantage of a country this surrender of the individual conscience is. And it is just as valuable a thing in one countryŁas Ł in another. The man who will surrender his conscience upon one point, will surrender it upon any point. He cannot logically do otherwise. The man who will surrender his conscience upon the point of Sabbath observance, will surrender it upon the point of bearing false witness against his neighbor, as Esterhazy did, or upon the point of theft, or of murder, as surely as theft, murder, and Sabbath-breaking are matters of the same moral law. Count Esterhazy's maxim constitutes an indictment of militarism which ought to condemn it utterly in the minds of thinking people. That maxim is no more than militarism dpmands. That is the principle by which it has been found necessary to guard the "honor" of the army in France, and the same principle is brought into exercise in all lands where militarism has become an established feature of the government. The honor of the army is put above everything else. The army gets to be the biggest thing in the nation, because it is the most powerful; and the rules of army discipline and military government overshadow the laws of the gov-ernment instituted to preserve the rights of the people. Army government is a despotism pure and simple; by no other system could an army be held together and made efficient for military work. And that despotism requires that the individual soldier yield his own will implicitly to that of his military superiors, who of course are only men like himself. And from this surrender of the individual will, which army discipline everywhere requires, the step to the,surrender of conscience is natural if not inevitable. The will and the conscience cannot be separated from each other. There can be no safety for human rights where a man is taught to surrender his conscience into the keep-ing of same other man in superior civil or military sta-tion. This is the evil principle that has made jesuitism what it has been and is to-day. It is the essence of jesu-itism,Šthat from which nearly every civilized country in the world has felt obliged to defend itself by the most stringent measures. Every law therefore which tends to compel the conscience, is not only an invasion of indi-vidual rights, but a direct menace to the national pros-perity. - Individual rights and individual honor lie at the foundation of everything. The invasion or surrender of these can no more be for the advantage of the State than can the disintegration of the foundation be for the ad-vantage of the structure reared upon it.
