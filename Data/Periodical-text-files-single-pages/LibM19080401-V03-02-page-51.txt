The Individual Conscience ViiksiteetZ'' .1";:41-4174' ntitzu- HE majority must rule! Shall the majority rule in matters of conscience? Can you count consciences? Can you count moral principles? Can you count the impulses of the heart, the faculties of the soul, the multitudinous cords that bind the individual to the universal heart? If you can, you may count majorities in cases of conscience. . . . Can you speak of ballots and ballot-boxes, of the ayes and noes of the legislative hall, against this right of individual conscience ? It stands too high for legislative power to reach up to it.Å  Extract from the speech of C. C. Burleigh, Esq., of Philadelphia, in the Religious Liberty Convention in Boston, March 23, 24, 1848.
