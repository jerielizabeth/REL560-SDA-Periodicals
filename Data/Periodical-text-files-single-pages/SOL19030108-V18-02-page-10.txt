The Supremacy of the Papacy 'By Alonzo T. Jones VI THE PAPACYŠTHE VERY SAME PAPACY THAT THE WORLD KNEW IN THE TENTH CENTURYŠIS TO-DAY AIMING TO SECURE TO HERSELF A RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SHE HAD THIS ONCE. THE ARTICLES THAT ARE APPEARING UNDER THE ABOVE HEADING ARE A STUDY OF HOW SHE USED IT. SINCE IT IS HER OWN BOAST THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES," TO KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH SUCH SUPREMACY WHEN SHE HAD IT IS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH IT WHEN SHE SECURES IT AGAIN. S soon as the death of Clement was known in Paris, the university ad- dressed the king, begging him to prohibit the cardinals at Avignon from electing another pope. The king sent a message to this effect to the cardinals at Avignon. The king of Aragon also ad-dressed them to the same purpose. The archbishops of Treves, Mayence; and Co-logne made the same request. And Pope Boniface, of course, did the same. But the cardinals had taken precaution, and forestalled all these things. Being in solemn conclave, they refused to receive any communications of any kind what-ever until their deliberations might be ended. They agreed, however, amongst themselves, and took a solemn oath, that "whoever was chosen should at once re-sign the papacy at the request of the car-dinals, provided Boniface also would re-sign." The conclave chose the carditial of Luna, who had repeatedly lamented the schism, and had openly declared that if he were pope he would put an end to it at once. And when he sent to the king of France the notice of his election, he in-formed the king that it was only the im-portunity of the cardinals that had com-pelled him to accept the unwelcome of-fice of pope ; but that he was fully pre-pared to do whatever was advisable to bring peace to the Church. The Uni- versity of Paris received this word with joy, and sent to him an address, in which they recognized him as pope, and highly commended his noble sentiments. To this he replied anew, suiting his action to the word : "I am as ready to resign the office as to take off this cap." Before the death of Clement VII., Boniface IX. had made proclamation to the world that he was anxious to end the schism. But each pope was willing to end the schism only by having the other one resign. The two popes were now : Benedict XIII., at Avignon, (Sept. 28, 1394, to Nov. 29, 1424), and Boniface IX., at Rome, (Nov. 2, 1389, to Oct. I, 1404). THE FRUITLESS EFFORT OF RULERS TO RESTORE ORDER TO THE PAPACY The miseries of this papal anarchy had now become so great that the king of France took the lead in having the great powers of Christendom unite to save the Papacy from itself. He sent representa-tives to Germany and to England to further this purpose. The University of Paris entered a standing appeal from all the acts of Benedict XIII. to a future one who should be true and universal pope. Benedict issued a but: ;.!enouncing this as defamatory libel. A national assembly of the State and Church of France met in Paris, approved the king's plan, and sent ambassadors to Benedict beseeching him Ł
