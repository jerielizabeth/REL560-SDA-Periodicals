678 AMERICAN SENTINEL. came in his own merits. The offering of Abel was an act of faith. The offering of Cain was that of legalism,Šde-pending upon his works. His was a legal religion, and he appealed to the gospel of force. And appealing to the gospel of force, he folio wed it to its ultimatum,Šthe murder of the man of faith. Thus faith and force have always been at opposites. It was always so, and always will be so. Those who have faith are content with the gospel of persuasion. Those who have not faith always appeal to the gospel of force. And appealing to force they always follow it to its ultimatum. And those who now appeal to force will form no exception, but will follow on to the point of imposing the death penalty upon dissenters. Murder is in the gospel of force. Rome and the United States in Concert. THE following paragraphs from an instructive arti-cle on "Religious Liberty in'the Philippines," which the Rev. N. H. Harriman, president of a Protestant mis-sionary society, contributes to The Independent, show how Rome and the Government are acting in concert for the restoration of Catholic supremacy in the isl-ands:Š "Protestants should begin at once, in earnest, and our military authorities should enforce the principle of religious equality, not hinder it. The military governor has it in his power to place insuperable obstacles in the way of missionaries. This has of late been done, under the pretext of military expediency. Even President Schurinann, of the Civil Commission, was hoodwinked into asserting that missionaries were hampering the military authorities; this was a sly move to keep mis-sionaries out until Otis and the Archbishop have pre-empted the ground and got matters arranged. If any doubt the charity of this remark, let him read to the end." "When Spanish priests, with the cunning Archbishop at their head, made complaints that missionaries were doing wrong by distributing Testaments and tracts to the natives, a real American, true to national tradi-tions and unbiased by his religion, would have told them to go about their business and would have read them a lecture upon religious liberty and the rights of American citizens in the Philippines. Instead of that, the governor-general sent for the Rev. B. C. Randall, agent for the British and Foreign Bible Society, and weakly advised him not to sell any more Protestant lit-erature at present. In Cebu, the military governor sent for the writer, and peremptorily ordered him not to sell any more tracts and Testaments, and was made to con-fess that his reason for this extraordinary order was that the Spanish priests were 'complaining,' and the Spanish local paper was criticising. These instances will sufficiently illustrate the point that the military difficulty is no myth." "During the first months after the occupation, the Spanish clergy were becomingly modest; indeed, their power was effectually broken. Many left the islands, as  did also the friars and nuns, and the rest gave evidence that they regarded themselves as dispossessed of further power. When our missionaries arrived on the field, the natives were open to free approach, and hungry to hear. Agent Randall found it a most hopeful field. In a few weeks he sold not less than ten thousand copies of his literature, and with others disposed of a full edition of the work translated by the converted priest of whom mention has been made, who ten years ago was poi-soned in the Hotel de l'Orient; this was a treatise on the Gospel, the instrument of his conversion, and he translated it into Pagasinan, spoken in Northern Lu-zon. This was the situation in March, and on into April." "In April the reaction set in, while the writer was there. The priests, under the mistaken diplomacy of the governor, began to take heart. Scurrilous pamph-lets ware circulated among the natives, having for their object not only to poison their minds against mission-aries, but against all Americans. Some of these were vile slanders against American womanhood, with other things of similar character. Presently the Spanish priests were known to be 'laboring with' those.  of their people who were in the habit of visiting the mission home, and others whom our missionaries had talked with. Then a more openly hostile attitude was as-sumed, as General Otis encouraged the priests and made a friend of the Archbishop. Then it was that an official prohibition was put upon the sale of all Protest-ant tracts and Testaments." "As further illustration of the effects of politics, priestcraft and incompetent and biased militarism, note the following straws: Catholic chaplains are be-ing sent to the islands in disproportionate numbers, some leaving the posts to which they are assigned in this country, 'post chaplains,' and spending their time largely in Manila. Is this 'military diplomacy?' " "Father McKinnon, the chaplain of the First Cali-fornia Regiment, was early appointed 'Superintendent of Schools and Cemeteries' in Manila. Under him the school system is being revised, English is being taught, Catholic teachers are being brought from this country, and the priests come into the schools and bless the chil-dren, laying their hands on their heads. Does 'military diplomacy' demand that the school system of the islands be Catholic? Is this the way that future Ameri-can citizens are to be made? After Father McKinnon's appointment Father McQuade was sent out; but he spent more time in Manila than with his regiment. Why do they flock to Manila?" "It is time for the Government at Washington to investigate a common rumor, that seemed to be well known, to this effect: The newspaper organ of the Archbishop became so openly abusive of all that was American, that its editor, who, of course, was the visi-ble proprietor, was arrested and court-martialed. His sentence was seven years in Bilibid Prison, a fine of $5.000, and confiscation of his whole plant. Otis re-viewed the court martial and fined him $250, and remit-ted all the rest, saying: 'This will be sufficient lesson for him.' The 'lesson' to the offending prelate must have been that he could henceforth do about :as he liked." "There is in Manila, in official circles, a well-defined rumor, amounting to almost a confident assertion,that
