Ontario's "Lord's Day" Legislation Invalid PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, AUGUST 6, 1903 NO. 32 I believe legislation to enforce Sunday observance is not only detrimental to the best interests of society;  but is an improper and unwarranted interference with the great Protestant right of private judgment in all matters pertaining to religion. . . . The proper functions of the state do not include the ascertainment and declaration of theological truth and its enforcement upon the people. Religion is a matter for the individual conscience,ŠHon. John S. Swart, K. C.., Winnipeg, Manitoba, October 26, 1902. Everybody should enjoy complete liberty, provided that liberty does not interfere with the liberty and civil rights or others. To force people to observe Sunday is not protec-tion of civil rights; it is interference with civil rights in obedience to religious sentiment. By this ["Lord's Day''] bill we claim jurisdiction in religious matters. I belie'be it is not our duty here to occupy ourselves with religion. Each individual has the right to worship God as he thinks proper, provided he does not interfere <with the liberty of anyone else.ŠHon. G. Amyott, M.
