President Wilson Denounces Mob Violence OUR President is a real Ameri-can and a true champion of democ-racy. He is fearless in denouncing a wrong principle, and coura-geous in upholding jus-tice. His ideals are practical, and his example is worthy of emulation. We trust that his forceful arraignment and denunciation of lynch law and mob vio-lence, which have so often tarnished the fair records of American history, will have the effect of shaming the perpetra-tors so they will desist from their anar-chistic and lawless operations. Such conduct in disregard of lawful authority would be a disgrace to even the most degraded of nations. Lynching is mur-der, and cannot be too strongly con-demned. Every periodical in America should raise its voice in protest against this barbarous practice. We take pleasure in reproducing Pres-ident Wilson's timely admonition, as fol-lows : "MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I take the liberty of addressing you upon a subject which so vitally affects the honor of the nation and the very character and integrity of our institutions that I trust you will think me justified in speak-ing very plainly about it- " I allude to the mob spirit which has recently here and there very fre-quently shown its head amongst us, not in any sin-gle region, but in many and widely separated parts of the country. There have been many lynchings, and every one of them has been a blow at the heart of ordered law and humane justice. No man who loves America, no man who really cares for her fame and honor and character, or who is truly loyal to her institu-tions, can justify mob action while the courts of justice are open and the governments of the States and the nation are ready and able to do their duty. We are at this very moment fight-ing lawless passion. Germany has outlawed herself among the nations because she has dis-regarded the sacred obligations of law and has made lynchers of her armies. Lynchers emulate her disgraceful example. I, for my part, am anxious to see every community in America rise above that level with pride and a fixed resolution which no man or set of men can afford to despise. " We proudly claim to be the champions of democracy. If we really are, in deed and in truth, let us see to it that we do not discredit our own. I say plainly that every American who takes part in the action of a mob or gives it any sort of countenance is no true son of this great democracy, but its betrayer, and does more to discredit her by that single disloyalty to her standards of law and of right than the words of her statesmen or the sacrifices of her heroic boys in the trenches can do to make suffering peoples believe her to be their astvinT 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111m1111101111111111111HIHINHINIIIIIIIRIN No Man is a Champion of Liberty or Democracy Who Does Not Reverence Our Own Laws IIIIIIII11111111111111111111111111111M1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
