150 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY days of rest than the religious systems of the latter require them to keep, and thus to protect all in the equal right to religious freedom and to restrain the stronger from such acts of " spiritual op-pression and intolerance." But a constant routine of hard or un-varied toil, either of body or mind, be-comes irksome, tedious and unpleasant, and tends in a degree to dull the mind, or make it weary and unhappy, and per-haps impairs its vigor. An occasional relaxation, therefore, of toil, or a change of employment from servile labor to that which is made lighter and more agree-able for being voluntary and mixed with mirth or partaking of the character of festivity, and amounting to nothing more than innocent recreation or amusement, is useful and necessary to the preserva-tion of health and the increase of the sum of human happiness, and is in strict accordance with the dictates of human nature in the respect of work and rest. When, therefore, governments are de-fining and protecting the rights of serv-ants and other dependents, and limiting the authority of the employer to the bounds of reason, humanity and justice, they have a right to appoint a time when the employer shall allow his dependents to suspend their labors and partake, if they please, of innocent recreation. They have a right also, and are in duty bound, to restrain any religious sect from inter-fering on religious pretenses [grounds] to prevent those innocent enjoyments which nature kindly tolerates or pre-scribes and which coincide with moral rectitude and the benevolent principles of rational liberty. Government Has no Right to Interdict Useful Industry or Harmless Recreation Such are the objects and such the out-ward boundary line of legislative right and duty to interpose a law prescribing a time for labor, rest, or recreation. To  such extent and no farther the legislature has a right and is in duty bound to go ; because, as has been before remarked, it is the chief end and object of civil government to restrain its constituents from doing wrong or injury to each other, and to protect all alike in the enjoyment of their natural and inalienable right to exercise the virtue of useful industry, and to rest and take innocent recreation when nature or their comfort or their pleasure may require it; and also in the enjoyment of the right to the liberty of conscience (religious freedom) which is among the most important. But laws of the description and for the object last mentioned would be, from their very nature and occasion, obligatory only on those whose aggressive conduct they would be intended to restrain, leaving all others to do useful labor or take their rest or innocent recreation, should they choose, or their necessities, their con-venience, their pleasure, or their religious tenets require it. But what would we think should we see an employer undertake to command, coerce, or scourge his servant or depend-ent to oblige him against his will to quit his work and to take his rest or recrea-tion, when he wanted none ? Just what we have a right to think of a legislative act which is no less absurd and unjust when it undertakes by pains and penalties to force those to rest whose toil has not fatigued them, or who, having enjoyed their natural and nightly rest, would pre-fel' to exercise their honest and virtuous industry to increase the comforts of their lives and those of their dependent off-spring. Could those who chose to rest a day, either for pleasure or to perform their religious worship, justly complain of being injured by the honest industry of others who choose to perform it in a manner not to disturb those actually en-gaged in their religious devotions ? Idle-ness is a crime, or so certainly leads to it
