SOCIAL PURITY Published by The Teachers' Publishing Company, Des Moines, Iowa. A monthly magazine for teach-. ers and pupils that proposes to supplement other school journals rather than to occupy the same field. It will seek to provide an OUTLOOK upon af-fairs-of life and facts in science and nature which illustrate and test theories; to stimulate thought, and give the teacher's mind a fresh source of in-spiration. A review of current events, civil and industrial problems, inventors, discoveries, etc., will be an im-portant feature of the magazine, and a complete review of current literature will also be given by competent critics. Another, and very important, feature of the mag-azine will be that all teachers and students are in-vited to join its circle of writers, out of which it proposes to draw its corps of future contributors. On Oda point it has some original plans of mut-ual helpfulness to carry out; aid to give writers in introducing them to the public, and suggestions to those who need practice and training in the ex-, pression of thought that will be helpful. Send 10 cents for magazine eight months. Agents wanted.
