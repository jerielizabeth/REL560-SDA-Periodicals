It is a val-uable book. though not entirely free from remarks which indi-cate wrong ideas. But as these occur only incidentally, and are in no sense essential to the author's course of reasoning, they are unimportant. The book can be safely put into the hands of any one, and would be especially valuable in dealing with the candid skeptic. Nearly 200 pages, Bound in Cloth.

Your Health Foods " are the wonder of the nineteenth century. I have used Granola but a short time, but have already experienced relief from indigestion and acid, or flatulent dyspepsia,. I also find the Zwiebach nourishing and toothsome. D. M. KAUFFMAN. I have personally tested your excellent food known as Granola. It is highly pleasing to the taste, easy of digestion, and the most nutritive cereal production with which I am acquainted. DR. R. W. BuLA. NEW YORK.

And who has not found that of all others, they love most those obtained from the Bible ? " Yes," you say, "we have been searching this long time, but books for children all have so many objections." Then you have not found the companion books, "Bible Pictures and Stories," and ' Little Folks Bible Gallery," written by Jennie B. Merrill.
