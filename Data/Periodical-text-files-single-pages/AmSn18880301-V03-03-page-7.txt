THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 23 principles just now? Are we threatened with alien interference and with a foreign power to influence and overawe our elections? I leave it to your own burning sense of recent events  to frame the proper reply. The pro-posal to introduce a Papal nuncio into the Republic; the residence among us of a cardi-nal,, who is a foreign prince, and bound to a foreign court by obligations which no Ameri-,can has any right to assume; the goings to and fro of ecclesiastics to consult an alien po-tentate as to our domestic questions of labor and labor associations, and to prescribe to our citizens what they may do or not do in ',such issues; and the proposed establishment, in this capital, of a university under the au-thority of a pontiff who, whatever the virtues of his private character, has been forced to re-invest the Jesuits with unlimited powers, and with functions against which every Ro-man Catholic Government in Europe has pro-tested, not only in words, but by banishing the Jesuits as public enemies and confiscat-ing their estates; ,I ask, Are not these tokens of peril to be resisted here and now and for all tune to .come? Are they not the prelude to an open-assault upon our common schools, and their subversion through political subserv- iency? Ł Ł "Archbishop Lynch, of Toronto, in a letter to Lord Randolph Churchill, reminds him that'he and his confraternity hold the balance of power in Canada, and through it have con-, trolled the elections there; and he goes on to assert that by a similar use of the balance of power, presidential elections will be decided in this Republic. "In California, certain ultramontane digni-taries have insulted American social ties of the most sacred character, by reflecting on the .marriages of the vast majority of our country-men as mere concubinage. " Our school system is denounced in terms the most flagrant, and a counter-system is set up in which the un-American ideas of the Syllabus are to be imposed on thousands of our future voters. I hold in my hand a book issued by the Catholic Publication Society' in New York, and by affiliated publishers in Baltimore and Cincinnati. It is printed in Baltimore, under license of its late Arch-bishop (Bailey) and the certificate of his of-ficial censor, that it is unobjectionable---` nihil obstat.' It is a book of instruction for chil-dren. Its motto is (quoted from Benedict We 'affirm that the greatest part of the damned are in hell, because they did not know those mysteries of faith which Chris-tians must  know and believe.' What are these mysteries? Let us read this authorized ultramontane school-book. "I quote (pp. 97-104) as follows:- "'Question. Have Protestants any faith  in Christ ? "'Answer. They never had. "'Q. Why not? "`A. Because there never lived such a Christ as they imagine and believe in. "'Q. In what kind of a Christ do they be- lieve? In such an one of whom they can make a liar, with impunity, whose doctrine  they can interpret as they please, and who does not care what a man believes, provided he be an honest man before the public. "`Q. Will such a faith in such a Christ save Protestants'? "'A. No sensible man will assert such an absurdity. "`Q. What will Christ say to them on the day of Judgment? "'A. I know you not, because you never knew MC. "`Q. Are Protestants willing to confess their sins to a Catholic bishop or priest, who alone has power from Christ to forgive sins? " Whose sins you shall forgive they are forgiven them." "'A. No; for they generally have an utter aversion to confession, and therefore their sins will not be forgiven them throughout all eter-nity. "'Q. What follows from this? "'A. That they die in their sins and are damned." And these are the people with whom the National Reform Association "will gladly join hands," as soon as the Catholics will consent. And these are the ones into whose hands the National Reformers will willingly put the public schools whenever the Catholics are in the majority. The wicked scheme ! WE belieVe that moral reforms must be wrought by moral agencies. Christians must do Christian work, by Christian methods, and in the spirit of Christ. Men are to be saved not by wholesale but one at a time. The gos-pel must be preached to every creature; it is the personal message of a personal salvation. All this we firmly hold, and have no disposi-tion to substitute other agencies or methods. But can it be wondered at that Christian zeal and endeavor are paralyzed in view of the fact that the whisky saloon, the fountain and for-tress of vice, is intrenched behind the law, and that the statutes against the social evil are a dead letter? The law of the land itself be-comes the minister of evil, and the officer of the law the protector rather than the terror of evil-doers. The Christianity that thus crys-tallizes itself into heathen practices cannot be wholly genuine; it is a sham Christianity in so far as it supports or compromises with these evils.-Nashville Christian Advocate. moDEHN SPIRITUALISM 1213 NATURE AND TENDENCY. BY ELD. J. IL WAGGONER. THIS is a thorough exposd of the system of Spiritualism. The author has carefully studied the subject, and has given such copious extracts from a large library of Spiritualist publica-tions, as to fully condemn them in their teachings and in their practices, by their own testimony. It is also shown from the prophetic scriptures that Spiritual-ism is one of the most impressive signs of the times. 184 pp. Price, 20 cents. Address, PACIFIC PRESS, Oakland, Cal.
