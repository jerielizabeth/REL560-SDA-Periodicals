SIBERIA AND THE NIHILISTS WHY KENNAN WENT TO SIBERIA, By William Jackson Armstrong, (Late Inspector General of United States Consulates.) This is one of the most intensely interesting and thoroughly reliable con-tributions to literature on Russia and the Nihilists ever published. It comprises Mr. Armstrong's famous lecture on "Siberia and the Nihilists" (delivered first in Cooper Union, New York, and afterwards by special request of many eminent men in Lincoln Hall, Washington), together with some exceedingly interesting letters and newspaper criticisms from the pens of the author and George Kennan, the Siberian traveller. EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, because no one can be intelligent upon the subject of which it treats without familiarity with its contents. Besides, the book is a powerful stimulus to that love of liberty so essential to the maintenance of free Government. It contains some pointed and caustic criticisms upon Mr. Kennan's defense of the Russian Government after his first visit to that country, and explains WHY KENNAN WENT TO SIBERIA the second time. The Century articles which were the result of that visit fully justify the position taken, and the statements made by Mr. Armstrong in 1883. 160 PAGES, PAPER COVERS, PRICE 25 cents.
