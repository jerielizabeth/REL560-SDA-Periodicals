AMERICAN SENTINEL. 163 foolish statement that there is no divine authority for the observance of Sunday as the Christian sabbath; or the other equally untrue saying: "It makes no difference what day of the week we observe as Sabbath, so that we observe one." Followers of Christ should observe only the first day of the week, the Lord's day, the Christian sabbath.* This is a home thrust at the Golden Rule, Dr. Clark's paper, and hitherto the representative paper of Christian Edeavor, which lately declared that the specific day of the Sabbath was of no more importance to Sabbath-keeping than the clothes a preacher wears are to the. ser-mon he preaches. Has it come to this, that Christian Endeavor leaders are so soon divided as to how Sunday shall be saved? These papers have come 'to such antag-onism by inventing different ways of escaping, or trying to escape, from the claims of the Sabbath. God's law is a troublesome thing when men want to invade it; and the greatest of blessings when men are obedient to it." Enforcing the Decalogue in Kansas. THE following is the bill introduced in the legislature of Kansas, by Representative Walters, calling for the legal enforcement of the Decalogue, as mentioned in our last issue:Š " An Act to give statutory force to the Ten Com-mandments : " WHEREAS, The men of the present generation have become dOubters and scoffers; and, " WHEREAS, They have strayed from the religion of their fathers; and, "WHEREAS, They no longer live in the fear of God; and, " WHEREAS, Having no fear of punishment beyond the grave, they wantonly violate the law given to the world from Mount Sinai; therefore, " Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:Š "SECTION 1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. " SECTION 2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image," etc. [Each one of the commandments constitutes a separate section of the Act.] "SEcTioN 11. Any man who shall violate any of the provisions of this Act shall be punished as fol-lows:Š " For violating Section 1, $1,000 fine; for violating Section 2, $1,000 fine and one year in the penitentiary; for violating Section 3 or Section 4, $500 fine; for vio-lating Section 5, $500 fine and six months in the' peni-tentiary; for violating Section 6, hanged by the neck until dead; for violating Section 7, penitentiary for life; for violating Section 8, fine or imprisonment, in the dis-cretion of the court; for violating Section 9, imprison-ment, in the discretion of the court; for violating Sec-tion 10, fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court. "SECTION 12. This Act shall take effect and be in force from and after‚  its publication in the statute book." If this proposed measure stood alone as the only thing of the kind which has been brought to public no- tice, it might be dismissed as a joke. But the facts of the situation justify something more than its mere mention as a piece of "freak" legislation. This proposed measure only contemplates in part, and on a small scale, what is proposed in the "Christian Amendment" to the Constitution, which has progressed far beyond the possibilities of a joke. That amendment says that "the revealed will of Jesus Christ" shall be "the supreme authority in civil affairs" in every State in the Union. The revealed will of Christ includes the law of ten commandments. The "Christian Amendment would do for every State what Mr. Walters' measure pro-poses to do for the State of Kansas. It is proposed that the Kansas legislature shall enact, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." As the speaking party in this enactment would be the legisla-ture, the law would be that the legislature must be the god of everybody in the State. And the god who speaks the law having been determined in the first section of the Act, the same god would be meant by the phrase "the Lord thy God" in succeeding sections. Thus by the third section it would become blasphemy to speak lightly of the Kansas legislature, and in the fourth section this assembly would put forth the stupendous claim of having created the heavens and the earth I Absurd as such claims would be, they are no more than what is really involved in every instance of reli-gious legislation. For religion being the performance of those duties which an individual owes to his God, only God can rightfully command such duties; and when such duties are commanded by any party, that party by that very act assumes to be God. Every law upon the statute books of the States which enjoins the observance of the "Lord's day," involves nothing less than the claim that the law-making party is God. Yet these "sabbath" laws are to be found upon the statute books of almost every State, and they are not generally regarded as examples of "freak" legislation. Neither, as stated, is the proposed "Christian Amend-ment" so regarded by the vast majority of those com-posing the churches and religious societies. And so strong is the support which these give to it, and so potent has their influence upon Congress been shown to be, that the "Christian lobbyists" who have charge of it at the seat of government are actually hopeful that the Na-tional Assembly will take favorable action upon it during their next session. , It should be observed also that by Mr. Walters' bill the seventh day of the week will be made the legal sab- bath in the State of Kansas. For the fourth command-ment plainly says "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work;" and any almanac affords proof that the day "commonly called Sunday" is the first day of the week and not the seventh. The Sunday law itself commonly specifies that Sunday is the "first day of the week." "The seventh day" and "the first day" of that division of time which the Sabbath marks, cannot be one and the same day.
