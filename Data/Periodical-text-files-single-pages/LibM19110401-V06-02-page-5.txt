LIBERTY Proilaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof. Lev. 25 :10. VoL. VI   SECOND QUARTER, 1911 No. 2             Editorial CHARACTER can not be hammered out on the anvil of human law. RELIGION is, and must be, outside the purview of just civil government. RELIGION bereft of divine power, turns to the state as its patron saint. That it could come to a place where it could make such a choice, explains the reason why heaven had withdrawn its power. INSTITUTIONS are the servants of men. Laws made to protect institutions at the sacrifice of human rights rest upon a basis artificial, unwise, and iniquitous. A law forbidding labor on Sunday rests on such a basis. THE incivility of an act is not deter-mined by the day upon which it is done. To decide that acts which are civil on Monday or Thursday are uncivil on Sunday, is to make a mockery of law, and to " fix " the balances of justice in which are weighed the rights of men. THE discussions found in this journal are not academic. The principles of American freedom are not visionary, but fundamental and vital. The attack upon those principles by great and influential organizations is the sufficient reason for this journal's existence. IF the government has the right to tax men one seventh of their time on ac-count of religion, it has the right to tax them a portion of their income for the support of religion. The latter propo-sition was long ago repudiated. It is high time the former should be likewise disposed of. To make special laws for Sunday is to place that day in a class by itself, and the only possible reason for the distinction is a religious one. But the government has no right to distinguish between either days or men on account of religion. It can not do so without, in effect, establish-ing the religion which it thus favors, and that our national Constitution wisely and justly forbids.
