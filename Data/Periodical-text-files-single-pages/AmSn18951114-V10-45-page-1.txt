A moral person is a cre- ation of God; the State is a creation of man. Man cannot create anything possessing moral accountability. Very many believe, however, that the State is a moral person, and that it is therefore bound by the moral standard of righteousness. And as it is the business of the State to set bounds about the pathway of each of its subjects and compel all to keep within those bounds, it follows that the State, if it must shape its action by the moral law, has on its hands nothing less than the task of enforcing the moral law upon all its subjects. And if the State has this task and is competent to perform it, there is no longer any necessity in the world for God. The Christian Statesman, in attempting to defend the doctrine of the State's moral ac-countability, says: " Although to term the State a moral person may seem to be a some-what abstruse and philosophical definition, it is in fact the same as the popular conception which embodies itself in such national per-sonifications as John Bull' and Brother Jonathan.' " We will admit that the State is _just as much a moral person as the familiar figures: which in modern pictorial journalism represent " John Bull" and " Uncle Sam," are real beings. A moral person is answerable to the moral law,Šthe ten commandments. All individ-uals in the world are moral persons, in the sense of being amenable to this law. They are such because God created them and en-dowed them with moral faculties, and pro-vided for the keeping by each one of his moral law. This is not true of the State. It is true of each individual in the State, so far as concerns himself, but not of the representative capacity with which the people may have en-dowed him. Can any person be good for another? Can one keep the moral law for another? In other words, will the righteousness of one person avail for another, under any conceivable cir-cumstances? The righteousness of Christ, and him alone, will avail for another, and for all men; and this is the inscrutable " mystery of godliness." It is as far above and beyond the power and wisdom of man as the heavens are above the earth. Now it is true under every republican form of government that when the State acts in any way, it acts through representatives of the people. Whether it be the town consta-ble or the President of the United States, if he acts in his official capacity, it is as the rep-resentative of the people who have chosen him to office; so that his action is their action. And therefore if, as the people's representa-tive, he were bound to conform to the moral law, his righteousness would be their right-eousness! Thus this doctrine of the State's moral accountability is nothing else than a scheme which puts man in the place of Christ. Let us beware of all such doctrine. And more than this; it not only puts man in the place of the Saviour, but puts him also in the place of Jehovah; since as we have seen, it puts upon the State the responsibil-ity of enforcing on all its subjects the moral law. This of course the State cannot do, for the moral law is spiritual, taking cognizance of the thoughts and motives of the heart. The Saviour plainly declared this in the sermon on the mount, when he spoke of the command-ments prohibiting killing and adultery. The State can take cognizance only of outward acts. Thus as we follow out the logic of this doc-trine, we are led deeper and deeper into ab-surdity. Not only can the State not enforce the moral law, but it cannot keep it. There is only one way in which the moral law can be kept, and this is defined by Paul in Gal. 2: 20: " I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." In other words, Christ alone is able to fulfill perfectly the moral law, and man is able to keep it only by having Christ keep it in him. But Christ lives not in every person, but only in such as are Christians, and the conditions necessary to his indwelling are repentance and  conversion. But the State is so constituted that it cannot come into real touch with any of the gospel provisions. So far as they are concerned, the State is as intangible as are the pictorial figures representing "John Bull" and "Brother Jonathan." As before stated, the State is a creation of man. It is constituted by the action of the people, in delegating the powers they them-selves possess, to representatives, in order that they may not live in confusion and anarchy. And as the powers thus delegated are the same in all persons, all have the same right to rep-resentation; all have an equal voice in the se-lection of representatives, and the persons chosen represent all classes alike. These in-dividuals may or may not be Christians, but as representatives, they are entirely without the sphere of religion, for they must repre-sent different individuals,ŠChristians, Jews, atheists, the religious and the non-religious, at the same time; and it is obvious that this cannot be done with reference to anything more than the powers delegated to them, which an individual would use to guard his natural right to " life, liberty, and the pur-suit of happiness." Even were it possible that the State could be Christian in character by having only Christians as the representatives of the people, this would be grossly unfair to all other classes, and such persons would not be repre-sentatives in fact; nor would it be possible to choose such representatives with any degree of certainty; for who can tell what man is truly a Christian save He who has power to look upon and read the heart ? One Christian cannot even represent another Christian, as such. So far as moral account-ability is concerned, he can represent only himself. A representative of the people is both a rep-resentative and an individual; and as an in-dividual, he is bound under all circumstances by the moral law. If he be a Christian, his Christianity will lead him as an individual to conform to the requirements of the moral law and of the gospel. And the same Christianity will lead him, as a representative of others, to carefully refrain from any interference with their rights and liberties; for by his power as representative, those very rights and liber-ties are to be protected. All moral accountability is individual ac-
