316 AMERICAN SENTINEL. An Image to the Beast. "CHARLIE, for whatpurpose was thetwo-horned beast to call down fire from heaven?" "To deceive those that dwell on the earth," said Charlie. "With this manifestation, what does he command men to do?" Charlie opened to Rev. 13 and read, "Saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast." "Now, Charlie, what is an image?" "Why, it's a likeness, a resemblance." "Then as we are dealing with symbols, and have lo-cated the beast as a symbol of the papacy, what would making an image to the beast mean?" "Making something like the papa-cy." "And what was the papacy?" "It was a union of church and state, or a system by which men who served God in opposition to unjust stat-utes, were dealt with as malefactors. "Why, mama, that is the way Jesus was dealt with. In our worship this morning I read the verse that says, 'If he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him unto you.' "Yes, the Jews represented the religious factor, and the Romans the law. But as a civil power Rome found no fault with Jesus. Neither would any civil power within its legitimate sphere, find any fault with Christ's followers. But Jesus was crucified for his Godlikeness. The accusation was, that he made himself the Son of God. Yet his crucifixion was not counted persecution by Rome. The tortures of the Inquisition have been justified by the papacy, because the persecutors had worked until their malignity to the followers of Christ could be gratified in the name of law. The events of our own day show that men are following in the same cruelty-beaten track, and the beast in men is saying, 'Let us make an image to the beast.' Let us make religious laws that have no right to a place among civil laws≈†laws that conflict with men's rights and the plain statements of God's Word, in order that we may afflict those who are loyal to God,and do it in the name of law, to place them before the world as malefactors. But shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? God will be able to see and to sweep away the refuge of lies." "But, mama, the mass of the people who will be led into this kind of iniquity will be ignorant of the real pur-pose of the movement." "We will talk of that another time. I want to ask you if this movement for the union of church and state will simply end in talk,--end in placing upon our statute books dead-letter laws? Please read the next verse." "And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that he should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed." "You remember Jesus said that the servant was not  greater than his Lord. He said, if they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also. Many of the religious and scientific teachers of to-day contend that the world is growing better. Though they have to face appalling records of growing crime, see poverty increasing and wealth growing unfeeling, look upon all nations as a huge armament, and see a fallen church suing for civil power, yet they soothe men's fears by crying 'peace and safety.' They scoff at the Word of God that declares evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, and that the last days are to be perilous. They declare that the spirit of the Dark Ages has departed, that never again will perse-cution stain the hands of men. But the infallible Word declares that 'all who will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.' " "And, so, mama, do you think that the followers of Christ before this age closes will be killed for their faith?" "The prophecy declares that the decree of death will certainly be passed upon them. There are other script-ures that we will examine later that indicate that a su-pernatural deliverance will binder the fulfillment of the death warrant. But you may read on in the prophecy." " 'And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."' "The mark that men will be required to receive is not a literal mark. We have found the prophet speaking in symbolical language all along. It is a mark that is received in the mind, something that is assented to and received by belief. It is also to be received in the right hand. Those who do not assent to it in their minds, will nevertheless yield the hand for its requirement. Now whose mark is it, Charlie?" "The mark of the beast." "Yes. It is the sign or mark of the authority and nature of the beast. We have located the beast as the papacy, and have already proved that Sunday observ-ance is claimed by the Catholic Church as a mark of her authority. It is certainly a sign of the nature that seeks but its own gratification. In presuming to change God's law, of which Jesus said, not one jot or tittle should pass till heaven and earth passed, we can see that the papacy has set aside the authority of God and exalted itself above God. God is love, and in setting aside God, they have set aside love. Love is spiritual, and in setting aside love, they have set aside the spiritual, and the thing that is left is the carnal mind. But the carnal mind is enmity against God, it is 'not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.' The characteristic of the beast is made manifest in self indulgence, self-exaltation, in outward display, in enmity toward those who stand loyal to God, who are in harmony with his nature. So in substituting Sunday, the first day of the week, for the Sabbath, the seventh day, they have substituted the mark of the nature and authority of the beast. The au-thority of the beast is the authority that is backed up
