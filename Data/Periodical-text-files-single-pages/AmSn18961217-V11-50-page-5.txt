DECEMBER 17, 1896. AIVICIFtICAN  391  to make it possible for all who would, to have the privilege of resting one day in seven, and that those engaged in business should not be obliged to sustain a financial loss at the hands of their competitors who for any reason did not see fit to close the doors of their business on that day. Mayor McVicar in his address of welcome said, among other things:Š It is not alone from a moral standpoint that we value the day of rest. The benefits of the Christian sabbath from a political point of view are universally conceded, for where the sabbath is best observed, there you find the highest order of civilization. Rev. Dr. Marshall said :Š I am glad to welcome this convention to our city, because its purpose is to lay emphasis upon the pres-ervation of our holy rest day. By whatever name it is known, it means much. Whether we have the old, old name of Sabbath or rest day, whether it be the last good name givenŠLord's dayŠor whether it be that other name, SundayŠwhich I like to spell Son-day instead of Sunday, because it is the day specially given to sanctify to us Christ's resurrectionŠit means more than many suppose. . . . I welcome you here because you have come to devise ways to make the observance of the Lord's day a popular thing. . . . Now, in these Sunday laws no one has thought to do another injury. They have all been planned on the part of man, as the moral law is on the part of God, for the good of mankind. They are to be helpful, not hurtful; it is not to take away the rights of anyone, but to give those rights to the peo-ple that they do not now enjoy. . . . I hope we may here learn to better speak of this sabbath, so that those who have not seen it from the standpoint of religious instruction may see in it as a civil insti-tution a great blessing that ought to be preserved, and that we may be able to gain their earnest, con-scientious helpful support in preserving the day as a holy one to the American people. The Only Basis of Union. Rev. E. L. Eaton, pastor of the First Methodist Church of Des Moines, and until recently actively connected with the " Sab-bath Rescue" work in Wisconsin, was per-haps the most pronounced in his views as to what is desired, and what the religious ele-ment proposes to do when it gets the power. Even a synopsis of his discourse would cover too much space to incorporate in this report. Suffice it to say, he declared that we are past the day when moral suasion can be effectually used in raising the standard of Sunday ob-servance;  that if the day is to be preserved as a rest day, it must be done from the civil standpoint. He would stop the busy wheels of commerce and industry and have quiet and rest in all the homes of the land. He said that the battle now on is the same old one that Nehemiah fought 2400 years agoŠit was not that the fish venders of that time should be compelled to become Jews, worship the same God that they did, and conform to their religious requirements; but it was that the Sabbath day should not be used by them for gain; and that, he declared, was the pivotal point for which Sabbath re-formers to-day contendŠthat Sunday, which is regarded by the American people as the Sabbath, shall not be devoted to making money. He said that everywhere the senti-ment is growing that in order to preserve the day as a holy one, it must be protected by law; indeed, he did not believe there was another point on which all denominations could unite except this one of enforced Sun-day rest. On it " Catholics, Lutherans and all other Protestants could as brothers work together in a great cause that is worthy of their effort." Then to conclude his address he said :Š We want to touch legislation; we want to go over yonder into that Capitol building and sit there among the law makers with as much serenity and with as much right as do the lobbyists of the great corpora-tions. We want to put our finger on the moral pulse of the legislature until they feel the power of our  influence to the extent that they dare not refuse our demands. Another paper of interest was prepared by Mrs. E. H. Slocum, entitled, "A Progression that Needs to be Recognized and Resisted." In it she laid at the doors of church-going people the blame of a large share of Sunday desecration. In a most graphic and castigat-ing manner, she paid her respects to the Christian Endeavorers for patronizing the Sunday trains when they attended the na-tional convention at Boston; and declared that they could never hope for the day to be observed as it should be by the people at large, when those who were supposed to be its conservators were such open and flagrant violators of it. Rev. J. C. Jacoby spoke on the subject, "The Sabbath in Relation to Our Civil Gov-ernment." The central thought was to the effect that while the sabbath was established under a theocratic form of government, later forms of government became equally respon-sible for its observance. The fact that the State and Church are now separated does not change their relation to the Creator. Both the State and the individual should observe the sabbath; corporations, too, should keep the sabbath. There should be more laws, and a better enforcement of them against sabbath desecration. He believed that organized cap-ital is largely responsible for the demoraliza-tion of sabbath observance. Didn't Know What They Were Talking About. He was followed by C. A. Dudley, Esq. a prominent attorney of the city, who took him to task for the narrowness of his views. He told him that he was talking about that which he did not understand; that the corporations of the city were far better sabbath observers than many of their most prominent church people; the banks and loan and trust compa-nies close their offices, and the railroads would do likewise, but because of the demand for their servicesŠin most instances from the church-going people. And more, were it not for the demand of the professedly Christian people of the land, the Sunday mails would not be delivered. The trouble with them was that they wanted the earth on their side; but were unwilling to grant a single conces-sion to the others. This was downright sel-fishness. He said he had no sympathy with those who were decrying this generation as wholly given over to the world, the flesh and the devilŠif they didn't believe him let them go and read up D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation. What the people needed to-day was not legislation to compel the observance of the day, but backbone to follow out their convic-tions. Sunday laws at most could only pro-tect the day as a civil institution, and with the religious phase of the question it had nothing whatever to do. Just as soon as it did, then look out for the rack and thumb-screw. The majority of those in favor of Sunday laws did not understand the matter, and it was time for them to post up if they ever expected to place their work on a basis that would command the respect and coopera-tion of thinking, liberty-loving people. The Puritan and the Continental Sunday. " The European or American Sabbath, Which?" was the title of a flowery paper, by Rev. T. P. Robb. As a preface to it, he stated that he felt a moral certainty in the fact that the Holy Spirit had impressed him to write what he had, over a month before the convention; and therefore felt perfectly  clear in presenting it, although the subject matter had been given by others before him. Then he drew the picture of an ideal, Puri-tanical sabbath, which, according to him, was known only in America, and then contrasted with it a Sunday in Paris where none of the sabbath restraints were known, and where it existed only as a holiday. The harvest of offenders in the police courts of Paris on each Monday as the result of the carousals of the previous day, had its coun-terpart only in the 5th of July in America. The day is given over to revelling by the rich, while the poor were compelled to toil in abject slaveryŠand is such a day as we will have here in America in a very short time unless a check is made on the encroachments of the "Continental Sunday." "Already," he said, "the sabbath in our land has been literally stolen from the poor man, and its desecration is sapping the life-blood from our national life as nothing else is, and there-fore, I say, we cannot keep quiet. Friends of the sabbath cause, awake!" Immediately following this, Hon. 0. 0. Roe took the floor, and said that he had pre-pared a paper to be read; but would leave it for another time, and simply talk a little. Then in a quaint and quiet manner he described Sunday as it was observed in his father's home when he was a boy, and strangely enough it corresponded in almost every particular with the ideal sabbath of the previous speaker. "But this," said Mr. Roe, "was not in America, but in Continental EuropeŠin a country of 2,000,000 inhabit-ants in which there were fewer murders com-mitted in a year than in some counties in Iowa in a month." He resented the idea that the question was America against Europe, the American sab-bath against the Continental Sunday. It was not that, but it was the spirit of Christ against the spirit of the world. The contest was in every country on the globe, and he didn't want the audience to get the impression from the previous speaker's remarks that only in America was Sunday observed as it should be; for there was just as good sabbath-keeping in Europe as anywhere. He thought the people should not forget pious Europe, for it was from there that the good old fathers and mothers came who laid the foundation of our Government. He said he had looked in vain for a truly American sabbath, such as had been portrayed Ša day observed in the spirit in which the Almighty designed it should be; but he was sorry to say that even in this the most glori-ous land the sun ever shone upon, it was not to be found, and from the present outlook he was afraid it never would be found. He reminded his hearers that Americans did not need to leave their native shores to find all the inherent meanness of humanity, for right here among us were evils that Continental Europe knew nothing of, and if America would but look to herself, the denunciation of the prophet of long ago would applyŠ"America, thou art the transgressor." Here everything in the way of luxury, gratification and wantonness is demanded by those who can afford it, while at the same time these very ones were among those who are seeking by legislation to curtail the liberties and priv-ileges of those who produced the wealth that these rich and greedy men enjoy. Then in an inimitable manner he drew a picture of a foreigner with his wife and chil-dren, who, because of his limited compensa-tion, is obliged to take quarters in some rickety tenement row above the stench of a teeming city. No minister ever visits him, and he never attends church, because he
