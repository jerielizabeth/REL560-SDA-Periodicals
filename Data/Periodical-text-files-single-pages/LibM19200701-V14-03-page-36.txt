John 6:15. " It is not right to do right the wrong way. It was right that Jesus should be king: it was wrong to seek to make him king by force. It is right that men should pray: it would be wrong to attempt to force men to pray. It is right that men should come to church: it would be wrong to force any one to come to the sanctuary. You can by force compel a man to pay his debts. Is that compelling him to be honest? The very attempt to force men to be religious destroys the temper which alone makes religion possible. Jesus Christ himself would never con-sent  to reign over the soul by mere force. If you would force men to Christ, you could not force Christ to men."Å  Joseph Parker, D. D.
