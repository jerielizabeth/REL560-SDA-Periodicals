No; the situation as it is is not all nor any one of these things. In the plain and direct statements which we quoted last week the froth of imperialism is dispensed with, and the thing itself stands before us just as it is. The question as it is is not to be settled by a campaign of guerilla warfare in the Philippines. It is not neces-sary for any American to go ten thousand miles from the capital of his country and seventhousand miles from the western seaboard in order to meet the situation as it is. The language which we quoted last week from leading imperialists brings home to every American citi-zen the real situation, which he can, and does, face as he stands on his own threshold. The thing with which the American people are brought face to face is this: Shall the natural and ina-lienable rights of American freemen, which have been rec-ognized and guaranteed to them in the Constitution of their fathers, continue to be upheld by that Constitu-tion, or shall those rights become dependent upon the will and caprice of men who have arrogated to them-selves supreme and irresponsible powers, and who pro-pose to "consecrate" and to "stamp legality" upon their acts by means of an "expansive" and "elastic" constitution "interpreted by men supremely great?" Is the American Government to be a government of law or is it to be a government of will by men who know no law but "destiny" and the "inexorable logic of events," and who declare that they are not wise enough and that they know of no one "who is wise enough or sufficiently imormed to determine what form of government will best subserve . . . our interests and our well being?" Are the plain statements of the American Constitution to stand as they are written and to mean what they say, or are they to become subject to the jugglery of "stern men with empires in their brains?"* The question is: Is American law to be corrupted at its very fountainhead; is justice to be thrown into the streets; and is equiry to be debarred from the American Constitution? Instead of being a matter of "holding in trust the liberties of nearly twelve millions of human beings," it is a question of striking down the instrument which is the legal bulwark of the liberties of nearly one hundred millions of human beings. Instead of being a question of "dither Spain or the United States in the *That is the exact expression used by Theodore Roosevelt in an enthu-siastic speech in favor of imperialism, delivered in Chicago on April 10.
