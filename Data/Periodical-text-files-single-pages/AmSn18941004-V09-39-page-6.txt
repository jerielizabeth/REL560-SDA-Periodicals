316 VoL. 9, No. 39. priations for only a few parochial schools that appear upon the surface, beginning on page 51 with St. Boniface's School, in California, and the Holy Family School, in Montana, et al; but the " milk of the cocoanut" is found in the statement with which I have been furnished from the office of Indian Affairs, and I wish to say right here in this connection, that when I first asked for this information relative to denominational schools, my clerk was in-formed by the assistant commissioner, who I am told is a zealous member of the church which has its headquarters upon the Tiber, that it could not be supplied. I of course was astonished to receive this message indicating that the bureau was in ignorance of the facts, or that the request of a member of Congress for in-formation had been refused by a depart-ment, but upon sending a second time for a reply in writing to my letter, I received the following remarkable statement that I wish read and printed as abbreviated in the Record as a portion of my remarks, showing the number and' class of schools under the office of Indian Affairs, and to which the people of this country have been contributing millions of dollars. Now, that a large majority of ecclesias-tical bodies, realizing the wrong, have severed the bond of Church and State, we should take action here to-day that will prevent subsidizing the schools of Mother DeChantal, Gerhard Terhorst, Pius Boehm, Balthasar Feusi, S. J. Sister Kunigunda, Rev. Aloysius M. Folchi, and others whose euphonious names have not been hereto-fore called to the attention of American people. I ask the clerk to read this state-ment. The clerk read as follows :- Contract schools, giving the total amounts required for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894. School, location, and contractor.-Catholic.

We are aware that this statement will be declared, by three classes, as sounding an alarm without cause; namely, the egotistic ignorant, the cowardly compro-mising, and the time-serving politician-the three worst foes of civil and religious liberty. But these are times when it be-comes thoughtful citizens who have some knowledge of history, and who understand the situation in these history-making days, to be candid and wise, steady and coura-geous, and to stand together on the tenable ground of impregnable principle, which recognizes the equal rights of all and re-pudiates special privileges to any. . . . The enemy have said : " We will wait a little in hiding, and the spasm will soon pass off, and then we will come out in the open again." Is it not time that the oc-casional spasm should change to a normal and healthful permanence of purpose and action ? Mr. Chairman, I am not an alarmist, but the annals of earth are replete with tales of danger, trouble, and war, caused by religious rivalry, zeal, and hate, when Church and State are in any way con-nected, and it matters not in how slight degree. Already we are told of riots taking place, and that blood has been shed at elections in some of our cities, and we hear the murmurs of discontent, of dissatisfaction with and denunciation of the methods employed iu this bill. Will you not take warning from the past by heeding the protests of great religious denominations; by heeding the resolutions passed by many, many civic organizations; by heeding the demands of almost the entire population of our country, declaring that this nefarious system of paying mil- lions of the people's money to priestly agents of sectarian institutions must im-mediately cease. So long as you continue this system so long will the religious agitation now sweeping over the country continue. Some may claim that I am bringing religion into politics, but far, far from it. I am trying to divorce the two in order that we may have no more of the combin-ation; neither have I opposed this bill because one aggressive church whose rul-ing power is in a foreign land gets the lion's share of the spoils (as one of the largest beneficiaries to lose, I believe in amount received in case of the defeat of sectarian appropriations, is the Society of Friends, a sect for which I have the great-est respect, and to which a majority of my own people belong, and have since they landed in Penn's time, two centuries ago), but I oppose it, believing honestly that its whole principle is radically and everlast-ingly wrong in America. Significant Paragraphs. [We publish under this heading paragraphs more or less significant, without either approval or dissent, and without comment. The careful observer of the signs of the times will readily discern the pertinent facts and opinions, and will know how to turn them to account in the great controversy between truth and error.] Some People Can Work on Sunday if They Want To. THREE carpenters, 0. F. Noble, of 20 Holyoke Street, Frank Schoonard, of 67 Minton Street, and H. A. Cook, of 57 Walton Avenue, repaired a little photo-graph gallery on wheels, Sunday, and were arrested for violating the Stinday labor law. But the policeman who made the arrest did not know that the men were Seventh-day Adventists. He was aston-ishtd when they "gave him the laugh," and lie called it impudence. On Monday morning Prosecutor Fiedler got down his law book and began to look for informa-tion. He found that persons who con-scientiously held the seventh day as a day of worship could not be prosecuted for working on the first day. Then the cases were, nolled. The policeman turned a sickly smile on the prosecutor and went down the stairs whistling " Every Day'll Be Sunday By and By."- Cleveland ( Ohio) Press, Sept. 17. Divine Punishment. " I LIKE your paper very much. I would like to ask you if the Scripture does not warrant us in the belief that the present fearful drought and failure of crops is not due to the desecration of the Sabbath ? For all through this country there will more gather to watch baseball players on the Sabbath than attend church." In reply: Sometimes we can see the connection between the sin and God's pun-ishment of it. When we see the apple hanging on the tree we can say that it has grown on the tree. But sometimes we cannot see the connection between a par-ticular sin and a special display of God's anger against sin; and then we cannot assert that the visitation is the result of the one sin alone. Sabbath desecration leads to political corruption, through the daily papers which are the teachers and leaders of the people. We first teach the reporters and editors that God commands rest: and then as a body politic we afford them protection and aid in publishing, distributing and
