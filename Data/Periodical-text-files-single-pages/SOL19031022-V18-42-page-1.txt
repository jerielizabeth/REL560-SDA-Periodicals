The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY Vol. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., OCTOBER 22, 1903 NO. 42 The  religious liberty of an individual is a matter of the relation between himself and God; and he alone of all human beings has it within his power. John Bunyan declared after his twelve years' imprisonment in Bedford jail that he was never so free in all his life as at times in his dungeon when communing with God and reading his Bible in a dim ray of light. No human power can invade and take away the lib-erty of the soul. "By their fruits ye shall know them. He is the free man in whom the mystery of goodness manifests itself. He is the apostle of freedom who is so inspired by truth and right-eousness that no bonds can hold him. By the experience of all true men who have been in bondage since the world began. it has been proved that freedom of the spirit has been won and defended by those who have exercised themselves to have a conscience devoid of offense toward God and man, who have been humble and teachable, who have wrought in love and in wisdom, who have followed the Power from on high; and w5o, through loving hearts and billing hands, ha'be brought this Power to bear in all their rtx, orks and Ivays."
