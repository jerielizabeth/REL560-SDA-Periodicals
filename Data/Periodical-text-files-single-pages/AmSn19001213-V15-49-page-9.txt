SENTENEL, 777 George Fox himself, that in this,,matter Mr. Williams was, untrue to his principles,. and. that- he, to some extent, sanctioned their persecution. In another paper- we shall. consider this accusation. G. E. .FIFIELEr.- THE SPIRIT O TYRANNY RAMPANT',  IN OUR REPUBLIC: THE folloWing by Ella Wheeler Wilcox in the Chicago. American is a cogent, comment upon the trend of the times. The incident related may seem trivial 'in itself, but it only one of a great many.  things of like character whiCh go to make hp a very large part of American life as it, is-now lived. The writer we quote says: "What is the use of talking about living in a ChtiSlian democracy, when every day of our lives we are silent witnesses to or aiders and abettor'S 'acts of petty injustice and tYratiny which belong to a heathen monarchy. "For' instance, you occupy the seventh floor of 'a large apartment house.  You prefer to be ,high up above the dust and noise, and near the air and light. ' "You have many telegrams and C. 0. D. parcels. There is but one elevator' for passengers, With a freight -basement compartment, and in the rear of the house a dumb-waiter: "The owner of the building has' instructed the elevator boys to bring up. no messengers and no parcels in the passenger elevator. "This is "understood to be a rule formed for the comfort and convenience of tenants. "But why has he not had the humane thought to say to:these elevator attendants: Ł ",` Tell:boys 'who have collections to make to send parcels up by the dumb-waiter, and to return and take_ the 'freight elevator;, treat all who come .to this house with consideration and politeness, whether drivers of wagons,, laundrymen, or the President of the United States?' "The man who would' make, one request of his employes of this kind would' be aiding the march Of. Christian civilization far more' than by large sub-scriptions to church and niissiO-n,  work " I called recently at an. apartment house on Fifty-seVerith. Street, New York. A pale, arirnic, ill-fed and delicate looking white boy, with a basket of groceries, was being berated by a lusty colored elevator . attendant. " Just you ring 'the bell on the sixth floor, and see if the lady is home,"- the small boy was saying. 4  I went up all them stairs orict,_ and couldn't 'get no answer.' " 'Go up yerselfŠthere's the stairs,' responded the bronze lord of the elevator: I'm not here to do your woik.' " ' But just ring def bellŠit won't take a .Minit;' pleaded the boy.. If she ain't in sure, I'll take the basket back.' "'Why don't you take the boy, up?' I asked, Put' his basket in the dumb-waiter and let him ride up: Five flights-is a long climb for, the little fellow to take again.' , " Them'S my orders, lady,' the elevator king replied. ' No delivery boys allowed 'in heah.' " He seemed to feel the vast difference in his' social. status as he referred to the delivery boys. " That is one of the worst features of this thoughtlessness on the part of the proprietors of such. buildings. Not only is there no consideration shown the army of delivery men and messenger boys, but the spirit of the sycophant and bully is: fostered in the apartment attendant. He is .taught to bow and scrape and be courteous to tenants and callers, but allowed to be brusque and brutal to people whom he looks upon as his inferiors. " It is the spirit of the old world of monarchiCal tyranny, from which America revolted, set free and rampant again in our Republic. " It is all wrongŠLun-dernecraticŠun-ChristianŠuncivilized. ' " It is on a par with the inhuman architecture - in most of our houses and apartment- building's, where the room intended for the prop of the home, the domestic, is only fit for a dog's kennelŠcramped; uncomfortable and unventilated. " And all these unjust conditions, placed in appalling contrast with the princely luxury of the wealthy and idle classes, are little streams which flow into the great river .of 'righteous discontent which is sweeping through our land. ILit rise and inundate the whole social structure some day, Whose fault will it be? " So many gods, so many creeds, So many paths that wind and wind', While just the art of being kind Is all the sad world needs." - BISHOP THOBURN (Methodist), of India, thinks that within ten years the United States will be governing a hundred millions of Chinese in their own land. " If ever the policy of an adminiStration'was in-dorsed by a people, the course of this administration in the Philippines has been indorsed." So say's Senator Lodge.
