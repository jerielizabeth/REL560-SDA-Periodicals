LII  ' Proclaim liberty throughout all theland unto all the inhabitants thereof." Leviticus 25: io. in,  VOL. XV FIRST QUARTER, 1920 NO. 1 A New World a Political Impossibility By the Managing Editor DURING the World War, and especially as the great struggle drew to its close, it was often predicted that as a result, in fact, as the great result, we should have a new world. A single sample statement, from a clergyman, may be quoted : " When this war is over, we shall find a purged world, a world that has seen the error of its ways, and which will rise to a higher plane morally a n d spiritually." But where are the indication s that this ideal is being or is to be realized? Where are the signs of any such tendency in any nation or in the hearts of any people ?

Indeed, even in the most sorely war-stricken coun-tries, the coming of peace was fol- lowed quickly, not by repentance for past sins, but by a far deeper plunge into sin. The trouble with the optimism that sees new and better things coming forth from the ashes of the old, so to speak,Šof the pre-war world,Š is that it leaves God and his law out of the reckoning. The great w a r ending in the ar-mistice of Nov. 11, 1918, or the pass-ing of that war, did not give the world the hoped-for peace. Instead of a single war there were pres-ently more than a score of smaller wars, and ever since there h a s been little but po-litical and indus-trial trouble, in-volving much ac-tual war, and this not in a single country, but in many countries.
