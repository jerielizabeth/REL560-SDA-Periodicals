AMERICAN SENTINEL. 743 Churches shows that the leaders in this movement would not stop with a mere "formal recognition of God" in the Constitution. It is a "reverent" and "pious" acknowl-edgment of God, according to their idea of what that means, that is desired. The enforcement of Sunday ob-servance by law especially would be demanded. Infatuated with the idea that the kingdom of Christ must "enter the reatm of law through the gateway of politics," the religio-political reformers of to-day are turning from the heaven-appointed means for reforming men to the satanic agencies of force in religious matters. It has been the use of force which has brought persecu-tion to dissenters in all ages. But force in matters of re-ligion never made one true Christian. It has filled mill-ions with a fear of ecclesiastical and civil penalties, and made many hypocrites, but it never made a Christian. The gospel draws the sinner by its own inherent power of love. It compels no one's will, but wins its way to the heart by its mercy and compassion. God's way of reforming men is indicated in the fol-lowing scriptures:Š "I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God." "I, Paul, myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ." "Exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day." "As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." Such is the tenor of the Scriptures all the way through. We are to beseech, entreat, exhort, persuade, and constrain men by the.  love of God, but not to force any one. It is all to be done in the manner set forth in the Golden Rule: "As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." Luke 6:31. Love is that secret cord by which the Infinite One draws the souls of men to Christ for salvation. This is evident from many passages. The Lord says to the sinner, "I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lov-ing-kindness have I drawn thee. Jer. 31:3. "I healed them; I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love." Hosea 11:3, 4. The Lord does not put upon us any grievous yoke. He does not force us into his service. He invites us to come. "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." He takes off the griev-ous yoke that the compulsory service of sin has imposed,  and sets us free that we may render to him voluntary service. He says : "And I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them!,  Hosea 11:4, And he tells his people that they too should "break every yoke" and "let the oppressed go free." Isaiah 58. This is the gospel way. This is God's way, the way of mercy and love. Christ said to Peter, "Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. 26:52. Our Saviour used no outward force to gain followers, and he asked no armies to help his disciples to carry on the gospel after his as-cension. He told them that they should be witnesses for  him after they should receive power from on high; but Jesus plainly taught that his kingdom is not of this world, and that therefore his_ servants do not fight. John 18:36. Why, then, do many of Christ's professed followers seek to use the very means which he condemned? Let him ,answer it. He says, "U they have persecuted .me, they will also persecute you; . . . but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. . . . They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea, the time cometh, that who-soever killeth you will think that he doeth God serviceŁ And these things will they do unto you because'they have not known the Father, nor me." John 15:20, 21; 16: 2, 3. This is the reason why professed Christians perse-cute the true children of God; they are not acquainted with either Christ or his Father. Persecutors know only Satan's gospel of force, and that is why they want the aid of the civil law to back up their church practices and religious forms, and it does not require any change of heart to do this. A formal recognition of God in a civil constitution comports very well with a mere outward profession of religion. True religion is a matter of heart service to God, be gotten of love, not fear, for fear has only torment. Such a recognition enters into all the social and business rela-tions of life. He who makes it ever remembers that his Maker sees him; and that he must render account to God for all his acts. It is a matter of personal faith toward God. The Scriptures declare that "without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." Heb. 11:6. "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." Rom. 14:23. Then if any recogni-tion of God is not a matter of personal faith in God on the part of the individual who makes it, it is sin. The church has never yet joined hands with the civil power to enforce religious practices without soiling its garments, corrupting the state, and bringing disgrace upon the church and opprobrium upon the very name of religion through the persecution of godly men and women, under the garb of piety. Let all consider 'what such a union means. Be Tolerant. WHAT is known is sure; therefore be tolerant. There is much to be discovered ; be therefore twice tolerant. For want of this diffidence and modesty certain great persons in the pastŠsuch as Reformers and PuritansŠwere not by any means tolerant, were indeed filled at times with the spirit of persecution. They were very much convinced of truth, aŁnd were also certain they had all truth, and so fell into an arrogant and insolent tem-per, whose influence has not quite departed from their children.ŠBev.
