For the last six months of 1902, the International Sunday School Lessons are Ñ Studies ..:* .:*  in the Old Testament."  4. ..t.  The lesson topics selected by the Committee cover only a portion of the Bible history * *.f. from the "Giving of the Manna " (the subject of the first lesson) to the time of Samuel. .:.  The subjects considered contain lessons of great importance, and yet they must of t ::?.. necessity be somewhat fragmentary, since they are ofttimes widely separated chronolog- ically. On this account some " help " covering this portion of the Bible connectedly will * be most valuable. Such a " help " is to be had in "PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS." It covers the whole * period, not as a Bible history, but in a topical study of the most important subjects. from  ..1... .;... the entrance of sin to the time of David. It shows "Why Sin Was Permitted" and por- ¥ traysin pleasing language and in a most interesting manner the controversy between the  forces of good and eÔ il, as illustrated in the lives of " holy men of old."  ;2; Nearly every lesson topic for the last half of the year is treated in this book and truths are brought out and such spiritual lessons drawn from the Scriptures, as are to be  , cP found in no other publication. Teachers or pupils who desire to really get the most good out of this series of lessons cannot afford to dt prive themselves of this " help." Each one will do well to read the .2. ti. book through by course during the study, thus getting a connected view of the events.  4 ¥:.  A leaflet giving references from the lesson to the pages in the book which treat on the ¥:¥  same subject will be furnished with each copy of " Patriarchs and Prophets."  ¥:.  ::: ¥:.  762 PAGES. $2.25 IN CLOTH. .:.
