                           LIBERTY       Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all Me inhabitant! thereof. Lev. 25:                                 Vol..

ONE speaker at the Catholic Eucha-ristic Congress declared that they ought to " welcome the enactment of civil laws that would punish all real desecration of the Sunday." Upon this matter of the enactment of religious legislation, there is no gulf between Protestantism (so-called) and Catholicism. The two forces are at one upon that question, and will be drawn still nearer through their mu-tual endeavors in that undertaking. THE evils of enforced idleness on Sun-day lie along two lines : the harm they do and the good they prevent. The harm they do is not alone to the Sabbath-keep-ing farmer and the artisan who must, through their instrumentality, refrain from labor on two days in the week, but to the people themselves who enforce the law upon such, and thus become unfeel-ing persecutors of those who are seeking
