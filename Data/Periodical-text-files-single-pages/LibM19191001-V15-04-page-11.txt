LIBERTY 89 measure, but neither in war nor peace should there be such an unholy affiance and dictation on the part of the Government and the Federal Council of the Churches or any other religious body." What we have quoted from Dr. Gray is said in no hard or faultfinding spirit. The Bap-tists, while not permitted to do all that they wished to do, did not sulk in their tents, but in spite of handicaps accomplished a good work. They cannot, however, help viewing with misgivings the growing tendency, not only of the Government as a whole, but of its sev-eral departments, to interfere more and more with matters of religion. The Constitution does not say that the Gov-ernment, either directly or through its several departments, shall not make any ruling or pro-mulgate any order interfering with the free exercise of religion, but it does say that Con-gress shall not do any such thing by law. In-asmuch as ours is pre-eminently a government of law, it seems only reasonable to believe that the prohibitions of the Constitution were in-tended to be just as binding upon the execu-tive as upon the legislative branch of the gov-ernment, and that therefore no department has legal power to do what is forbidden to the Congress. Of course nobody thinks for a moment that Secretary of War Baker had any intention of forming a union of church and state by execu-tive order. But it cannot be denied that for the time being " the Liberty Church," though so unique as to be scarcely entitled to be called a church, was in fact, if not the church of the United States Army, at least a church of  that army, protected and regulated by the War Department, subject to its direction, and in part financed by said Department, or in other words, by the United States through its War Department. In saying this there is no intention whatŁ ever to criticize any one unkindly. Doubtless Mr. Baker was moved to do what he did by patriotic motives, and no one denies that the Y. M. C. A. did much good. But it is more than questionable if better work could not have been done along religious lines if, instead of inaugurating a " Liberty Church," all denominations had been permitted to send accredited workers into the camps, not only at home, but overseas. We are not fully persuaded that it is ever necessary or even helpful for the Government, as such, to undertake to provide religious in-struction or religious services for its citizens, even though for the time being they are em-ployed in military lines. The Government is a business concern, purely secular in its nature. It is not and can not be religious, for religion has to do with the personal relations of the individual toward God. Government is not antireligious, but simply nonreligious, for the good and sufficient reason that true religion is an affair of the heart and life, not of law, either constitutional or statu-tory. The state that undertakes to be re-ligious must become a persecutor. Only the state that professes no religion while it op-poses no religious faith, can guarantee to all its citizens freedom and equality in both the civil and the religious sphere. All history attests the truth of this statement.  Ł    THERE is per-haps no ques-tion which has caused more discussion, and even bloodshed, than the question of sovereignty, and where it ought, by The Right of Sovereignty Where Is It Vested? body of citizens, or their dozen repre-sentatives. The founders of the American Re-public did not be-lieve in the sover-eignty of the state over its citizens to By the Editor         right, to be vested. It has been a long struggle, but great progress has been made in the right direction. The sovereignty of the government of the people has been changed from one man as sov-ereign, to the collective body of the people; and he who was before a subject of the king, is now a citizen of the state. A citizen of a democracy is a freeman, and not a subject, and enjoys an inherent right to partake in the sov-ereign privileges of the administration of the government. In a republic each citizen enjoys equal privileges with every other citizen. No citizen of a democracy enjoys special privileges unless they are delegated to him by the whole the extent of exer-cising absolute authority and power, nor did they believe in the sovereignty of the majority of the people over the minority, or any part thereof, to the extent of exercising tyrannical and absolute power. They believed that each individual, as a responsible moral being, had certain " inalienable " and " natural rights," which neither the state nor the people could rightfully take from him. The Declaration of Independence and the Federal Constitution ex-pressly reserved such rights to each individual citizen, and safeguarded them by very positive limitations. And they particularly guaranteed them by the first ten Amendments to the Con-
