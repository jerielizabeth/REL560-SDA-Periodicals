C., ARKANSAS + + + + -Ł"- N connection with the power and authority of the Post Office Department, + + 4. the most powerful of all our departments for good, I desire to discuss 4. + Tb another matter that is constantly being agitated throughout the country. 4. _,, A couple of bills to amend the postal laws of this country, introduced by f 4. + + Mr. Fitzgerald, of New York, H. R. 6469, and Mr. Siegel, of the same State, + + H. R. 491, seek to increase the power of the Postmaster-General. . . . If there 4. 4. is one guaranty out of which the sacred framework of our country is constituted, + + that guaranty is that every man may worship his Creator as his conscience +4. + directs, without the interference of the state. If this Republic expects to cling + 4. 4 4.. 4. to its pristine principles, that have made it better, freer, and more liberal in giving  + hopes and aspirations to all its people, it must forever keep separate and apart + 4. 4. church and state; and as sacred as is that guaranty that every citizen may wor- + + 4. ship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, just so sacred is that 4. 4. other guaranty by the federal Constitution, the freedom of speech or the press, + 4. 4. that these may be never denied or abridged. Every school boy and girl fifteen +  4. 4Old World in defense of these sacred principles; that rivers have run red with + . 4. the blood of men; that women and children have been butchered and sacrificed + + by the tyranny of those who would restrict the freedom of the press and of speech, : 4, and who undertook to say that people should not worship their Creator the way + + they chose to worship him. 4. +4. I cannot believe, Mr. Speaker, that any religion, race, creed, or fraternal or- + 4. ganization worthy of existence could have that existence threatened by the mere + to the guaranty of the federal and every State constitution? . . . The Federal + f and State constitutions and the laws based upon those constitutions all say that + + no Łcitizen- and "citizen " here means likewise a corporation - shall be deprived 'f'4. + of its property without due process of law. . . . 4. + But here in these two bills the authors undertake to say that because it may + .1. + hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, he shall forthwith cause an investigation + to be made under his direction, and shall, within twenty days after receipt of f 4. + such complaint, if the facts contained therein are true, make an order forbidding + 4* the further use of the mails to any such publication." + + 4. Mr. Speaker, . . . if . . . publications are indecent, immoral, or scurril- 4. +  ous in character, are not the courts of the country open to whatever punish- + +  + ment . . , should be inflicted upon such publishers? If things appear in + + papers and magazines so indecent and obscene that they should not enter our + + homes, do you think, sir, that the courts of the country would not protect our + 4. 4. 4. homes? But these bills arbitrarily turn over to the Postmaster-General the mat- 4. 4. ter of determining, not through an investigation of some court or tribunal, but + as some Postmaster-General of the future may arbitrarily decide.-Congressional f + Record, 4. + IN.ecord, March 7, 3 916, p, 4229. + + + + 4. 4.  + 4. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++4.444.4e+++++++++++++++++ 4. + years of age, who has reached the sixth grade, knows that American shores were + made the asylum to the peoples of the Old World in the early days of our coun- + +4. try's history; that here they came fleeing from the tyra.iny not only of rulers +i, + but the mobs of the old country; that this land of the free, this home of the + f + + brave, might be consecrated to civil and religious liberty, to the freedom of the + 4. printing press and of speech. And if that day should ever come that these sacred + and holy principles shall be overturned,- that the Congress shall step in and by + 4. + + its law trample underfoot these holy and sacred principles for which our fore- + fathers fought and established,- then the end of free government is in sight. 4. . . . No student of history will fail to recall that the blood of martyrs for hun- clreds of years and that millions of people have bitten the dust of death in the 4. publication of some paper in Missouri or some magazine in Georgia or elsewhere. 4. + I think it quite evident that any paper that devotes its whole purpose to any one + + + cause is likely to become extreme and overstate the true position. We may + + concede that: but is that a sufficient reason why any citizen should have his prop- : + 4. erty confiscated, or that he should be deprived of his property, which is forbidden + + by the federal and all State constitutions, without due process of law, according  + be represented to the Postmaster-General that certain publications are being sent 4. through the mails which tend " to expose any race, creed, or religion to either
