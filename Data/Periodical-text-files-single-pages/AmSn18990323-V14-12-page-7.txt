AMERICAN SENTINEL. 183 A Threatened Danger to Our Republic. BY WARREN GRAHAM. THERE exists in human nature such an innate love of liberty that man prefers death to servitude; yet, loving liberty as he does, he is inconsistent enough to take this blessing from his fellowman. He has even had the audacity to place himself above the Almighty, and appoint himself dictator over the consciences of men. From the pages of history we learn that, for refusing to permit their religious opinions to be controlled by an-other, men have been tortured by every method which huinan genius is able to devise. Such scenes were the outgrowth of a union of church and state. The reins of government were seized by unscrupulous individuals. The man of the Vatican had but to speak, and all Europe groaned. It appears that governments formerly existed for the purpose of torturing man, and robbing him of his birthright,Å the right to liberty. After hundreds of years of tyranny, however, men awoke to the fact that their reason had been duped by sentiment. They then founded a government upon the principle "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Cre-ator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government be-comes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and institute a new gov-ernment, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness." Only by the continual recognition of these principles, may a nation hope to endure. While Europe was drenched with blood, thousands, to escape the dungeon and the rack, fled to America, where they in turn became the persecutors. Oppression reigned until the first amendment of our Constitution forbade the making of laws respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. This amendment struck the death blow to the union of church and state, and gave us a century of religious freedom, a blessing unknown in other countries. But the foes of liberty never sleep. Human genius is continually devising methods for the destruction of freedom. The union of church and state, the "A pollyon" of liberty, again threatens to destroy that which has been bought with the blood of patriots. It threatens to set at naught all principles of justice, and revive the tyranny of popery. If the impending danger came in the form of a mighty army, amid the tramp of war steeds, flashing steel, glittering battle blades, rattling muskets, or the roar and thunder of cannon, there would  be little occasion for trembling. America would then give her last drop of blood to preserve her 'freedom. But this is not the foe. The foe of liberty comes as a "thief in the night," and does its deadly work while the sentinels sleep. The devil is up to his old trick of deceiving men. He would make the men of America believe that religion should be forced upon mankind by the civil law. The very same wedge which made the gap through which religion entered the politics of Europe, has been driven into the civil power of America. March 17,321 A. n., Constantine, ruler of the Roman Empire. enacted a law which compelled all men to refrain from labor upon the first day of the week, in order that the day might be spent in worship. This was the first Sunday law which ever existed. It was an attempt to manufacture Christians by compelling men to be hypo-crites. Here was the beginning of the religious persecu-tion which swept like a torrent across the plains of Europe, and converted every valley into a sea of human blood. It was the Sunday law which created the union of church and state; and it was the union of church and state which created the papacy. Such a law will create such a union anywhere; and such a union will create a papacy anywhere. Some are now clamoring for the very same ruinous statute, and in some States it has been put into effect. Within the last five years, in Arkansas, Tennessee, Geor-gia, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, honest men have been robbed of their time, property, and liberty, and have been imprisoned and worked in the chain gang with malefactors and criminals, for no other offense than peaceably pursuing an honorable in-dustry upon certain days which others of the community choose to spend in worship. What kind of a law is that which imprisons a man for supporting his family? What kind of a law is that which makes honest industry a crime, and sets a premium on idleness? "0, Judg-ment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason!" Persecution has sprung up in the very face of a Con-stitution which guarantees to all men religious freedom of conscience. But men are shutting their eyes to the truth, and denying that persecution exists. The ques-tion of enforced Sunday observance has been presented in such a misleading manner that men have been deluded into thinking that such a law is for the good of society. Be not deceived. It was just such a law that of old brought about death dealing persecution. If it will not do the same for America, then surely, "Experience is a cheat, and fact is a liar." Beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing! While our nation is being betrayed by a kiss, the man of the Vatican smiles a fraudful smile, and rejoices as he thinks of the time when his throne shall be established in America. Call not the warning voice an alarmist. It is not the duty of a sentinel to cry " All's well!" when there is something radically wrong. Rather, let us awake to the
