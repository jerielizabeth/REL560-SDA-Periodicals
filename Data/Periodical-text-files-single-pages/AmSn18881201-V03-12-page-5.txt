THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 93 The Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Politics. THE SENTINEL has sometimes been accused of antagonizing the good work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and of turning aside from its legitimate work to fight that bOdy. This charge we most emphatically deny. With the good work of the W. C. T. U., we are most heartily in accord; but just to the extent that it allies itself with so-called National Reform, and belies its name by be-coming a political union, to that extent we are opposed to it. That is, we are opposed to it only when it neglects its own work. But in order that criticism may be turned from us, we publish the following from one of the most talented leaders in the National W. C. T. U. No words of ours have ever equaled it in scathing criticism, although it is justly deserved. The article is from the pen of Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, in the Independent, of No-vember 1:Š Permit a brief recital of the position of ,the W. C. T. U. on the much debated question of politics. The essential elements of religious truth upon which this organization is based are total abstinence, and,  Christian unity in advocating it. The leading characteristics of this movement have been the education of in-dividuals as to personal duty, and the suppres-sion of the traffic in intoxicating liquors by legal enactments. This second phase of the question (work for prohibition) is not an end but a means to an end. This means is, how-ever, so closely related to the end as to be sometimes substituted for it Brought into prominence by reason of more manifest connection with the duties of citizen-ship, the political phases of the question have very largely absorbed the vital forces of the movement. During the last few years an ef-fort has even been made to bend all these forces into the line of party action alone. The doctrine has been boldly announced that effort, unless made by a party, was valueless for good, and all agitation and discussion on these lines has had its bias set in a party mould. A frenzy seems to have possessed the souls of men, and nothing of good or beauty is seen in anything but the work of partisan-ship with all its attendant curses. Doctrines subversive of the duties of citizens have been freely taught, and lessons which logically re-sult in anarchy and discord have been readily set. The most willing students of these les-sons have been the women of the W. C. T. U. Their zeal has outrun that of their brothers; it has had less of knowledge and more of re-ligious fervor, arid consequently been far more dangerous. It has made direct assaults upon the Christian character and political integrity of its own protesting membership, and has weakende its own hold upon the Christian pub-lic. The W. C. T. U. of to-day differs widely from the inspirational movement of the cru-sade or the early years which immediately followed. We do not claim that lines of Christian effort have been abandond. The children are still gathered in the Bands of Hope, and taught the truthŁof total abstinence ; prisons are still visited with words of blessing, anointed with flowers and tears; daughters are still taught the charm of social abstinence, and mothers are admonished of the obligations and the possibilities of the home. In all the forty departments work still goes on, but these all are overshadowed by the turbid smoke of party frenzy, and the malarial mists of party Jesuitism. No woman enjoys the official patronage who publicly antagonizes the political policy of the Union; no evangelist is sent out who is not in sympathy with the party work; no one is indorsed as a national organizer who declares her opposition to this policy. The official organ is a pronounced partisan paper. Like other partisan papers, it reports news and facts so as to make for their side. The paper for the work among foreign-born citi-zens is a party campaign paper during this year. The edition of the Union Signal for State and county fair work was made to bristle with arguments in favor of Prohibition party work. The blight of partisanship is upon every-thing, and women who expect to purify poli-tics lend themselves to insinuations and half statements of truth for party effect as readily as the veriest demagogues in the old political parties which they condemn. This course has driven the women to great inconsistencies and many illogical positions. They talk about opposing " sweet reasonable-ness to severe epithet;" they make "gentle and dignified denial of any wrong intent to-ward any of our number," and then proceed to adopt with applause, charges (evidence of which is withheld) against the personal in-tegrity of a sister whom they profess to love and honor. They formally declare the most slanderous insinuations of their willing press to, be characterized by "Christian courtesy." Their president commended to her followers as " spicy reading," an open letter containing a most brutal attack upon a Christian minis-ter, and which also contained insinuations against the character of a "beloved sister." Against such treatment there is no redress, since the code of Christian courtesy has swept away the ancient rule, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. They indulge in tumultuous applause at the name and presence of third-party candi-dates, but their president declares that sooner than support Warner Miller in his present candidacy in New York, " Let the minions of that accursed business (saloon) elect their candidates and so fill up the measure of their wrath." To-day those same minions know that the influence of this Christian organiza-tion in the vital issues to be 'settled on No-vember 6 will strengthen the opposition to the man who has answered the challenge of the saloons by saying he preferred defeat to success due to saloon influence. The question is often asked: "Is not the minority as intensely partisan as the majority ?  Is not Mrs. Foster, an active Republican, as earnest in her platform advocacy of Republi-can doctrines, and as trusted in the counsels of party managers, and as responsible for Re-publican methods in dealing with the temper_ ance question, as is Miss Willard for the third party?" To this we reply : " Mrs. Foster is earnest in her belief and advocacy of Republicanism; possibly as trusted in the temperance counsels of Republicans, and she willingly shares the responsibility of the general trend of Repub-licanism on the temperance question. The difference between her position and that of Miss Willard is, that her Republican party work is done as an individual; she does not attempt to coerce the opinion or the influence of the organization to these party ends." Miss Willard does, in her official capacity, support the third party; she goes in person to local conventions, and pleads for this party alliance; she gives official approbation to representation of the W. C. T. U. in third party political conventions; she is herself, by vote of the Na-tional W. C. T. U. Convention, a "consulting member" of the National Prohibition Com-mittee; she uses the platform of the W. C. T. U. Convention in personal advocacy of the third party and its candidates; she herself introduces these gentlemen as the candidates of " our party." This Mrs. Foster has never done. In Iowa, where the Republican party has warranted the largest approbation of tem-perance women, and where, if anywhere, the society would be justified in promising alle-giance, there the W. C. T. U. has never given it; and Mrs. Foster has time and again de-clared it never could be done with her ap-proval. To fail to see the difference between official action and individual action, reveals a lament-able condition of mental or moral obloquy. In the conflicts of modern civilization it ar-gues pitiful imbecility not to possess political convictions, and it argues mental or moral cowardice not to advocate them. This is as true of women as of men, but the political immorality of the National Woman's Chris-tian Temperance Union consists in its appro-priation of the political influence of the minority against their protest. That influence was given to the organization to keep and to use, but not to assign to any political party. In civil courts to obtain money under false pretenses is " embezzlement," and to divert funds from their assigned.  and constitutional uses is "fraud." This is what the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has done; the difference in honor being in favor of the em-bezzler; the grand larceny committed by this Christian organization being of heart and soul and home " influence," while the embezzler merely steals material value. ŁI Ł 6. IN the time of the Woman's Temperance Crusade, through the prayers and Christian fortitude of these brave, devout women, there were reported 'scores of genuine conversions to Christ. We should like very much to see a report of the number of conversions effected through the political workings of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
