IT is the age of gold; but we seem as far as ever from the golden age. IT is more dangerous to adhere to an evil principle than to a wicked person. IF the world could be reformed by law, God would have reformed it long ago. *40- .--44.4  A NATION of slavesŠslaves to that which debases manhoodŠcannot hope to maintain its independence. vor - -44‚ HE who cannot enter into the true spirit of Sabbath-keeping can find no rest nor benefit in it.
