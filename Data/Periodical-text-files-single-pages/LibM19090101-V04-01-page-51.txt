True Protestant Principles HE principles which had led the Protestants to sever themselves from the Roman Church, should have taught them to bear with the opin- ions of others, and warned them from the attempt to connect agreement in doctrine or manner of worship with the necessary forms of civil government. Still less ought they to have enforced that agree-ment by civil penalties; for faith, upon their own showing, had no value save when it was freely given. A church which does not claim to be infallible is bound to allow that some part of the truth may possibly be with its adversaries; a church which permits or encourages human reason to ap-ply itself to revelation has no right first to argue with people, and then to.  punish them if they are not convinced.  From "The Holy Roman Empire," by James Bryce, Chap. 18, Par. 8. 527
