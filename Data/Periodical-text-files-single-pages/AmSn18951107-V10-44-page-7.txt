BIBLES 3 Ł NOVEMBER 7, 1895. A.10/111-41EtIC_A_N SIYJN-irr 351 needs that very time to support the family dependent upon him. Who can say that this is not a matter of conscience ? No wonder the apostle has told us that he that is oblivi-ous to this duty has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel, no matter what his Christian profession may be. Man's first duty is to love God and thus keep the first four precepts of the Decalogue, but the command to love and care for fellow-beings is second only to this first command, and conscience requires it. Ł -4. Ł HAVE CHANGED THEIR MINDS. THE following from the Chicago Tribune, of October 28, illustrates some of the beauties of enforced Sunday rest:Š John Williams, No. 245 Sixty-third street, engaged a friend to move his household effects, and at 9 o'clock yesterday morning the work began. When the wagon was partly loaded an Englewood man going to church saw it and made complaint at the police station. An officer was sent to the house with instructions to the family not to move. When the officer went away the work of loading the wagon continued, and again the police were requested to stop it. The man who owns the Wagon said if they would not let him move the family because it was wrong to move on Sunday or do any work, he could not see his way to-wards unloading the wagon. The police did not want the street obstructed all night, and the men who wanted to stop the moving did not want to he held responsible for any damage that might fall on the goods if they were left on Sixty-third street until Monday. That was the status of the case when Police Sergeant Lillis told the man he might move, and at four o'clock in the afternoon, after wrangling all day, the teamster drove off with the goods. The "law" of Illinois provides that the section prohibiting ordinary labor on Sunday, "shall not be construed to prevent . . . ferrymen from carrying over the wafer trav-elers and persons moving their families on the first day of the week." It does not in so many words provide that persons shall be per-mitted to travel, or that it is lawful for fam-ilies to move upon that day, but the presump-tion is that both things may be done, else why permit ferrymen to transport them over the water? It seems that this is the view that is taken of it by the police authorities of Chi-cago, for they only objected to the loading of the goods. It is simply another illustration of the absurdity of Sunday laws. THE purpose of human government being to preserve human rights, it cannot go beyond that. And that this is the sole purpose for which God ordained civil government among men is evident from the fact that had he or-dained it for any other purpose, he would thereby have abdicated the throne of moral sovereignty. Had God permitted men to de-fine and enforce duty toward him, he would by that very act have committed to men not only the custody but the modeling of his law, and moral duty, would then have been whatever government declared it to be; and the varying moral codes adopted by men must in such a case have been not only the rule of human conduct, but the divine rule of the divine judgment. THE Sabbath is not merely one-seventh part of time devoted to rest because of man's phys-ical necessities, but it is a specific portion of time set apart by the Lord himself to keep him in mind as the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and as' a' sanctifier of his people.

Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The " Fathers of the Catholic Church " shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the stand-ard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new form of paganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.
