TO THE PUBLIC: This certifies that the Battle Creek Sanitarium -Health Foods, manufactured by the Sanitarium under the name of the Sanitarium Food Company, are made under my direction and supervision, and that Granola and the other special foods manufactured by this company, are not made or sold by any other firm or person except their duly authorized agents. J. H. KELLOG, M. D. Our goods are shipped to every part of the worldŠto Australia, New Zealand, India, Persia, and other foreign countries, as well as to all parts of the United States; and in every instance they have demonstrated their wonderful keeping properties. The following are a few of the hundreds of testimonials received from persur:s who have for years made use of our foods. MICHIGAN. I have for three years used the " Health Foods" in my family, and can heartily recommend them, both for purity and health- giving properties. C. F. PORTER, D. D. S. INDIANA. Your " Health Foods " are the wonder of the nineteenth century. I have used Granola but a short time, but have already experienced relief from indigestion and acid, or flatulent dyspepsia.. I also find the Zwiebach nourishing and toothsome. D. M. KAUFFMAN. I have pers :flatly tested your excellent food known as Granola. It is highly pleasing to the taste, easy of digestion, and the most nutritive cereal production with which I am acquainted. DR. R. W. BULA. NEW YORK. Your Granola is the best selling invalid food I have ever handled. I have already sold nearly two thousand pounds. A. J. BROUGHTON. CONNECTICUT. We have used your "Health Foods" in our family for three years, and can not get along without them. Having been troubled with dyspepsia and chronic inflammation of the stomach, I find that your Granola, Avenola, Wheatena, and Gluten are the only foods that I can eat with safety. WM. M. MERWIN. OHIO. Our baby is a testimonial to Sanitarium food. She is ten months old, weighs twenty-eight pounds, and is as ruddy and healthy a specimen as can be seen. She has actually gained flesh while cutting her last two teeth. Her flesh is firm and sound, and she is very strong. FRED. L. ROSEMOND. MINNESOTA. We have twins, and the little fellows are thriving nicely. The food agrees with them perfectly, and I have recommended k to many who are bringing up babies " by hand." D. W. McCoys'''. NOVEMBER 30, 1893. A_NIIMEtICA,N 375                   alists, the American Missionary Associa-tion has entirely withdrawn. The appro-priation is for the independent Ramona school and perhaps one other. Last year the Episcopalians reduced their claims on the Government from $23,220 to $4,860, but for the year ending June 30th, 1894, they have increased the figures to $7,020. The Friends still take $10,020, the Men-nonites $3,750, the Unitarians $5,400, and the Lutherans $15,120. Ł . . The amount assigned for the Protestant denominations sums up $80, 350 against $365,045 assigned to Catholic schools. Ł Ł  A VEST-POCKET DICTIONARY has become a necessity in this age of activity, and among the many that have appeared, "The Complete Vest-Pocket Library," just out, stands in our judgment pre6minent, in that while it is no larger than the average of such books, and of convenient size to carry in the vest-pocket, it gives, besides, other useful information, the correct spelling and pronunciation of 45,863 words, or about twice as many as any similar work. As its name indicates, "The Complete Vest-Pocket Library" is much more than a dictionary. It contains (1) " The Colum-bian Word Builder," a very simple and yet exceedingly useful device which more than doubles the capacity of the dictionary; (2) ".Guide to Pronunciation;" (3) "Avery full List of Abbreviations ; " (4) "The Co-lumbian Pronouncing Dictionary and Speller," 135 pages ; (5) " The Columbian Pronouncing and Statistical Gazetteer of the World; " (6) " The Columbian Digest of Parliamentary Practice ; " (7) "The Co-lumbian Rapid Calculator, and Compend of Business and Social Forms;" (8) "The Co-lumbian Perpetual Memorandum, Stamp book and Three Years' Calendar; " (9) "Ta-bles of Weights and Measures." The whole forms a book only 51 by 2f inches and only * of an inch thick. We can most unhesitatingly recommend "The Complete Vest-Pocket Library " as a most useful companion; and it would make  a very appropriate and acceptable birthday or holiday present.
