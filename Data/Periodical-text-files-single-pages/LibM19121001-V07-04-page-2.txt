" The powers that be are ordained of God." 1. The Bible is the Word of God, and Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world. z. The ten commandments are the foundation of all morality, and comprehend the whole duty of man, both to God and to man. 3. The religion of Jesus Christ, being founded in the love of God, needs no human power to support or enforce it. Love can not be forced. 4. It is the right, and should be the privilege, of every individual to worship, or not to worship, according to the dictates of his own conscience, provide] that in the exercise of that right he does not interfere with the equal rights of others. 5. Civil government is of divine origin, designed for the protection of men in the enjoyment of their natural rights. It is ordained to rule in civil things, and in this realm is entitled to the respectful obedience of all. 6. The civil power is not authorized to enter the realm of religion, enacting legislation to define or to enforce any religious dogma, ritual, or observance. Co-ercion in matters of religion always means persecution. 7. All religious legislation on the part of the state, and all movements tending to unite and state, are subversive of human rights, persecuting in character, and opposed to the best interests of both church z nd state. 8. It is proper, therefore, for all to protest against, and use every laudable and legitimate means to prevent, religious legislation, or the union of church and state, in order that all may enjoy the inestimable blessings of religious liberty. 9. The warfare of modern science and modern theology upon the Word of God is a warfare upon the liberties of men, which are defined and guaranteed by that Word. o. The liquor traffic is a curse to the home, to society, and to the nation, and a menace to civil order, and should be prohibited by law.
