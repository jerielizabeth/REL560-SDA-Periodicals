rr ft{ 11_, S OF THE CATH.91.1,CwARIRCH. History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church " shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the stand-ard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new form of paganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.

They are a thrifty and law-abiding people. They hold their religious services and preach their doctrines the same as other religious de-nominations. Many of us do not believe in their creed, but we do not seek to controvert it by resorting to the legislatures and courts. In fact, we simply permit them to worship when and where they will, only claiming the same privilege ourselves. If they wish to hoe in the garden on Sunday there are none to say them nay. The premises are theirs, and why should they not if they choose? This is as it should be. Let them worship when they will and if they choose to keep the seventh day instead, of the first, let them do so, for in these matters certainly we are not our brother's keeper.
