Phi ladelphiaSunday=Enforcement Crusade Halted PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR Sentinel CHRISTIAN LIBERTY OF Th VOL. XIX WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 28, 1904 NO. 4 "Reverence for aqprie law " as such is no proper object of civil law and its enforcement. " The moral sense is outraged by the spectacle of an offender charged before a court `with a crime which he has been tempted to commit by the witness against him." " The morals of a city are not likely much to be bene-fited by an association which solicits to, provokes, and shares in, a series of offenses against a lib, which it e. ists to enforce." The only vicious and demoralizing violation of the Sunday law that has come to light in the whole course of the Philadelphia Sunday-enforcement crusade has been the habitual 'Notation of that lark, by the agents of the Phila-delphia " Sabbath " Association in the work of prosecuting the crusade. The Nolation of the law by the poor shop- keepers was respectable and honorable; the violation by the representata,es of the "Sabbath " Association 'Ivas mean and contemptible. " There is a higher law than the blue laws now being enforced in Philadelphia. There is allrays some mean, sordid motive behind the enforcement of these obsolete laws. It may be a pretense of piety, or something else, but always there is tn it some motive that is mean. The legislature should repeal these laws at the next session. ( IT IS ALWAYS GOOD LEGISLATION TO REPEAL OBNOXIOUS MEASURES AND ENACT BETTER ONES in harmony with the spirit of the times. "Šsee p. 61. PUBLICATION OFFICE : 222 NORTH CAPITOL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.
