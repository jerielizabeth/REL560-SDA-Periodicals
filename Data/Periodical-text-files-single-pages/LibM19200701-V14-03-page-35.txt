SUGGESTED BY PENDING SUNDAY BILL Notwithstanding the prohibition of the First Amendment to the Constitution,Š" Congress shall make no law respecting an establish-ment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"Š a persis-tent and long-continued effort has been made by a large number of misguided religionists in this country to secure some kind of positive Sunday legislation from the lawmaking body of the nation. The po-litical boycott has been freely threatened, and in some cases actually invoked, but so far Congress has not enacted any positive law of the character sought. A new bill, one of the most drastic ever offered, is now before the national legislature. Will members of Congress be governed by the same principles and apply the same logic to this question which were so ably used in defense of the freedom of the press? or will they deny to one part of the First Amendment the same broad application given to that part which guarantees free press and free speech? We shall see.
