1917, some thought it must be just what they claimed for it,Å  merely a labor measure to give the barbers, the butch- ers, and the grocers a day of rest. The nature of an evil is not changed, however, by a change of its supporters. Sunday as a day of rest had its origin in religious dogma, and to compel its observance is to enforce a religious doctrine, whether it be done by a preacher or by some one who was never even suspected of having any religion. A law is not needed to enable the barbers and others to close their places of business on Sunday. They can close on Sunday now if they choose to do so.

No " preachers " appeared at any time to speak for the bill, although i t s Sunday-rest features were al-most identical with the measure advocated by re-ligious teachers in 1914, which was defeated by a vote of the people by a majority of 167,211. Judging by the class of people appearing as proponents of this latest advocating the Sunday-rest bill to pass Sunday bill, that of the present year, it in the assembly, even if the party were 85 THE CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL
