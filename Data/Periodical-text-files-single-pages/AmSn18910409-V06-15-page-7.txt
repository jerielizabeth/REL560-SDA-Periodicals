SIBERIA AND THE NIHILISTS WHY KENNAN WENT TO SIBERIA. By William Jackson Armstrong, (Late Inspector General of United States Consulates.) This is one of the most intensely interesting and thoroughly reliable con-tributions to literature on Russia and the Nihilists ever published. It comprises Mr. Armstrong's famous lecture on " Siberia and the Nihilists" (delivered first in Cooper Union, New York, and afterwards by special request of many eminent men in Lincoln Hall, Washington), together with some exceedingly interesting letters and newspaper criticisms from the pens of the author and George Kerman, the Siberian traveller. EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, because no one can be intelligent upon the subject of which it treats without familiarity with its contents. Besides, the book is a powerful stimulus to that love of liberty so essential to the maintenance of free Government. It contains some pqinted and caustic criticisms upon Mr. Kennan's defense of the Russian Government after his first visit to that country, and explains WHY KENNAN WENT TO SIBERIA the second time. The Century articles which were the result of that visit fully justify the position taken, and the statements made by Mr. Armstrong in 1883: 160 PAGES, PAPER COVERS, PRICE 25 cents.

"It is a searching book. "ŠChristian, Intelligeneer. " This is a wonderful book. At whatever page you open it, your eye lights upon pithy aphorisrhs that combine the sententiousness of Benjamin Franklin, with the sweet, holy savor of Samuel Rutherford. It contains hundreds of bright seed thoughts."ŠRev. T. L. Cuyler, D. D. Address, PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 43 BOND. STREET, NEW YORK CITY. or, Oakland, Cal. Sacred Chronology, BY SYLVESTER BLISS. Tins work treats of the Elements of Chronol-ogy, the different systems, and the various eras, and gives the chronology of the principal events recorded in Sacred History from the Creation till the death of St. John. It also contains a vindica-tion of the numbers of the Hebrew Scriptures. As an aid to investigation it is invaluable. The book has been thoroughly revised, and an entire chapter added, on the PEOPLING OF THE EARTH. This chapter is an exposition of the tenth chap-ter of Genesis, and gives an outline of the beginning of History and THE ORIGIN OF NATIONS. New and valuable notes have been added to the original text of the book, making it the most val-uable work on the subject of sacred chronology extant. No student of history can well do without it. It contains a vast amount of infor-mation in small space, and so far from being dry it is as interesting as a story, which it reallyis.

IS THE PAPACY IN PROPHECY? BY THE Rev. Thomas W. Haskins, M. A., Rector Christ Church, Los Angeles. Cal. The above is the title of a treatise written by the author at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a dis-cussion upon the present aspect and aims of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as th- Papacy, or Vaticanism, is outlined in the prophecies of Holy Scriptures with sufficient accuracy to determine what the "Papacy" is, and what is to be its future devel-opment and ultimate end.
