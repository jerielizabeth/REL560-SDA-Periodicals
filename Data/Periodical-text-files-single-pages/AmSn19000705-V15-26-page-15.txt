It contains the history of the two systems of education, Pagan and Christian. The cause of the failure and apostasy of Israel, the early church, the Reformers, and modern Protestants, also the weak-ness of the remnant church, can be traced to no other source, and accounted for on no other grounds than the Pagan methods and wrong principles of education instilled into the minds and hearts of the children and youth of past ages and the present generation. Would you know and understand the true principles of Christian Education for to-day? Secure at once a copy of "Liv-ing Fountains or Broken Cisterns, an Educational Problem for Protestants."

I have read the MS. of Prof. E. A. Sutherland's new book, "Living Fountains or Broken Cisterns, an Educational Prob-lem for Protestants," and I am convinced that it is the book for our churches and our schools. Everyone who reads the book must be convinced that there are now two systems of education ; one Christian and the other Pagan. The one leading to the knowledge of God and the other to doubt and infidelity. L. A. HOOPES— Sec. Gen. Conf. SEND YOUR ORDERS TO THE REVIEW AND HERALD PUB. CO., 331k-xrivn cren /VII 11. TORONTO, Oat.
