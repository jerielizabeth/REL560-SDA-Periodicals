Lilly Pond, Winona Lake, Ind qica≈Å LIBERTY Against the Government National Reformism, as Self-Expounded in Annual Convention, Declares Its Pur- pose to Revoke the National Con- stitution and Overturn the Entire Foundation of the Government THE EDITOR ONE of the most persistent opponents of the American idea of government and the American form of government is the National Reform Association, which  declared in the exact words. They pro-fessed opposition to a union of church and state; but plainly declared their pur-pose to establish a religious state, a na-tional religion, a theocracy. To those uninitiated into the mysterious mazes of the reasoning there used, it was impos-sible to determine where the distinction lay hidden. The first address given contained an attack upon the national Constitution be-cause it did not contain the name of held its annual convention, or institute, at Winona Lake, Ind., from August 9 to 20. The institute was in charge of Rev. J. S. Martin, general superintend-ent of the association, and prominent officers of the association were present to expound its doctrines and purposes. The general theme of the institute was the re-formation of this nation along National Reform lines, its transforma-tion into a theocracy, and the enthrone-ment of Christ as its ruler. Through every address ran that thread, not hinted at, nor inferentially deduced, but plainly  LILY POND, \VINOD God, Creator, or Jesus Christ. " That omission," said Dr. J. S. McGaw, " has told tremendously on the religious tone of the civil life of the nation ever since. It has mightily assisted in the prevalence of the secular theory of civil govern-ment, and has made possible the exist-ence of the legalized sins of our day. The call of the hour is for a nation-wide revival of our national religion, that the nation may be brought to the feet of Christ in repentance, and may openly acknowledge him as her King. America must be brought to Christ. . . . America
