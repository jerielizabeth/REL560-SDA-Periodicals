SUNDAY ENFORCEMENT This department is designed to record what is being done throughout the United States and elsewhere in the way of Sunday enforcement. Necessarily the items in most instances must be a barerreciral of the facts. The principles involved are discussed in the general articles and the editorial department. An ordinance prohibiting theatrical en-tertainments on Sunday was adopted "by unanimous vote" of the city council of Mitchell, S. Dak., on December 27. O At a meeting in the Masonic Temple on the evening of December 17 the recently organized Grocers' and Butchers' Asso-ciation in Chicago "declared in favor of Sunday closing of stores." A dispatch from Deadwood,. S. Dak., under date of December 25, stated that "in response to pressure from the labor unions the merchants have agreed to close their stores on Sunday's and holidays." ≈Å A dry-goods clerk was fined $5 "for violating the Sunday law" in the Harlem police court, New York City, on Decem-ber 22. Another prisoner held on the same charge was discharged, the magis-trate saying it was "evidently a spite arrest." 4. A barber at the St. Charles Hotel in Hamilton, Ohio, was arrested on Decem-ber 23 "on a charge of shaving a man on Sunday." He "was put under $2oo bond for hearing by Squire Egry."
