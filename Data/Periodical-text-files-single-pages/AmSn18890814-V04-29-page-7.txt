Man''', The Teachers' Outlook. Published by The Teachers' Publishing Company, Des Moines, Iowa. A monthly magazine for teach-ers and pupils that proposes to supplement other School Journals rather than to occupy the same field. It will seek to provide an OUTLOOK upon af-fairs of life and facts In science and nature which illustrate and test theories; to stimulate thought, and give the teacher's mind a fresh source of in-spiration. A review of current events, civil and industrial problems, inven tors, discoveries, etc., will be an im-portant feature of the magazine, and a complete review of current literature will also be given by competent critics. ANOTHER AND VERY TM PORTANT FEATURE of the magazine will be that all teachers and students are invited to Join its circle of writers, out of which it proposes to draw its corps of future contributors. On this point it has some original plans of mut-ual helpfulness to carry out. WANTED, ESPECIALLYŠWriters of short, realistic stories, and articles on natural history and social science, from the Pacific Coast. Terms given in OUTLOOK. Sample copies 20 eta. None free. Civil Government and Religion. BY A. T. JONES, One of the Editors of the AmEnicaor Scriptu ral, Logical, Plain and Forcible. This important work shows clearly the relation that should exist between Church and State at the present time, as proven by the Bible and his-tory of the past twenty-five centuries. " CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION" Is a pamphlet of 176 large octavo pages. Price 25 cents. Millions of copies should be placed in the hands of thinking people AT ONCE. It clearly de-fines what position we, as American citizens, should sustain toward the effort now on foot to se-cure religious legislation.

Read what Others Say of it:  "Many books have been written about the glorious and wondrous story of the Sierras. But it seems to me that this scholarly and venerable pioneer, who was publishing an illustrated magazine devoted largely to the themes he celebrates, when many of the younger authors were still at their nurse's knee, is the one man who is entitled, by his culture, his fine tastes, and, above all, his long and wonderful experience, to write the one great and responsible authority about the Heart of the Sierras."ŠJa.4 QUIN MILLER, the Noted Author and Correspondent. "The illustrations, the text, the whole atmosphere of the volume, are worthy of their great subject, the Yo SemiteŠand what could I say more? "ŠREV. JOSEPH COOK, of Boston. "It is a truthful, interesting, and instructive work."ŠGA LEN CLARK, Yo Semite Valley. (For sixteen years the Valley's Guardian.) "As might have been expected, Mr. Hutchings' story of the Valley that he knows and loves so well, is no cold description, but reads with all the charms of a romance."ŠSan Francisco Hotel Gazette. "Those who have not seen Yo Semite cannot do better, short of going to the Valley, than by purchasing Mr. Hutchings' handsome volume."ŠThe Sacramento Record-Union.
