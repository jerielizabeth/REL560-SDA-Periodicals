Does man require more coercion to take his necessary rest from labor than what the law of nature has imposed? ŠSee page numbered 148. It is the chief end and object of civil government to restrain its constituents from doing wrong or injury to each other, and to protect  all alike in the enjoyment of their nat-ural and inalienable right  to exercise the virtue of useful industry, and to rest and take innocent recreation when nature or their comfort or their pleasure may require it. Ł But laws for the object last mentioned would be, from their very nature and occasion, OBLIGATORY ONLY ON THOSE WHOSE AGGRESSIVE CONDUCT THEY WOULD BE INTENDED TO RESTRAIN, leaving all others to do useful labor or to take  rest or innocent.recre-ation. ŠSee page numbered 150. Honest, useful industry is ranked among the virtues, and innocent recreation is harmless amusement, and neither can injure any one. While either or both are pursued without injuring or disturbing others in their right to work or rest, they are not evil or immoral acts, and do not fall within the objects of civil government, and THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO RIGHT TO INTERDICT THEM.
