A POLITICAL HISTORY Of the great questions culminating in The CIVIL WAR in the words of ABRAHAM, LINCOLN and STEPHEN A. DOUGLASS. 555 Pages. Cloth $1.75. The work is entitle(1 "Political Debates and Speeches of Lincoln and Douglas," and contains a complete re-port of their speeches and debates. The burning words of these great orators are of absorbing inter-est both to those who have lived through the exciting scenes pictured out, and those who know them merely as history. There can be nothing better placed in the hands of the rising generation than a book presenting, in an attractive way, the principles on which this government is founded. Efforts are now being made to overthrow those principles, hence it is important that we become intelligent regarding them. The work is a great assist-ance to that end. Agents Wanted Everywhere.
