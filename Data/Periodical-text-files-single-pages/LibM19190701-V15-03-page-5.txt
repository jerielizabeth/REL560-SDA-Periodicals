XIV THIRD QUARTER, 1919 NO. 3 Kt- THE world's greatest menace today is not war nor famine nor plague, but all of these combined, and more, in what is known as Bolshevism. And what is Bolshevism? It is radical So-cialism, not in theory, but in actual operation. " Bolshevism " is an Anglicized Russian word, derived from bolsheviki, meaning the majority. Bolshevism in part is therefore the good Ameri-can doctrine that the majority ought to rule in all purely civil matters. But Bolshevism is more than the doctrine of rule by the majority. Bolshevism teaches that as the proletariat, or the whole body of the working people, constitute the majority in every land, the working class ought to control the government, not only by outvoting all other classes, but by eliminating them altogether; so that instead of having a lower class, a middle class, and an upper class making up human society, there would be but one class, namely, the proletarian, or working, class. .,,,,,ŁŁŁ -. 4 - ...., - 1.4 Ł.: Ł ^ -- It  iI*  ŁŁŁ' ,...,...,.— . ....., Ł ...., .Ł Ł , .
