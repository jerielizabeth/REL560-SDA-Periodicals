  ..IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, / JUDGE HIM NOT: FOR I CAME NOT TO JUDGE THE WORLD, BUT TO SAYE THE WORLD."   Vol. 11, No. 37. NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 17, 1896. Price, Three Cents.

THE cartoon which we print on the second page of this paper, by permission of the Truth Seeker, is a forcible illustration of how infi-delity is fostered by the inconsistencies of so-called Christianity. The persecution so forcibly depicted in this cartoon is utterly abhorrent to Christianity, even as it is to the innate sense of justice, im- planted the human soul by the Creator, which kia'as the editor of the Truth Seeker to cry out against it. Believing this, we are more sorry than we can tell that candid ag-nostics everywhere do not look away from the false to the true; that turning away from the imperfections of men they do not discover the divine perfections of the Lord Jesus Christ, that beholding Him they might be changed into the same image. All men admire the character of Christ, as depicted in the gospels; but so little of that character appears in the lives of many of his professed followers that multitudes regard his perfections as only beautiful ideals quite beyond the reach of mankind; hence they think Christianity is impractical and even injurious, since it neglects the attainable for the unattainable, and fosters hypocrisy by leading men to make a profession, not only beyond their attainments, but beyond any possibility of attainment. The trouble is that men are too prone to judge Christianity, not by the teachings of Christ, but by the lives of those who profess it; not by the best types produced by it, but by the poorest; not by the genuine, but by the pseudo. But this is illogical. What would be thought of a man or a set of men who would judge of a system of medicine solely by the success of the poorest type of physicians who professed to practice it, with-out first inquiring as to the best results at-tained by the ablest and best practitioners, and without examining the system itself and comparing the practice with the rules of the  system as laid down by its founder, to see whether it was faithfully followed or not? Certainly all must see that the same rule ought to apply in both cases. A system of medicine ought to be judged, not by the profession of its disciples, but by the practice and rules of its founder; not by the worst results of the professed practice of the sys-tem, but by the best results of its exact and conscientious practice as laid down by its author. In like manner Christianity should be judged by what it is, not by what it is not. Unbelievers do not point the finger of scorn at the Founder of Christianity. They do not, as a rule, assail the system itself as laid down by the Lord Jesus Christ. They do not even impeach the characters of the best representatives of Christianity, such as Bun-yn, Baxter, Wesley, White held, Judson, and a host of others who might be named; but they judge the system by the poorest types, the quacks and impostors, so to speak, of the Christian profession. When persecution arises, as it always has arisen, instead of attributing it to the natural intolerance of the human heart, to the selfish-ness of human nature unrenewed by divine grace, men too often charge it up against Christianity. But Christianity does not teach persecution. Christ is the author of Chris-tianity, and he himself denounced persecu-tion. Upon one occasion when he had set his face to go to. Jerusalem, " he sent mes-sengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. And they did not re-ceive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. And when his disci-ples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them." And this which we have quoted is in har-mony with the whole tenor of the gospel. " God is love,"' and the gospel is the means by which he saves men. Says the apostle, " I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to Luke": 52-56. 2  John 4: S. every one that believeth."' " God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."'  As " God is love," so his law is a law of love; and instead of being responsible for the hatred and selfishness of his creatures, he commands them to love one another, and to do as they would be done by. But this rule is most grossly violated by persecution, as our infidel friends well know. How then can they consistently charge it to the religion of Him who said : " All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets " ? Just at present there are no Seventh-day Adventists in prison or -in-the-ehanwirr --Tennessee. Three Adventists were impris-oned for twenty days each in Lake County the latter part of July and the first days of August. Balls and chains were actually pro-vided in anticipation of compelling these men to work on the public roads, but for some reason the full measure of the proposed in-dignity was not meted out to them. But in other counties in that State Adventists have been required to work, not actually in chains themselves, but in the chain-gang with vicious criminals, while armed guards stood over them, as shown in the cartoon. And the spirit of persecution is still abroad in the land, as is shown by the fact that an-other honest, Christian man is, as our readers know, under indictment in Rutherford Coun-ty, Tenn., for exercising his constitutional and God-given rights in the matter of Sabbath observance. This man will be tried in Octo-ber, and may be compelled to work just as represented in the Truth Seeker's cartoon. But should this be the case or should any number of Seventh-day Adventists be sen-tenced to prisons and to chain-gangs, let not the wrong be attributed to Christianity, but rather to the lack of it, or to such a perver-sion of it as amounts to a practical denial of the second great commandment, " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." " INTELLIGENCE and liberty are not a hin-drance but a help to religious life." Rom. 1:16. 4  John 3: 16.
