 "IF ANY IRAN HEAR bIY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HER NOT."ŠJesus Christ.   VoL. 13, No. 16. NEW YORK, APRIL 21, 1898. Single copy 3 cents.        The American Sentinel is published in the interests of religious libertyŠChristian and Constitutional. ilfir Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it stay know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore those who have, not ordered the Sentinel need have no tears that they will be asked to pay for it (Entered at the New York Post-office.) ONLY the power of God can enforce the law of God. THE law of man lays hold on the sinner; but the gos-pel lays hold on the sin. .1IP  Ł Ł44  THERE is no consistency in taking your religion from one source, and your politics from another. AN effort to force the world to conform to the church always results in conforming the church to the world. WHAT the church needs to-day is not Sunday laws, but something to separate her more clearly from the world. THE effectiveness of human law depends altogether upon public sentiment. The effectiveness of the divine law is altogether independent of public sentiment. IT is better for the worldly man to be engaged in hon-est work!on the Sabbath, or in innocent recreation, than to be going through the forms of Sabbath-keeping. IF the apostles had turned from the preaching of re-form through faith in Christ, to the preaching of politi-cal or legislative reforms, the world would have been sunk in evil long ago. .11, -414 THE mightiest power in the universe is the power of God; and the mightiest manifestation of God's power is  in the gospel. The gospel is the power of God against sin; and that power alone can overcome the evil that is in the world. IT is better to lean upon God than upon a Sunday law. He who leans upon God does not need any other support; and he who does not lean upon God will fall in spite of all the support that religious _legislation can furnish. 1,-Ł-Ł11 IT is entirely useless for Christians to try to compel the world, by the force of law, to act in an unworldly manner. The unregenerate person must act out the nature that he has, until by the grace of God he is given another and better one. A Groundless Apprehension. A NEW ORLEANS paper makes note of an effort made during the Louisiana Constitutional Convention just closed, to eliminate from the Constitution the recogni-tion of Sunday as a sacred day, and calls it "an outra-geous proposition." It would be a terrible thing, in its view, if the restraints of the Sunday laws were removed, and people permitted to engage in worldly occupations on that day as on any other. It is quite natural for religious people in states which have long maintained a Sunday law to hold this view, even though, as in New Orleans, the law has long been practically a dead letter. It seems to them that the re-moval of such a laW' would be the opening of the flood-gates of secularism, which would result in sweeping away the Sabbath altogether. But really, there is no founda-tion at all for this apprehension. It may be that the removal of Sunday laws would result in an increase of Sunday business and of Sunday amusements. Very well, we say; suppose that it does. If people want to be worldly on the Sabbath (which how-ever is not Sunday), if that is their nature and desire, let them be so. Let the world conduct itself after the man-
