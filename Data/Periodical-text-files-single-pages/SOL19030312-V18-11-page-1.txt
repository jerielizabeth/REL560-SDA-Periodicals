XVIII NEW YORK, MARCH 12, 1903 A.O. 11         At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying. Who is the greatest in the kingdom of he.aben? And he saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all. And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said: 'Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. See Matt. 18:1-4 and Mark 9:35. Be not ye called Rabbi, for One is your Master, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon earth, for One is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters, for One is your Master. He that is greatest among you shall be your servant; and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall humble him- self shall be exalted. See Ma ft. 23:8-12. Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise do-minion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them; but it shall not be so among you. Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to grie his life a ransom for many.
