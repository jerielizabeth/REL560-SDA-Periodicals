EDITORIAL 769 the same circumstances, is not on Wed-nesday a violation of the rights of others, cannot be such a violation on Sunday. The Rumor Denied" wit/Authority" THE action of the Wisconsin Method-ist Conference in sending a communica-tion to President Roosevelt relative to the report that he had asked the Pope to make Archbishop Ireland a cardinal. called forth a denial of some warmth from The Independent, which seems to act as the special champion and defend-er of both the Government and the Pa-pacy in matters of this character. And in so far as such championship is exercised in the interests of ≈Å fairness and truth, it is of course perfectly proper and com-mendable. In its issues of September 25 and Oc-tober 9 The Independent declared "with authority" that "there is no truth in the report that President Roosevelt has asked the Pope to create Archbishop Ireland a cardinal ;" that "President Roosevelt has offered no such impertinent intimation to the ecclesiastical authorities at Rome ;" that "the President could not be guilty of such an impertinence and has not been ;" and that "neither would Archbishop Ire-land be a party to such an interference of our Government with purely ecclesiasti-cal matters." But The Independent did not seem quite so positive with reference to another report that "comes from Rome that President Cleveland in his last term asked for Archbishop Ireland's nomina-tion to the cardinalate, and that it would then have been given but for the fact that Monsignor Satolli, then Apostolic Delegate at Washington, had the first claim." The Independent mildly ob-served that "this last rumor seems quite improbable." While we do not question for an in-stant The Independent's positive declara- tion that President Roosevelt has not done what it was rumored he had done, we do not believe for an instant the added declaration that Archbishop Ireland would not "be a party to such an interfer-ence of our Government with purely ec-clesiastical matters." If The Independ-ent has anything to offer in support of this declaration, it should offer it, for there are things of public notoriety for years back that go to show exactly the op-posite, at least which show that the Arch-bishop has no scruples against interfering in his capacity as an ecclesiastic in pure-ly political and governmental matters, whatever may be his scrupulosity with regard to governmental interference in "purely ecclesiastical matters." The Independent said the report which it authoritatively denied was so absurd and ridiculous on the face of it that, until the action by the Wisconsin Methodists, it could take no notice of it except to laugh at it. But though it deigned only to be amused at a report which reflected so se-riously upon the President of the United States, a report which, whether true or false, could not be a humorous matter, fortunately, to most people, The Independ-ent was at once greatly sobered and dis-tressed by "a ridiculous little ecclesiasti-cal outbreak among our Methodist brethren," and proceeded to mete out quick and stern treatment to those who had shown such readiness "to give cur- rency and disguised credence to a dam-aging report relating to the Catholic Church." And the editorial treatment administered was not without some fea-tures that remind one strongly of the sort of ebullitions which The Independent a short time ago was strongly reproba-ting in some of its Roman Catholic con- temporaries, who were also wrought up over the "quite too ready" disposition which they thought they saw in various quarters to give currency and credence to
