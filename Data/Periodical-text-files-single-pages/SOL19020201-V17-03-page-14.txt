152 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY In a government where church and state are separated there is not, and cannot be assumed to be, any such fundamental distinction between the Christian Sabbath and other week days as to make that which is permissible on six days a crime on the seventh. . . . The saloon problem on Sunday does not seem to me radically different from the same problem on other days.ŠCHARLES SPRAGUE SMITH, Director of the People's Institute, Cooper Union, New York, in the New York Journal. The doctrine of complete separation of church and state, carried to its logical sequence, forbids any attempt to establish one day as set apart for religious observance with its moral requirements enforced by legislation. Sunday will undoubtedly continue to be a religious day, sacred for religious uses, and observed by multitudes who see in such observance the best interests of the individual, the family, of the state; BUT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO CALL UPON THE SECULAR POWER TO COMPEL OTHERS TO ADOPT THEIR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS AND CONFORM TO THEIR RELIGIOUS IDEAS. All that they can do is to ask that they shall be protected in their rights, and allowed without unnecessary disturbance to keep the. day sacred to religious uses.ŠGENERAL THOMAS J. MORGAN, LL. D., Corresponding Secretary Baptist Home Mission Society, and former Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the New York Journal. The first essential for an ideal Sunday is an absolute separation of church and state, which are joined together for Sunday legislation; and an entire re-moval of all restrictions. The church which cannot make its own festivals respected by superior merit, and needs the help of law to throttle its competitors. must be in a sad state. And unless these laws should go so far as to force attend-ance at religious services, they can do no more than to keep non-churchgoers front innocent amusements; thus arousing resentment against ecclesiastical interference. The churches should consider whether the policy of demanding stringent Sunday legislation has not done them more harm in creating resentment than it has bene-fitted them in removing competition. Ł THE FIRST STEP, THEN, TOWARD AN IDEAL SUNDAY IS TO REPEAL ALL LAWS WHICH ENFORCE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUNDAY AND OTHER DAYS. . . . Before there can be an ideal Sunday there must be an ideal Monday, an ideal week, and an ideal year.: We must stop preaching goodness for the one day in the week, and condoning injustice for the other six. . . . The solution of the Sunday question . . . is not to be found in restrictions and in charity, but in freedom, and in that justice which shall recognize the equal rights of all men.ŠBOLTON HALL, in the New York Journal.
