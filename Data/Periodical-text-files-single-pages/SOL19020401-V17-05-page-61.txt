I enclose $1 for the renewal of my subscrip-tion. I think THE SENTINEL much improved. Ł ELDER R. A. UNDERWOOD. THIS HAS THE RIGHT RING. Enclosed find $1 for THE SENTINEL for 1902. We appreciate THE SENTINEL and al- ways expect to take. it. WM. BUTCHER. ADMIRES *THE LAST CHANGE. I very much admire the last change made  in THE SENTINEL, and do not want to miss a single number while it is published. T. S. MOORE. A NECESSITY. Please find enclosed $1 for which you will renew THE SENTINEL to me for another year, as I do not know how to get along without it. D. H. MCKEAN. RATHER HAVE THE SENTINEL THAN COMFORTS. THE SENTINEL is so valuable to me that I cannot do without it. In order to obtain it, things to add to my comfort have to be left out. MARTHA B. TRIPP. PLEASED WITH PRESENT IMPROVED CONDITION. I have just received your letter of the iith and will enclose the amount for the next year. I am very well pleased with the present im-proved condition of THE SENTINEL. We don't think we can get along without it. S. BOOTH. A LARGE NUMBER of persons have sent us five or more names, taking advantage of our offer to wrap and mail THE SENTINEL to each individual sep-arately, at the rate of 20 cents each for three months. One such club now running con-tains 297 names. These are all going to in-fluential men in one city. Are all the leading men of yotir city, town, or county receiving THE SENTINEL? If they are not, why not send us a club? If you can-not afford to do this yourself, perhaps you can get some friend or friends of THE SEN-TINEL in your vicinity to join you. Talk the matter over and let us know the result. Ł WHAT HAVE YOU DONE with those coupons recently sent you? If you have not already handed them out, please do so at once. Remember it costs you noth-ing, and you stand a good chance of being enabled. to renew your subscription at a re-duced rate, for if we receive even one of the coupons back, you have that privilege. If any of our subscribers can use additional cou-pons we will be glad to mail them. This is an easy way for you to help increase the cir-culation of THE SENTINEL, and we hope that all of our friends will help. Ten thousand new subscriptions before May i is what we ought to get.
