14 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. discovery of its falseness.should be limited to so small a portion of the human family. Its victims usually perceive the wrong when they feel its burden; yet it has often happened, as was the case with our Puritan Fathers, that they no sooner cease to be victims than they are ready to become oppressorsŠforgetting, " as victors, the lessons which as victims they had learned." One would think that so simple a proposition as that which affirms the exist-ence and inalienable character of the rights of a religious conscience as above and beyond all human authority ought to have been among the earliest and most widely-extended discov-eries of the race. The fact, however, is sadly the reverse. Of all the forms of wrong which men have suffered from each other, none have been less reasonable or more merciless and unrelenting than those of religious zeal armed with the civil power. There is no darker chapter in the history of Governments than that which chronicles their misdeeds in the attempt to administer and propagate religion. The attempt is essentially a horrible human tyranny.  begun, and every step of the process is that tyranny continued. The doctrine of a personal God, related to men as their Creator and Preserver, being received into the mind as the objective basis of religion, naturally connects itself with the idea of this God as a supreme lawgiver, to whose authority we are directly subject and from whose administrative control no power can release us. His will, no matter how as-certained, is the final law. Peter and John were simply true to universal thought when they said: "We ought to obey God rather than men." Daniel was true to the same thought when he disregarded the edict of a king rather than violate that of his God. The martyrs who took joyfully the .spoiling of their goods and cheerfully died at the stake for what they regarded as obedience to God were true to the doctrine that God, and not man, is the supreme ruler, and that the authority of the latterŠwhether that of the parent, the magistrate, the legislative assem-bly, or the kingŠwhen in conflict with that of the former, is not for a moment to be regarded. No human law can outlaw the law of God. There is but one supreme authority in the universe, and this is exclusively vested in God himself. No one disputes this proposi-tion who believes in the existence of a per-sonal God. It is one of the first truths of all religion. Now, as to the question whether there is such a God, thus related to each individual man, and, if so, as to what are his laws and what duties he requires.us to perform; and as to the further question whether this God has made a supernatural revelation of his will to men, and, if so, as to what that revelation containsŠas to these questions no human being, unless directly inspired by God himself; can authoritatively judge for another. What others think may be a source of light, and, in this sense, of value; but it is no rule to the individual, unless he thinks the same thing. He must adopt their thoughts before they can become his rule; and in doing so it is not possible for him to disown his own reason or  his own conscience. These faculties form his best, light, and necessarily imply a negation of the authority of any other human being to govern his thoughts, or the right of any hu-man power forcibly to interfere with their peaceable exercise. God has established no ecclesiastical bureau in any earthly Govern-ment to take the religious charge of the in-dividual reason and conscience, to supersede their personal functions, and dispense truth and piety to men according to order. All such bureaus, whether managed by kings or popes, invade a province exclusively occupied by the divine Government, and, hence, insult the Majesty of Heaven while they outrage the rights of earth. Each individual soul must and does think for itself upon its own direct responsibility to the King of kings; and that, too, no matter how ignorant or how much superstition may have warped the understand-ing. What it thinks is necessarily a law whose jurisdiction no merely human opinion or authority can either displace or destroy. It is sovereign for the individual. Moreover, religion consists essentially in voluntary homage and obedience rendered to God by a rational and accountable being. Its spiritual phenomena belong to a realm to which no human authority can extend. Such authority may punish.  their outward expression or the want of such expression; but the seat of religion lies beyond its agency. No parent can lash his child into piety and no king can make his subjects devout toward God by com-manding them to be so. Religion was never forced into any soul, or forced out of it. Whoever worships and obeys God, Ł worships and obeys the God of whom he thinks, and in whose existence he believes. He does so under the inner guidance of his own reason and conscience, and not under the authority of the reason and conscience of another. This is the immutable law of his own being, as well as of the character of the service rendered. It follows, then, from the very nature of religion, as a matter between the soul and its God, from the absolute and supreme authority of God and from the necessary supremacy of the individual reason and conscience in deter-mining the religious question between God and the soul, that civil Governments cannot extend their agency to the administration or regulation of religion without committing a trespass upon the rights of God and man at the same time. Thepeannot make its laws, since here God himself is the sole lawgiver. They cannot add to its sanctions or modify or cancel its claims. They cannot coerce men into piety, since the service itself admits of no coercion. They cannot destroy the authority-of the individual reason and conscience, since this authority is indestructible by any human power. Each soul, as to its faith, its thoughts Ł and affections, and the obligations which bind it to God, is as free from the rightful control of human authority as it could be if no such authority existed. And this is what is meant by religious freedomŠfreedom not from God's authority, but from man's authority, so that each one is left 'to follow the dictates of his own conscience. This statement needs to be qualified by the  remark that no one, as a member of civil so-ciety, has a right so to exercise his religious liberty as to make himself a trespasser upon the rights of others, or act in a manner incon-sistent with the good order and safety of that society. While free to think what he pleases, and equally free peaceably to express and propagate his opinions, he is not free to com-mit acts which society cannot, in consistency with its own welfare, permit to be done with impunity, for any reasons. It is the province of just and enlightened legislation to fix the limits within which individual liberty must move, and beyond which it must yield to the general good. It is possible to err here; yet without such limits fixed somewhere the com-munity would be at the mercy of every man's superstition, and each would be licensed to do what he pleased under the color of religion. Society cannot, as an organism regulated by law, exist upon any such principle. A penal code to protect the rights of men by prevent-ing crime is, hence, not-repealed by the doc-trine of religious liberty. Restraining, then, the outward exercise of this liberty within the limits established by sound reason and impartial justice, human Governments have but a single additional duty to perform; and this is to protect it. Pro-tection here does not mean patronage, or sup-port, or regulation of religion in any way; but it does mean that no one, no matter who he is, or what may be his religion, or whether he belongs to the majority or the minority or stands absolutely alone, shall be interfered with when peaceably worshiping God accord-ing to the dictates of his own conscience or when peaceably imparting his religious con-victions to others, and that no one shall be compelled by law to perform any religious duty or be subject to any disability on the ground of non-performance, or be required by compulsory taxation to contribute to the main-tenance or propagation of any religious system. It does mean that, within the limits demanded by the rights of others, each individual shall be left absolutely free as to his religion and as to its social expression, being protected in his person against oppression and in his property against religious exactions. It does mean such a complete, universal, and impartial equal-ity before the laws as excludes all discrimina-tions among citizens on religious grounds, and permits every one to judge for himself as to what religion he shall adopt, or whether he shall adopt any, and then as to what he shall do or omit to do within the bounds of decency and social order. Protection is the one word that defines the whole duty of civil Govern-ment in respect to the religion of its citizens. This is all they need, all to which they are en-titled, and the utmost that a just Government can consistently render.ŠS. T. Spear, D. D.
