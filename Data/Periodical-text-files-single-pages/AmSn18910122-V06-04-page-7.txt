J: WAGGONER. History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world; Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ER-ROR iN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The ". Fathers of the C4tholic QhutCh" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the 'church, and The Incautious Lowering of the Standard of Pure Christianity, Developed the PAPACY which was simply a, new phase of paganiSm. It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fuliy developed, and was only Waiting; for supreme power.

By William Jackson Armstrong, (Late Inspector General of United States Consulates.) Ł This is one of the most intensely interesting and thoroughly reliable con-tributions to literature on Russia and the Nihilists ever published. It Comprises Mr. Armstrong's famous lecture on ﬁSiberia and the Nihili4ts" delivered first in Cooper Union, New York,-  and 'afterwards by special request of many eminent men in. Lincoln Hall, Washington), together with- some exceedingly interesting letters and newspaper criticisms from the pens of the author and George Kennan, the Siberian traveller. EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK because no' one can be intelligent upon the subject of which it treats without familiarity with its contents. Besides, the, book is a powerful stimulus to that love of liberty so essential to the maintenance of free Government. It contains some pointed and caustic criticisms 'upon Mr. Kennan's defense of the Russian Government after his first visit to that country, and explains WHY KENNAN WENT TO SIBERIA the second .time. The Centtiry which were the result of that .fully justify the position takenp and 'the - statements -made- by Mr. - Armstron;-, in 1883. 160 FACIES, PAPER COVERS, PRICE 25 Cents..
