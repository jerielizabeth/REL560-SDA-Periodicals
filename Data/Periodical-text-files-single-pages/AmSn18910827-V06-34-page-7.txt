If those ladies have proved themselves cotnReteut they are entitled to their certificates, under the law, and no person can justly deprive them of them. It is no business of the State what these sisters or any of the public school teachers do with their money, and there is no violation of State law in giving the money they earn by teaching in the public schools to aid the spread of Catholicism if they want to. A Catholic school teacher has as much right to donate her money for this purpose as a Protestant teacher has to contribute her hard-earned savings to foreign missions, or to buying a new carpet for the parsonage. The law forbids the appropriation of money for the support of schools where religion is taught, and hence no teacher in a public school should be allowed to teach religion or permit religious observances or ceremonies of any kind in the school room. This is a very wise pro-vision, and should be strictly enforced, but there should be no discrimination in the choice of teach-ers because of difference of religious faith, or on account of a lack of it. That such a question as this should be raised for the reason given is almost past belief. Had the ob-jection to granting the certificates been on the ground that being devoted to the service of the Roman Catholic Church, and having adopted the peculiar garb of their order, they would necessarily, because of that peculiar dress, and naturally, be-cause of their devotion to that form of religion, exert a sectarian influence over their pupils, it would have been more reasonable ;Šwhich however is not saying much;Šfor it would seem that that question could have been safely left to the local school boards employing them. As it is it seems that in the case of these sisters bigotry and patern-alism have run wild. The writer is not prepared to say that objection might not properly be made to a distinctively religious garb in the public school room, but the idea that certificates should be re-fused solely on the ground that the persons receiv-ing them would, if employed, devote their wages to the interest of a particular church, is utterly re-pugnant to the spirit of our free institutions. Pa-ternalism could scarcely go further, and bigotry never attained a more vigorous growth even in the hot-bed of mediooval superstition. C. P. B. . Ł- THE fight over closing the saloons on Sunday still goes on in Denver, Colorado. A case has just heen taken to the District Court, and Judge Bently has heard the argument as to why a rule should not be entered requiring the police commission to allow the saloons to be opened. The Catholic Total Abstinence Union on Sunday Laws. it was a Catholic society that passed such a resolu-tion, but because of the .principle involved, The facts show that Protestants and Catholics alike will persecute when they have the power of -the State at their command and are devoid of the power and enlightening influence of the Spirit of God. And just as soon as the State commits itself. to Sunday laws, it advances ecclesiastical rule just that much, and opens the way for 'much more to follow. Protect all in their rights, but compel no religious belief, even though all the world was a unit in believing it to be right, THE Catholic Total Abstinence Union met in Washington, D. C., August 5. In a preamble to one of their resolutions they gave as one of the rea-sons why they oppose the liquor traffic that it is " by its sales constantly weakening the hallowed, restraining influence of Sunday." A resolution was offered pledging the support of the Union to labor organizations, believing that it could greatly assist the laboring man in securing his rights. But an influential priest counselled that they ought to know the principles of these labor unions before confederating with them. He said they might be socialistic, and also oppose Sunday observance. In view of these things the resolution was modi-fied so as to oppose a union with any labor leagues that were not in harmony with the Catholic Total Abstinence Union on these points. In addition to this discussion of the Sunday ques-tion at different times during the meeting, they passed the following resolution:Š " Resolved, that we consider it the duty of all temperance men to support candidates for public office who honestly pledge themselves to labor for the enforcement of Sunday laws closing liquor saloons on that day." The foregoing would indicate that Sunday re-ceived its full share of attention during the meet- ing of the Union. Let all good people bid them God-speed in anything they can do to advance total abstinence. It is one of the most laudable of causes. If they wish to use their influence to persuade people to observe Sunday better, it is surely their privilege to do so. But when they ask for civil law in its favor it is time to object. As much as the saloon is to be hated and as much as all lovers of mankind should labor to suppress it, yet to only shut it up on Sunday is a big step back instead of in advance. When the saloon is closed only on Sunday it cannot help making the impres-sion that it is the interests of Sunday being guarded, and that the saloon is not so bad if it is only strictly boycotted on Sunday. But this is only another of the many indications that Sunday laws are becoming very popular, and that the tyranical reign of ecclesiasticism, that always sets the wheels of oppression in motion wherever it is allowed the power, is striving for recognition. This statement is not made because    . - ŁŁ Ł             FAIR HAVEN, a popular summer resort on Buz-zards Bay, Massachusetts, is enforcing Sunday ob-servance. The law which has been put in force provides thatŠ " Whoever is present at a game, sport, play or public diversion, except a concert of sacred music, upon the evening of the Lord's day or upon the evening next preceding the Lord's day, unless such game, sport, play or public diversion is licensed by the persons or board authorized to grant licenses in such cases, shall be punishable by a fine not ex-ceeding five dollars for each offense. " Whoever on the Lord's day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any man-ner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity or charity, or takes part in any sport, game or play, or except as allowed or prohibited in the preceding section, is present at any dancing or public diversion, show, game or entertainment, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding fifty dol-lars for each offense." Even Mr. Crafts would scarcely have the hardi-hood to claim that this is a law for the enforcement of a merely civil day: it is plainly a civil ordinance requiring the observance of a religious institution; and in this respect it is not unlike all other Sunday laws; the underlying thought and motive in all of them is religious. A PETITION is being circulated in Sibley, Iowa, asking that all places of business be closed on Sun-day. Ł $  Ł  THE Government should know no Protestants and no Catholics, but only citizens.    Ł              " THERE is always retribution for persecution."               SACRED CHRONOLOGY, BY SYLVESTER BLISS. THIS work treats of the Elements of Chronol-ogy, the different systems, and the various eras, and gives the chronology of the principal events recorded in sacred history from the creation till the death of St. John. It also contains a vindica-tion of the numbers of the Hebrew Scriptures. As an aid to investigation it is invaluable. The book has been thoroughly revised, and an entire chapter added, on the PEOPLING OF THE EARTH. This chapter is an exposition of the tenth chapter of Genesis, and gives an outline of the beginning of history and THE ORIGIN OF NATIONS. New and valuable notes have been added to the original text of the book, making it the most val-uable work on the subject of sacred chronology extant. No student of history can well do with-out it. It contains a vast amount of information in small space, and so far from being dry it is as interesting as a story, which it really is. 300 pages, cloth binding, with side stamp, $ 1 .00.
