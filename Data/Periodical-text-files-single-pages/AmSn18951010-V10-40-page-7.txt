Says Prof. E. A. Sheldon, Presi-dent of the New York State Normal School, Oswego, "that so much that is valm.ble for one to know is brought into so small a compass, and sold for so small a price."

C AN-  SEA NrrinNTiox_4., 319 THE Catholic Review, of this city, is a champion of rigid Sunday observance. Speak- ing of those who favor a " liberal " Sunday, it says:Š It is full time, however, that these imported "Lib-erals," whether actuated by the interests of the brew-ers and saloon-keepers, or by the wish to undermine the Christian character of our institutions, should try to understand the fundamental fact that this is a Christian land. The next fact growing out of this is that Sunday as the Lord's day, and not' a secular hol-iday, is fundamental to our laws, forms an inherent part of the unwritten constitution, and therefore can-not be " liberalized " by any mere statute of the leg-islature. If this be a Christian land, then it must be, in the opinion of the Catholic Review, a Cath-olic Christian land, since the papal church does not recognize Protestantism as being of a Christian character. This is a claim which the Catholic Church has already advanced, and which it will not be slow to establish, by every device in its power. There is in this " Christian nation" doctrine a pent-up flood of religious animosity and strife; for let the idea once become settled in all minds that this is a " Christian land," in a governmental sense, and it will become at once imperative to determine who are the Christians. And while each separate denomination can settle the question satisfactorily among themselves, there will be unending difficulty in settling it satisfactorily for all. Old controversies will be revived and new ones will be added; and those who finally establish themselves as the " Christians " to whom this land belongs, will have to do so by intrigue and force rather than by the testimony of Christian lives. Ł -O. "STEPS TO CHRIST." WE are pleased to inform our readers that the very valuable little book, " Steps to Christ," originally published in English by the Fleming H. Revell Company, and subsequently trans-lated into a number of different languages, is now published in Portuguese by the Interna-tional Tract Society, Battle Creek, Mich. The book is undenominational, and is one of the most valuable practical Christian works ever printed. The Portuguese edition is handsomely illustrated, contains 166 pages, is neatly bound in cloth embossed in silver, and sells for 60 cents per copy, with the usual discount to the trade and to agents. No better book could be put into the hands ofŁ the people than " Steps to Christ."
