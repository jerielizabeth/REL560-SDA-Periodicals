Is the experience of half a century  of value? For more than fifty years the publishers of LIFE AND HEALTH have been advocating rational health and conserva-tion principles, the principles which are today recognized as being essential to national and individual success. Life & Health recommends vegetarianism seven days a week, instead of only a portion of the week. LIFE AND HEALTH is a cham-pion of temperance in all things. It was one of the first to advo-cate what is now termed " the simple life." Thousands freely state that they owe their good health, and perhaps life itself, to following the health principles set forth in this journal.
