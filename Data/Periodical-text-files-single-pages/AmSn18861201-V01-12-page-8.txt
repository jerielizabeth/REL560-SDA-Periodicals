98 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. Christ the Way of Life. WE have a select stock of this beautiful and instructive steel-plate engraving, with keys in the Danish, Swedish, German, French, and English languages. The design of this engraving is to present at one view the leading events in the history of man as related to the divine plan of redemption, from the time of the first sin and the fall to the final restoration of the race to the Paradise of God. Its central figure is that of Christ hanging upon the cruel cross. By taking our position at the foot of the cross, we look backward in the history of man, and trace the steps which have led to the scenes of Calvary. The scenes which suggest the provisions of the gospel are en-acted in the shadow of the cross, which is cast far back over the history of the race, reaching even to the gates of Eden. The "Way of Life," as a work of art, commends itself to all lovers of the beautiful. Unlike many religious al-legorical pictures, this not only presents a sacred theme, but by its skillful grouping, and its harmonious combina-tion of light and shade, it delights the cultivated taste, and suggests abundant food for thought. THE KEY. An elegant 12-mo. pamphlet of 48 pages, containing a description of every part of the picture, and an impress. ive article by Mrs. E. G. White, accompanies each en-graving.
