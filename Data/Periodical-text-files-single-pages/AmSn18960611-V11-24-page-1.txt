THE present disturbed state of Armenia, which has been at-tended with so m ugh bloodshed, and characterized by atrocities worthy of the Dark Ages, lends a peculiar in teres t to the history of that unhappy country. The origin of the Armenians is lost in the mists of an tiquity. According to tradition they are descended from Togarmah, a grand-son of Japheth, one of the three sons of Noah, who settled in Armenia, after the ark rested upon Mount Ararat. Tradition al so relates that the gospel was preached in Armenia early in the first century by the apostles Thad-deus and Barthole- mew; and certain Prone the Missionary !Herald. it is that in A. D. 276, both the king and the great mass of his people became at least nominally Christian. " As a Christian nation whose lot has been cast beyond the frontiers of Christendom," says Alice Stone Blackwell, " the Armenians  have had to suffer constant persecution,Šin early times from the Persian fire worship-ers, in later centuries from the Mohamme-dans." The Armenians received aid and sympathy from the Crusaders, and in return gave them active support. This is doubtless one reason for the hatred with which they are regarded by the Mohammedans everywhere.

"Since then," says the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," " the Armenians have had no political position as a nation, though they continue to form an im-portant and valuable portion of the popula-tion in Russia, Turkey, and Persia."' In A. D. 450, the Persian king sent a letter to the Armenian princes in which he highly extolled fire worship, contrasting it with Christianity, much to the disadvantage of the latter, as he painted it, and demanding that the Armenians should embrace the religion of Persia. Upon receipt of the king's letter a council was called, and after due deliberation, an an-swer was returned to the imperious letter of the Persian monarch. By permission. The Reply of the Armenians.
