77o THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY "vile slanders" and damaging reports "relating to the Catholic Church" and some of its representatives. So it was declared that these Method-ists, in giving credence and currency to this "canard" as they did, were guilty of an "impertinence of which they ought not to have been guilty," and it was inti-mated quite directly that they had there-by insulted the President, and that they and all others who give credence to this and other "such vile slanders" "about the Catholic Church," are fools and destitute of "Christian charity." It is admitted, "presumably," that some of such persons may have "Christian hearts," but it is asked, "How can we credit them with be-ing guided by intelligent heads ?" Now perhaps all this is all right and just what the circumstances called for, but it does not leave one's mind as clear and contented about this matter as it ought to be left. For instance : In view of the fact that Archbishop Ireland has been enabled to make such improper and unwarrantable intrusions and interfer-ences in governmental affairs, notably at the time of the opening of the Spanish-American war and more recently in con-nection with a matter pertaining to the government of the Philippines, for it has been declared in The Independent itself that it was due to the scheming of Arch-bishop Ireland that the American "mis-sion" was sent to the Vatican,Šwe say, in view of this fact which admits of scarcely any escape from the conclusion that not only very intimate but improper relations have been sustained at different times between the Archbishop as an ec-clesiastic and the highest authorities at Washington; and in view of the further facts that the rumor was not only a re-peated rumor at this time which met with no denial, and that a very similar rumor has been circulated from time to time without denial for several years past, it being declared at one time that the pred-ecessor of President Roosevelt had -au-thorized Secretary Hay to inform the Pope of Archbishop Ireland's great ser-vice to this country in guiding Catholic opinion and sentiment when this country was at war with a Roman Catholic coun-try" and to urge "the Vatican to confer on the Archbishop of St. Paul such hon-ors as the Church could on a 'worthy and accomplished son,' " and that "the late Senator Davis wrote a similar letter at the same time,"Šwe say, in view of all this, yes, and in view of the further fact that the Government has taken the un-precedented and astonishing step of send-ing a representative to the Vatican and negotiating with the Pope, why should it be considered such an inexcusable and outrageous thing to give some credence to the repeated and undenied report that the American President had intimated to the Pope that he would be pleased to see Archbishop Ireland made a cardinal ? And if under these circumstances writing publicly to the President to inquire if there was any truth in the rumor and to express disapproval of what it affirmed, was such a terribly impertinent and in-sulting thing, what was it for Archbishop Ireland and any others who may have been concerned to do things which not only made such a" rumor possible, but gave to what it affirmed an aspect of the greatest probability? We do not ask what it was for Archbishop Ireland and those who serve him to promote and fos-ter such rumors and to plan and work by every hook and crook for the accom-plishment of the utterly un-American and unconstitutional thing which the rumor affirmed, but if we are to judge from the facts that are public and known, we must conclude that if all the facts in the mat-ter were known this question would be very pertinent and proper. And if these Methodists must be reproved so severely
