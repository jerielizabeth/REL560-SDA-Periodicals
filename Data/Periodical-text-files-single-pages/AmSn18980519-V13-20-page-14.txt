Pitcairn Island. one of the volcanic gems of the Pacific, has been heard of wherever the Eng-lish language has been spoken. The story of the working out of the problem of human life on its limited territory reads stranger and more thrill-ingly in many respects than a romance. But most, it not all, of the tales told and books printed have either been too fragmentary or in-correct and misleading. It will be interesting to the friends of that miniature world to know that an authentic history has been written, and that by a native of the island, one to the manor born. Miss Rosa Young is one of the direct descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty. The book is a plain, unvarnished tale of Pitcairn and its inhab-itants from its settlement to the year 1894. It is written with a charming simplicity of style which refreshes the reader and invites a contin-ual perusal. Illustrated with 26 engravings by the half-tone process, and its 23 chapters have each a neatly engraved heading. Price, 81.00 PACIFIC PRESS PUPLISHING CO., 39 Bond St., New York City, N. Y.

Invaluable to Bible and History Students THE RIPIUS OF THE BIBLE FROM THE TIME OF THE FLOOD TO THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY. By ALONZO T. JONES. Recent research in Babylon and Egypt has brought to light many vain able historical records that were inscribed in stone by the very men living in those ancient times. These records and the Bible history of the same time are woven together in one connected story. Another important feature of the book is the tracing in a series of twenty-one maps, the course of those empires. The design of the book is unique, and every student either of Bibb or history will find it invaluable. 410 Pages. Cloth, Post-paid, $1.50. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 39 BOND STREET, NEW YORK.
