AMERICAN SENTINEL, 39 Bond Street, New York. That " Superb " Bible. Dodgeville, Wis. AMERICAN SENTINEL, New York City: The Bible came to hand all right. To say that I am pleased with it will but faintly describe my feelings. It would take too much space to enumerate its many points of excellence, so I will sum it all up in the one word "su-perb." There are so many "aids to the study of the Scrip-tures," and they are so helpful and just what I have been wishing for since I became a " Bible Christian." Friends and neighbors all say, "I wish I had one like it," and "Sp cheap." Our seventeen-year-old daughter is about to start out to obtain subscriptions for the SENTINEL, as she wishes for one "just like it." Please accept my warmest thanks, and believe me to be, Ever sincerely yours, R. G. W. COLLINS. [See advertisement on last page.] Invaluable to Bible and History Students. THE ENIllgS OF THE BIBLE FROM THE TIME OF THE FLOOD TO THE BABYLONIAN CAPTIVITY. By ALONZO T. JONES. Recent research in Babylon and Egypt has brought to light many valu-able historical records that were inscribed in stone by the very men living in those ancient times. These records and the Bible history of the same time are woven together in one connected story. Another important feature of the book is the tracing in a series of twenty-one maps, the course of those empires. The design of the book is unique, and every student either of Bible or history will find it invaluable. 410 Pages. Cloth, Post-paid, $1.50. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING COMPANY, 39 Bond Street, New York City, N. Y. Kansas City, Mo. Oakland, Cal. The nights of the People, or -Civil 6oVernment and Religion. By ALONZO T. JONES. THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST BOOKS THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN ON THE RELATION.OF THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION. + 49 + It shows how Christianity advanced in the Roman Empire, not only without the aid of the State, but in the face of the bitterest opposition from the State; it discusses what the Christian should render to God, and what to the State, and how the powers that be are ordained of God. The book then takes up the history and principles of the movement so active now in the United States, looking toward having the Church try to regulate and cleanse politics, and shows what will be the certain results of following the policy advocated by some of these church men. No matter what your views upon this question, you cannot afford to miss reading this book. Cloth, 378 pp., . 81.00. Paper Covers, . . . . .40.

The history made just previous to the Civil War forms a mos. vital part of the national annals, and should, in itself, warrant the stud of those times. But in view of the present attack upon the Constitution, this subject becomes one of the greatest importance to every thinking  in-dividual.
