756 AMERICAN SENTINEL. one who works seven days in the week. The law is rest one day in seven, and he who violates that law pays for it in the value of his products." And thus it appears that the result of allowing Sun-day work will be a disastrous over-production, while at the same time the result of Sunday rest will be, in the course of six months, the production of twice as much as would be possible with Sunday work. You can argue with an individual for a Sunday law on theground of the evil of over-production, and if this does not convert him, you can tell him that with Sunday rest a factory can pro-duce twice as much inside of a year as would be possible without it; and both arguments will be equally good ! If we enforce the Sunday laws, we will have over-pro-duction, according to Rev. Mr. Dick; and if we fail to en-force such laws, we will have the same result, according to Mr. Charlton. Hence it appears that we are bound to have over-production anyway! The advocates of Sunday laws sometimes lose much by failing to compare notes before giving their "argu-ments" to the public. Ł The Church and Politics. CONSIDERABLE controversy has arisen in some quar-ters over the relation the late Henry George sustained to the churches of New York City. Everybody knew Mr. George as a politician of the most pronounced type. But now it is being made to appear that he was also a devout Christian. On this ground a minister in Omaha, it seems, took occasion publicly to upbraid the churches of Mr. George's city for not better sustaining him politically in his fatal canvass for the mayoralty, alleging that pluto-cratic influences were behind their actions. Whether such charges could be fully sustained or not, is neither here nor there. It is well known that Mr. George held peculiar views regarding rich men and their estates, and these probablyinfluenced the actions of these men, more or less, in their attitude toward Mr. George. But church members, whether rich or poor, are not bound to sustain a man politically because he is friendly to the Christian religion. The mission of the church is one thing, that of political organizations entirely another. The church is a divine institution, political systems are entirely earthly. The work of one is to preach the gos-pel of peace, the other to maintain party preeminence. The church has nothing in common with the various opinions relating to civil polity, but is, or should be wholly engaged in matters pertaining to the kingdom of God, which Christ has assured us is not of this world. The more church organizations affiliate with politicS, the less zealous they become in the work laid out for them by the divine Master. Before his return from earth to heaven, the Lord prayed earnestly that his followers might be one in their work, even as he and the Father are one. But when politics are permitted to become an es-sential feature in the welfare of the church, confusion and  disunion quickly follow. The reason for this is plain. No affinity whatever exists between the two concerns. The work of the church is a spiritual one, set in order and conducted by divine instruction, which all are supposed faithfully to adhere to, while political affairs are planned and maneuvered by human minds, not infrequently for sordid purposes. The members of the church were to be united through a divine fellowship. This breaks down every barrier of political distinction, or class preference; the high and low, the rich and poor, are expected to stand together in Christian companionship, bound by the sacred ties of holy love. In their common warfare against the wiles of sin, this complete union is necessary to prosperity. By this complete unison of sentiment and action the world also will be apprised that the purpose of the church is a true and noble one, and that its mission is a success. In politics the tendency is to class distinction. Men of wealth usually enjoy the highest civil discrimination, by being placed in position and authority, who in turn reward with place andpower those who have contributed to their elevation. Worldly policy and worldly schemes obtain in this work, and quite often any device that may tend to defeat an opponent is justified as expedient. With such work the church can rightly have nothing to do. Its members are registered as citizens of the king-dom of God, in which Machiavelian tactics are unknown. Its adherents have been by the gospel called "out of the world," hence are "no longer in the world," so far as its strife for honor and power is concerned. While rendering to Csar the things that are his, as sojourners in an earthly government, members of Christ's kingdom should never betray their Master by giving the strength of the church to political intrigues, thus uniting the church and the state only to corrupt the former, and make the latter an engine of intolerant bigotry. J. O. C. -4 A Significant Incident. THE following incident, the account of which comes to us from a correspondent in a Western town, is signifi-cant of the spirit of the times. In this town, which is in the State of Washington, a number of people have recently been  converted to the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath. Among these were twoŠfather and sonŠwhose business was that of box-nailing. They were employed in a box factory with seven other men, the latter being Methodists, Pres-byterians, and Episcopalians. Our correspondent says:Š "Preceding the third Sabbath theykept, the manager of the box factory received an order for 5,000 boxes, which was to be filled by sunset Sunday evening. He told the two they would have to work Saturday. They told him they could not do that, but they would come back and work for him after sunset Saturday, and nail as many boxes as they would nail if they should work on the Sabbath; and they would work again for him on Sun-
