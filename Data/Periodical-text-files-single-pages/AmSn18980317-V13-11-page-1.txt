  "IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BRT 'WYE  NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT."ŠJeans Christ.   VoL. 13, No. 11. NEW YORK, MARCH 17, 1898. Single copy 3 cents.        The American Sentinel is published in the interests of religious libertyŠChristian and Constitutional. Ralf 'Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered .may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore those who have .not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it (Entered at the New York Post-office.) "JUDGE not, and ye shall not be judged." "Condemn -not, and ye shall not be condemn-ed." Ł11.- 411.` EVERY Christian is called of God to be a reformer, but 'not one is called to reform any nation, community, or in-dividual, by the power of legislatures or of courts. THE church might lobby till doomsday to secure leg-islation in behalf of religious institutions, without ever -convincing the world that there is such a thing as the power of godliness. As regards religion, the majority in this world have always been on the wrong side. Hence the vote of the majority in a religious question is practically certain to be on the side of error. MEN are not made good or bad by the government; but the government is madegood or bad by the men who conduct. it. Reform the men, and there will be no occa-&ion for a reform in the government. THE only government that is suited to a corrupt peo-ple is a despotism. When the American people become 'corrupt, a despotism must and will be set up over them. Despotism is the inevitable sequence of national corrup-tion. WHEN the "peace of God" rules in the heart, there is quiet in the soul; and that quietness is a hundred fold  Ł more essential to proper. Sabbath observance than all the quiet that can be secured by Sunday laws. Without it, indeed, no real Sabbath observance is possible. A SUNDAY law is a tax, demanding one seventh of all an individual's time. And this time is money to the in-dividual, but cannot possibly be such to the government which demands it. It is of all taxes the most absurd, useless, unwarranted, and unjust. God alone has the right to require one seventh of a person's time, and he alone has a wise purpose in requiring it. IT is very strange that a prayer-meeting or other re-ligious service can be held in the church on any "week-day" evening without being at all disturbed by work and traffic, but cannot be held on Sunday without "great disturbance," if there happens to be any work or traffic in the vicinity. One would think it was not possible to be religious except in the midst of absolute quiet. A Word More on the Flag Salute. IN reply to a correspondent from Iowa, who writes us that many people object to the SENTINEL'S opposition to the flag salute on the ground that it would stifle patriot-ism, we take occasion to say a word more on the salute in its relation to patriotism. The only salute we have specifically noticed is that used at Boulder, Col., which required the pupil to make a profession of allegiance to God. It was on this ground mainly that the SENTINEL opposed it. The flag salute is used in many other States; and so far as we know, in no other does it contain any reference to God. Without this it is of course much less objection-able. But there are some principles which apply to these salutes in general, by which we think their character for good or evil must be determined. It is our aim to touch upon these in this article.
