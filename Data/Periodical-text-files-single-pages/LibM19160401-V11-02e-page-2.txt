Foes of a Free Press and Free Speech at Their Lawless Work Pending Legislation Seeks to Legalize Such Tyranny Every attempt to gag the free expression of thought is an unsocial act, a crime against society. . . . It is very hard for a robber to convince his victims that he is acting in their behalf and for their good. Is there no par-allel between the gag of the burglar and the gag of the law? Why does the burglar use a gag? It is because he wants to get away with your goods, and he doesn't want you to make an outcry and call the neighbors. He knows that he cannot convince you by argument that he is entitled to the goods and that it is really to your best interest to pass them over to him. Å  Jay Fox.
