486 THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. mpty forms and ceremonies which make the chil-dren neither better nor more intelligent than they were before. We trust this description in this popu.: lar magazine will do something to awaken educators to a sense of the useless and dangerous character of the system of patriotic training now in vogue in the public schools, and to inaugurate a much-needed reform in this respect. s. A TALE OF TWO NATIONS. Our Place and Nation." WHEN the Master came to earth, the nation of Is-rael bowed the knee to the iron power of the mighty Rome. The disaster foretold by ancient seers, swift and sure as man's march to the grave, had indeed come. The chosen ones were a people bruised and broken, scattered and peeled, meted out, and trod-den under foot. This sad condition was but the penalty for the ac-tion of that notable, but dire day, upon which they had said to Samuel: " Make us a king to judge us like all the nations." The children of Jacob were suffering from the bite of apostasy, that asp which they themselves had willingly cherished in their own bosoms. This was the cause of their subjection to a foreign power. Had it not been for this, no Roman ensign would have waved over Jerusalem, no Ro-Roman sentinel would have stood at her gates, no Roman governor would have ruled within her walls. An'd now at last the King had come to bring them peace and healing. But him they did not want. A kingdom of service was not according to their minds. They desired that Christ should establish a tempo-ral kingdom, defended by human arms, and by force drive the hated Roman from the Land of Promise. But this was not the purpose of the Prince of Peace. The Jews were determined to make Christ their earthly, temporal king; but it is written: "When Jesus perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone." Little by little they began to perceive that the ideas of the Christ concerning earthly monarchy and power and their own ideas were widely different. The spirit of arbitrary rule had, since the days of Samuel, become deeply embedded in the hearts of the Jews. They thirsted to be the greatest temporal power on the earth. They had hoped to find a leader in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. Now that he  said them nay, they were bitterly disappointed. In their rage they turned upon the gentle Lamb of God and denounced him to the Romans as an inciter of insurrection and a raiser of rebellion. He had preached the gospel of his kingdom. They declared that this kingdom about which he spake so much must surely be an earthly, temporal one, which he proposed to set up in defiance of the authority of Rome. In other words, they charged the Master with the very crime which they themselves had been anxious to perpetrate. " Then gathered the chief priests and the Phari-sees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation." Christ had stedfastly refused to commit himself to the principles of earthly monarchs and monarchies. The imperialistic idea of government by force and without the consent of the governed found no place in that holy nature, and because he would not lend himself to this scheme they sought means to de-stroy him. They felt that it was necessary to their national welfare to be like all the other powers of earth. If they could not be like all of the others they feared that the Romans would come and take away their place and nation. That is, they believed that monarchical ideas and principles were necessary to their governmental existence. Christ was op-posed to this policy, so he must be made away with. For this reason they crucified the Lord of glory. This was the basal, the nerve thought, that they had in the crucifixion; but had they accepted Christ their natures would have been at peace with God and man. Not accepting him, the spirit of rebellion ran riot in their hearts, and from that day down to this they have had no place, they have been no natiou. From end to end of the earth they wander a homeless, unorgan-ized people. They failed to give the true light on religion to the world, and equally they failed to give the true light on government among men≈†gov-ernment by the consent of the governed. To-day they have no place, they are no nation. This has been the end of that bright dream of being like the nations around about. To-day another nation is treading over the same path toward the same goal. P. T. MAGAN. GOD is the only moral governor.
