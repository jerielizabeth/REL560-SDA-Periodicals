LIBERTY 173 arrest of a citizen who had exercised his . God-given right to equality in religious things, and in so doing refused to comply with the Sunday law of that State, which law, like all others, is in flagrant con-tradiction to the principles of the gospel  and to the First Amendment to the Uni- ted States Constitution, which says : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment, of religion, or prohibit-ing the free exercise thereof."
