TORTURE CHAMBER OF THE INQUISITION. Taking a Victim from the Rack. " The Inquisition was a very merciful tribunal; I repeat it, almost a compassionate tribunal. . A man was onl allowed to be racked once, which no one can deny was a most wonderful leniency in those times." See Mirror articl 011 page 288.

American Sentinel, PUBLISHED WEEKLY BY THE FOCIFIC l'AF,SS PUBLISHING coNrdNy, because " a man was only allowed to be racked once," is puerile. One racking was sufficient to dislocate many of the joints and to leave the victim a physical wreck, and  yet we are assured in the closing decade of the nineteenth ' century that the tribunal which habitually inflicted this fiendish torture was almost compassionate! . 55 BOND STREET, NEW Yomt CITY EDITOR, Ł Ł C.
