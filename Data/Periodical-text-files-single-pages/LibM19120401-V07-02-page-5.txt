Len,. 25: 10. Vol.. VII SECOND QUARTER, 1912 No. 2 A City Without a Sunday Law MILTON C. WILCOX SEEMINGLY, nothing could be more deplorable to our National Reform and Sunday-law friends than a city without a Sunday law, and a State similarly blessed. Hence they are putting forth their mightiest efforts to secure a Sunday law in California, which has been for years without any such encumbrance upon its statute-books. Its cities have gone on just like other cities. Most of its business places are closed on that day, not because they must perforce close on Sunday, but because the people have been generally taught to .observe the day. Thousands go to church, thou-sands more seek pleasure elsewhere, as they do in other great cities of our land. One would think, to read the ardent appeals made by Sunday-law men for " graceless California," that without a Sunday law it would be one of the wickedest and most godless places on the face of the earth. In view of such declarations repeat-edly made, we note for the readers of LIBERTY some opinions on the other side. For instance, Dr. Charles F.

On February  28 he said, in reference to a call from the Central Church of Chicago, from which Dr. Frank W.

Nothing that I know of, or might dream of, could make me leave this most lovable city. . . . I came to San Francisco ex-pecting to find it the wickedest city in the world. I had been led to expect Ševidently by those who knew nothing about the place Š that it was a sort of hell upon earth. I have found it an earthly paradise. Gay? frivolous? Š Certainly, but that is not wickedness. To call a city wicked, you must have wicked men for its citizens; but in San Francisco there is a finer set of men to dwell together and work together than in any other city that it has ever been my lot to know. San Franciscans are primarily honest men. Honesty is a preeminent characteristic of the men of San Francisco. They are clean-souled, strong-hearted, pure-minded men. . . . I wish people wouldn't talk as they do, so flippantly about wickedness. It is so easy to stand afar and hold hands up, and shock modesty, at the evils of some place that lights up its streets after twi-light." He declares that " in California 51
