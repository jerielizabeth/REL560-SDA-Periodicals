T NCTITRES ON NASAL CATARRH Its Nature, Causes, Prevention and Cure, and Diseases of the Throat, Eye and Ear, due to Nasal Ca- tarrh; with a chapter of CHOICE PRESCRIPTIONS BY J. H. KELLOGG, M. D., Medical Superintendent of the Largest Medical and Surgical Sanitarium in the World. The purposes of its preparation have been, in the words of the authorŠ " 1. To antagonize the popular notion that nasal catarrh is an incurable malady, an error that is productive of vast mischief, as it leads to neglect of the disease, entailing sufferings which timely attention might easily have prevented. "2. To provide in convenient form a manual of the hygiene of this disease, which is the most essential feature of its successful treatment. "3. To warn the public against catarrh charlatans, and the much-vaunted 'catarrh remedies' so widely advertised. The evils wrought by these 'workers of iniquity,' are almost beyond estimate. "4. To present an outline of the modern methods of treating this malady, as prac-ticed by scientific specialists, and also the results of the author's personal experience and observation in the treatment of some thousands of cases of this disease." The work consists of 120 pages, and is embellished with a colored frontispiece and Six 13eau.tifully Colored Plates, Besides many illustratife cuts of the throat and nasal cavity in health and disease. This little work costs only 30 cents, and is in great demand. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., Or 43 Bond Street, New York. OAKLAND, CAL. ME AMERICAN SENTINEL. 135 gt fiertistments.
