252 AMERICAN SENTINEL. Studies in French History.-18. "FRONT the days of the first king of France, Clovis, to about the beginning of the fourteenth century,Šwhere our last study closedŠthe country of France has been ruled by, first, the Merovingians, from 481 to 752 A. D.; next, the Carlovingians, from 752 to 987; then the Cape-tians, from 987 to 1328. "Now Philip VI. of Valois takes the empty throne, upon which none but the direct descendants of Hugh Capet had sat since that great monarch began his reign about 341 years before. "Philip VI., the first of the Valois branch, was a vain man, fond of pleasure, feasting, and excitement. During the reign of Philip the Fair, the proud, over-bearing nobles were kept somewhat from lording it over the poorer people. But this man had no notion of restrain-ing them in the least; so, of course, he pleased the aris-tocracy very much. About all he seemed to care about was to have a good time, and entertain the kings and princes of other nations in a right royal manner. In fact, hiStOrians say that he made Paris such an attrac-tive place that kings of other countries much preferred Paris, with its life of gayety and pleasure, to their own dull capitals at home. So the accommodating king would keep many of them as guests, in grandeur and splendor." "I should have thought Philip's pocket-money would have run short, after a while," said Jack Smith, who had already earned for himself the title of "practical Jack" among his friends. "But the fact is, Jack, that it was the poor peasantry and the working middle class who really paid the debts incurred by the king, and who supported his idle guests in such regal splendor. 9.nd then, as if to add insult to injury, the king declared that those nobles who lawfully owed debts to the poor peasants, need not be holden to pay them. "About this time, 1328, began the long feud between England and France, which is called the 'Hundred Years' War." "Please, professor," interrupted Jennie Jacobs, "who was the king of England at this time?" "Edward the Third. He was son of Isabella, who, you remember, was a daughter of Philip the Fair." "I wonder if that was the reason for his beginning the hundred years' war with France," said Charlie White. "Yes, he made it an excuse, and declared that he ought to be king of France because of it. So he sent  some ships over the English Channel to Flanders. A battle was fought at Sluys, in which the king of France was badly beaten, in fact, Philip's fleet was nearly de-stroyed." "What did Philip do, when he found this out?" asked Will Barnaby. "I suppose he had no idea but that he would beat Edward." "This was exactly what he did think. In fact, no-body dared tell him that he was beaten for some time. Then Edward waited to get a good excuse to strike an-other blow at his French cousin. About this time there was a miserable quarrel between two English counts, in which quarrel Philip was foolish enough to interfere. Of course Philip and Edward took opposite sides in the affair. Finally, the French were obliged to retire from the siege of Hennebon,Šwhere they were besieging the brave countess of Montfort, wife of the count whose cause Edward had espoused. ' "Another great battle between these two kings, in which the English gained a wonderful victory, and which they still point to with pride, was the battle of Crecy. The armor of the Frenchmen was so heavy that when they were once off their horses, they could not mount again." "Was Philip of Valois a brave man? or did he object to being present in battle?" asked Rob Billings. "No, Robert; that is something which cannot be said of him; no, he was no coward." "I suppose you mean he was not a physical coward." "A good point, Robert. You mean to ask if he were not a moral coward. I think he must have been, or he would not have encouraged the nobles in their unjust conduct toward the people. But he was physically a. brave man. He would not leave the battlefield at Crecy, even after his troops were so badly beaten, that there were only five knights left with him on the field. Then one of them led him forcibly from the battle. "It would be well to make a note of the fact," con-tinued Professor Carman, "that it is said that it was at the battle of Crecy, about 550 years ago, that cannon was first used." "May be the English used them, and the French hadn't got any made yet, and so were beaten," suggested Harry Ray. "No, Harry; you have quite a wrong idea of what cannons were in those early days." "I always suppose them to be very destructive weap-ons," whispered Will Barnaby, whose father was an old soldier. "They were indeed weapons of destruction, even then. But the trouble was, they were quite as apt to destroy those who fired them as they were the enemy; for, as they were not builtevery strong, they would often burst_ They then used stones instead of metal balls. The historian says that they no more resembled our modern cannon than a wheel-barrow does a locomotive. "Next week we will learn something of the battle of Calais." MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE.
