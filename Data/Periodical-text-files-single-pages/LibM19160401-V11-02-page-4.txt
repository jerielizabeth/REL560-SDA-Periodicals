The religion, then, of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; + + + + and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may + + dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. + + It is unalienable because the opinions of men, depending 4 +. + + only on the evidence contemplated in their own minds, can- + + + + not follow the dictates of other men. It is unalienable, + also, because what is here a right toward men is a duty + 4' + toward the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render + +  + to the Creator such homage, and such only, as he believes + to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in + + + + order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of + + civil society.Before any man canbeconsidered  as a mem- +  4. + ber of civil society, he must be considered as a subject of 4. + + the Governor of the universe; and if a member of civil + + + + society who enters into any subordinate association must + 4. + always do it with a reservation of his duty to the general 4. + + + authority, much more must every man who becomes a mem- + with  civil  of ber any particular society do it a saving of his + + allegiance to the universal Sovereign. We maintain, there- 4. +  + + fore, that in matters of religion no man's right is abridged + by the institution of civil society, and that religion is wholly + + + exempt from its cognizance. True it is that no other rule + + + exists by which any question which may divide a society can * + + be ultimately determined than the will of the majority; but + 4. + it is also true that the majority may trespass upon the rights + + + + + 4. of the minority.ŠFrom Madison's Memorial to the Virginia + + Legislature, 1785, protesting against " a bill establishing a pro- +Religion." + vision for teachers of the Christian ++ + + + ‚‚. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++•'
