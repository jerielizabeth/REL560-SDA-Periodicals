AMERICAN SENTINEL. 71 it will mean the same for us as it did for ChristŠpersecu-tion, and imprisonment or death: while if we stand on the other sideŠthe wrong sideŠit will mean our ultimate destruction. This is not because there is anything abitrary in this thing. In the Sabbath question there is the working out of principles that are as old as creation itself, and it is the recognition or the rejection of those principles that will land us finally in one or the other of the positions set forth above. It was an awful thing for the Jews to put Christ to death because he did not keep the Sabbath according to their ideas. They would not have done this had they known that he was the Lord of glory. 1 Cor. 2:8. Nor would they have done despite to the Spirit of grace had they discerned it. Why then did they do it? The an-swer is very simple. It was because they rejected God's idea of the Sabbath. And this serves to show how closely the Sabbath is related to Christ and the Holy Spirit. And it is as certain that two and two make four that in the rejection of God's idea of the Sabbath now, is involved the rejection of Christ and the Holy Spirit. Principles are no respecters of persons, and they are the same in all ages. But the answer to the question asked above suggests the further question, Why did they reject God's idea of the Sabbath? The answer to this question is just as simple as the other. It was because they were not will-ing to receive God's Word wherein God's idea is set forth. Had they known the law of the Sabbath they would have known that it was "lawful to do well on the Sab-bath days." See Matt. 12:1-13. But could they not have known? Certainly they could. Every Sabbath day the book containing the law of the Sabbath was read in their hearing. And when Christ showed them from this book, which they professed to believe, the truth of the matter, they simply refused to believe or to accept it. Had they accepted this testimony it would have led them unerringly to see that Christ was " God manifest in the flesh," and knowing this, they would not have crucified him. But " the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them " 2 Cor. 4:4. And so it is to-day. Like causes produce like effects. The Sabbath question now means the same that it meant in the time of Christ. Shall God's idea prevail? The same Book that contains the law of the Sabbath is in nearly every home. You, reader, doubtless have it. From it alone we have revealed God's idea as to the day of the Sabbath. As plainly as it is possible for words to express it, the statement is, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:8-11. The Lord of the Sabbath is our example, and he kept the seventh day. Thus we have both precept and example  of the highest authority for the keeping of the seventh day. Following these there can be no possible mistake. In the course of these articles, we have shown that the Sabbath now is the test of one's loyalty to Christ and his gospel. The advocates of Sunday, the first day, freely admit this; and they admit too, as has been shown, that there is no scripture authorizing the ob-servance of Sunday as the Sabbath or Lord's day. Their designating the day thus is purely an arbitrary act on their part. It is purely man's idea. To what will this, lead? We do not have merely the evidence of logic, based upon the action of the Pharisees, to give us the answer. We have before us indisputable proofs. Already it has resulted in persecution, imprison-ment, work in the chain-gang, etc., to those who, standing upon the plainly-written word of God, keep the seventh day in obedience to the law of their Maker, and as ex-emplified by their great Pattern. And this is only a beginning. "If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry ?" Truly, as Gibbon forcibly said: "It is incumbent on the authors of per-secution previously to reflect whether they are deter-mined to support it in the last extreme. They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties sug-gests the use and propriety of capital punishment." "Decline and Fall," chap. 37, par. 23, part 5. But bad as it will be for those who keep the day that Christ kept, it will be infinitely worse for those who re-ject it. For as the Sabbath, the seventh day, is insep-arably connected with Christ and the Holy Spirit, they cannot reject it without rejecting these, any more than could the Jews. But in rejecting the one do they mean to reject the others? Not any more than the Pharisees intended to reject the "Lord of glory." But that step was in the course that the Pharisees took; and the same is true now. Do they see this? Of course not; and simply because they will not accept the plain statement of God's Word that the "seventh day is the Sabbath." Were they to accept it they would see it just as clearly as the Pharisees would have seen what was in their course had they accepted the Word of God. And true Protestantism to day is that which pro-tests against the papal Sunday and those so-called Protestants who are seeking to have this papal institu-tion enforced upon the consciences of the people: through which protest the truly honest will be led to discern the trend of these things, and their results, and above all, that there is no agreement between the Holy Spirit and Sunday. THE character of a government must be a reflection of the character of the men who make it.
