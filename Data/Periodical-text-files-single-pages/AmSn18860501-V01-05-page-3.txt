Ntia'rolowman.  THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 35 let him hide his knowledge of the litera scripta of the ten commandments, for woe be to him if he crosses the track of "my faith"! We grow more and more distrustful of hu-manity when we read the literature of that people, and see their unblushing effrontery in declaring that a Religious Amendment to the National Constitution is necessary " to secure the rights of all classes." Can they possibly think that the people are so blind that they cannot perceive the deception which is being practiced? that they cannot discover the en-emy of equal rights lurking under these specious pretenses? We pity those who cannot see this. We must blame those who will not see the danger impending, or who are in any wise instrumental in precipitating such a calamity upon our country. They are not asking for protection, for this they now have most fully; they are seeking for power. And their own avowals prove that if ever they get the power they seek, this land will cease to be " the land of the free." J. II. W. A Lesson, from Ezra. WHILE the so-called " National Reformers" continually deny that their movement has any likeness to a proposed union of Church and State, they do not deny that they want to make such changes in our national Constitution.  as will place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fun-damental law of the land. It is true that they insert the words "of our Government," after " usages; " but as our Government has no Christian usages, all understand that the usages of the Christian church are referred to. The design of the National Reform party is, then, to so change the Constitution that Christian usages may be enforced by civil law. It is not neces-sary for us to call it a union of Church and State; we will simply remember that the avowed purpose is to make it possible to com-pel ,people to follow certain Christian usages, and this by the power of the law of the land. Since the advocates of this state of affairs are fond of referring to the Bible for precedents for their proposed scheme; and since they imagine that they are following in the footsteps of the ancient worthies, we invite them to a brief con-sideration of the course which was pursued by one excellent man of old, " a ruler in Israel." Ezra was undoubtedly a man of God. He was a man of stern integrity and of the most sincere piety. Moreover, he was a statesman, well versed in the ways of courts, and was also a brave soldier, and a skilled leader of men. When, after long delay, and much discourage-ment, the Jews were confirmed in the privileges granted them by Cyrus, king of Persia, Ezra was the one to whom the work of restoring Jerusalem was intrusted. The Jews had been captives in a foreign land, but God had worked upon the hearts of the heathen king, so that they were allowed to return to their own land and re-establish the worship of Jehovah. With quite a train of followers, Ezra set out for his own country. But the way was long and dangerous, and there were many even of the subjects of the king of Persia, who wished only evil to the Jews and their work. Here  was the time, if ever, for Ezra to invoke the aid of the king, and secure a company of soldiers to protect him and his companions. But he did no such thing. After getting his people to-gether, he halted at the river of Ahava (Ezra 8 : 15-18), and sent for the priests of the Lord. As soon as the priest had arrived, Ezra pro-ceeded as follows:Š " Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath are against all them that forsake him. So we fasted and be-sought our God for this; and he was intreated of us." Ezra 8 : 21-23. The result is told in the following words:Š " Then we departed from the river of Ahava, on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way." -Verse 31. This is our text. The application is plain. Ezra says: "I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him." Ezra felt that if he should ask the king for pro-tection, it would be virtually a denial of his faith. The Jews had told the heathen of the power of Jehovah, no doubt quoting the words of Moses: " There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms." And now if Ezra should ask kingly protection, the heathen would say, Where is your God? If he is so powerful, why do you not depend upon him, instead of seeking the protection of an earthly monarch ? Such questions would have been well put. Ezra knew it; he knew that to ask for protection from the king would be to proclaim the weak-ness of Israel. The same principles will apply to-day. The Christian religion is from God. Christ, its founder, said that he spoke only the words of God. He said also, " My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence." John 18 : 36. If Christians in the nineteenth century, contrary to the pre-cept and example of their leader, appeal to force, they simply proclaim their lack of faith in' God. The National Reformers will, it is true, disclaim any design to appeal to force in support of Christianity; but laws are for noth-ing, if they are not to be enforced. No custom is made legal, unless it is desired to enforce that custom. To " enforce " means to support by force. And therefore when Christian usages are placed on a legal basis in the fundamental law of the land, it is nothing else than an ap- peal to force of arms, if necessary, to support those usages when they are violated. But such an appeal to force would be a virtual proclama-tion that God had departed from those making the appeal. It would be a confession of one of two things: Either that the ones making the appeal had no faith in God's power to care for his own cause, or else that the customs in whose support civil authority was invoked, did not have the support of divine authority. It is just as plain now as it was in the days of Ezra, that religion is lowered in the eyes of the world, when civil power is invoked in its behalf. To place Christian institutions on a legal basis in the law of the land, would be to put them on a level with human institutions. Therefore it is in the interest of religion that we oppose this proposed Constitutional Amendment. As Chris-tians we do not want to see any institution or usage that is really Christian, and which there-fore bears the divine impress, sunk to the level of " a police regulation." Christian institutions have the support of God, and therefore do not need the support of the State; and if the in-stitutions which it is proposed to enforce are not really Christian, then certainly Christians should condemn the movement. E. J. W. Morality and Religion. THE Christian religion, as we have said on this subject, is a remedial system. If man had not sinned, such a system would not have ex-isted. Man would then have been justified by his obedience. The commandments of God contain the whole duty of man. Eccl. 12: 13, 14. His law is perfect. Ps. 9 : 7. His commandments are righteousness. Ps. 119 : 172. Hence, if man had not sinned he would have done his whole duty; he would have been per-fect and righteous in complete obedience to a perfect and righteous law. He could not have been condemned, because all his actions would have been right. And thus it is written, " The doers of the law shall be justified." Rom. 2:13. And we have said the law, in every part, grew out of the will of God alone; it arose from no contingency connected with man's probation. It is original obligation, all its relations existing by virtue of creation. And as it is perfect, and contains the whole duty of man, it is a com-plete summary of all morality. From the day that man first owed allegiance to his Creator, and duties to his fellow-creatures, no new mo-rality has arisen either in principle or in pre-cept. There is no just reason for the expres-sion which we have often heard, " The moral laws of the gospel." If any morality exists by virtue of the gospel, that fact would prove that the moral law previously existing was imper-fect; that it did not contain all morality, and therefore did not contain the whole duty of moral agents. The necessity for the gospel originated in man's transgression; but man's transgression could not possibly give rise to moral obligation. It did create a necessity for a system of redemption, of restoration, but all the laws of such a system areŠwhat theolo-gians correctly termŠpositive laws, in distinc-tion from moral. This is a truth of which sight is too often lost, though the distinction itself is almost uni-
