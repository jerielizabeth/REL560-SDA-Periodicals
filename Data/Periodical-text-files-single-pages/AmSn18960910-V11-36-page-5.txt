 StMEMBER 10, 1896.             livings. The advertisements usually make a central point of the advanced age of the present incumbent. This, of course, is a most important fact for a pur-chaser; for no one desires to invest money in a living when he may have to wait twenty years before he can present to it. A living is not a marketable property unless the incumbent is advanced in life, and the va-cancy may be expected at an early date. The adver-tisements also describe the character of the Church service, whether it is High or Low. High Church livings are in greatest demand, and it is always important for a prospective rector or vicar to know the character in this respect of the parish to which he is going. If the incumbent he is to replace has been a Low Churchman, the church wardens will be Low Churchmen too. They stay on after the old incumbent is gone, and may give trouble to a new in-cumbent of High Church tendencies. The age of the incumbent and the character of the service having been stated, there usually comes in these advertise-ments of advowsons for sale a glowing description of the parish and the surrounding country. The society of the neighborhood comes in for some notice, and oftentimes stress is laid on the fact that the fishing in the neighborhood is good, and that a pack of hounds meets a few miles away. Occasionally emphasis is laid on the fact that there are no dissenters in the parishŠno Wesleyans, Congregationalists or Baptists; and that there is no school board. For years past, sincere and earnest Churchmen have been shocked at the open manner in which the brokerage and auctioneering of church livings have been carried on. The Cranborne Bill is one of several efforts which have been made to regulate and check the sales. education, and, most of all, their religion, and beget in his soul the reverence and love with which they cherished the time-honored traditions of their forefathers. This done, we will see that, in the times of which we speak, all the world embraced the teachings of the Catholic Church. King and subject, prince and peasant, rich and poor, priest and people, all believed her doctrines not only to be true, but incapable of being false. Schools and churches, assemblies and meeting-houses, echoed and re-echoed with her tenets and dogmas. And so, quite naturally, it seemed to all who lived in such surroundings, and rightly too, that anyone who sought to de-stroy the faith of a nation, which is at all times its most priceless treasure, was as great an enemy to the State as one who contrived to undermine its civil institutions. Moreover, since all statesmen and public officers were at the same time Catholics, it is most easy to understand that they enacted laws and punishments in keeping with their religious convictions. To put it briefly, in those Middle Ages, there was the greatest union of Church and State. This union was the natural outcome of the beautiful marriage of civil and religious institutions. The State then, as it should now, protected and defended her holy bride from danger and persecution: the church softened the might and impetu-osity of her sterner companion with gentle-ness and mercy. The State made enactments and laws for the government of its citizens; the church inspired and seasoned them with justice and wisdom. All the laws then, had a tinge of Catholicity, and they were carried out in a manner savoring of the principles of that universal religion. Consequently, it is evident, that one who was a heretic then, was by that very fact in opposition to the spirit of the laws and customs of his countryŠin other words, a disturber of the public peace, and an ttnderminer of civil society. And so it was that in the year 1184, when Tucius HI. sat upon the throne of Peter, the Roman Inquisition was formally established to bring to trial the Cathari [the Albigenses]. And at the same time bishops established special tribunals in different places, to examine into the charges against other persons who were suspected or known to be heretics. But the Inquisition was not fully estab-lished until in 1248, Innocent IV. took the tribunal out of the hands of the seculars, and turned it over to the Dominicans who had done great work in converting the Cathari. The Dominicans, according to their mission, introduced the Inquisition into all countries and diligently sifted out and indicted heretics of every description. There were three classes of heretics, and three were the kinds of punishment meted out to them. The first class were the Jews, who were punished very lightly; the second class were the ordinary heretics, who were condemned to banishment or. else imprisoned; the third class, however, those heretics who were at the same time open disturbers of the peace, and enemies to society, were punished. to the full extent of the law. The church could suffer the pagans to worship because they erred from ignorance; she could tolerate the Jews because they were the living and most singular witnesses to the truth; but never could she countenance or encourage a formal heretic, a foe to civilization, a barrier in the way to salvation, to scatter his poisons unmolested. But aside from the question of civil society, was the church justified in punish-ing heretics for that reason alone ? Most as-suredly. The church is the divinely ap-pointed guardian of the revelations of Jesus Christ, and consequently has the right to rebuke those who, in any: way, attack the purity of that faith. Besides, every one will admit that any society, has the right to impose certain obligations ,upon its members and to reprimand and, punish; and even ex-clude them from membership, if they do not comply with these duties. , If, then, any so-ciety, no matter what may be its nature and aim, is free from blame in so doing, a fortiori, it was not only not unjust but even obligatory and praiseworthy for the Catholic Church, which has been entrusted with the teachings of the Spirit of Truth, to exclude from within her sacred fold the wolves who sought to prey upon the innocent lambsi.which she sheltered and guarded therein. Fpw, very few, are the charges brought against the Roman In-quisition;Šit seems as .though mankind has ever acknowledged the justice of its punish-ments. But when the Spanishanquisition is spoken of, then Protestantism trembles, her knees quake, her lips falter,And—Ła sickly pallor rushes to her countenance. is All the chican-ery of popery, all the secrecy" of the confess-ional, all the darkness of deep4aid conspiracy, all the intolerance and oppression and perse-cution and religious thralldom of Romanism, are embodied in that dread:: word. Books have been written, libraries' filled, talents misused, energies wasted; to:,,picture the im-aginary horrors of this wicked;'marble-hearted tribunal. The cannons,  roar, the dungeons ring with the curses and groans of the de-spairing imprisoned,,the =streets are flooded, and the executioner's axe is red with the blood of innocent victims. As to the truth of these accusations, the faintest knowledge of history 'will show that they are either Altogether false and malicious, or else if, true, exaggerated and multipliedŠthe sure outcome 9-f prejudice and envy. Before however I undertake, to refute any of these charges, it is my purpose, most of all, to impress upon the minds of my readers, that the Spanish InquiSition was, an entirely royal tribunal, and that, consequently, were the charges as " high as high Olympus," they could not cloud the glories of Catholic-ity. And, as in our justification of the Ro-man Inquisition, we relied much and drew great sustenance from the .eustoms of the peoples who established and were ruled by it; so now, in our defence of the $panish Inquisi-tion, must we, no less :than before, again fall back upon the manners and, usage of the epoch in which it flourished. In those ages of faith, as from what has been said before will be easily understood, it was well-nigh impossible for a Jew or Infidel' to ascend to prominence in any walk of life. And 'thus prescription of the Jews was : dominant not only in Spain, but in . the other Christian countries as well; and resulted, in the me-diseval era, as in our own, froth the intense feeling which Christians had against the Jews, who were looked upon as the ac-cursed race which had persecuted, mocked, and crucified JesiS Christ, whom they as Chris-tians, adored as the Son of God, the Redeemer of the World, and the founder and preserver of their holy religion. Statesmen and war-riors, grandees and noblemen,, harboring and and cherishing dispositions such as these, would have as their friends and; companions only those who were of their own faith. This was most galling to the avaricious Jew, and numbers of them, thirsting for wealth, while secretly remaining Jews, pretended to profess the Catholic faith, were baptized, pushed into the courts and kingly palaces, became holders of large estates, and even were found among the priests and prelates of the church of God. In this hidden, underhand manner, they were It is only the spirit of the Reformation, which obtained such a strong hold upon the liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons, that has pre-vented England from reaping the more bale-ful fruits of this essentially papal system. s.   THE INQUISITION.  Its Nature Misunderstood by Many Bigoted Protestants.  BY JAMES A. CONWAY. [Written for the CATHOLIC MIRROR.] [This article is from the Catholic Mirror of August 29. We print it entire for the information of our readers. For editorial comment see our first page article, "Rome Defends the Inquisition."ŠEDITOR SENTINEL.] In these closing days of the nineteenth century when every wind brings news of dis-covery, and when every word that falls from the lips of humanity adds a gem to the crown bestowed on modern progress, the atheist, the infidel, the heretic, impelled by religious prejudice or blinded by ignorance, still points a finger of scorn at the medieval ages when the church of Christ ruled with the scepter of faith the civilized world. Many are the charges brought against 'the peoples of those times, which, if true, must have made those ages sad indeed. Foremost among -these charges, most grievous in its nature, and most ready to the tongue of every opponent of Catholicity, is the Inquisition, which we have in purpose to examine. His-tory divides the Inquisition into two distinct tribunals: the Roman Inquisition, and the Inquisition of the Spanish Government. Great care must be taken not to confound the two; one is purely ecclesiastical, the other strictly secular. The one was undertaken and must be, defended from a religious stand-point; the other was established and per-petuated by the civil government, and must lean for its justification on national rights and privileges. But to give a fair, unbiased judgment upon either, one must set truth in one eye, and personal disadvantage in the other, and look upon both indifferently. He must identify himself with the customs, hab-its, and opinions of the people who lived in those ages; he must take into account their
