___Ececor=                               Webster's Bicentennial Oration on Landing of the Pilgrims                       WE have come to this rock to re-cord here our homage for our Pilgrim Fathers, our sympathy in their sufferings, our gratitude for their labors, our admiration of their vir- tues, our veneration for their piety, and our attachment to those principles of civil and religious liberty which they encountered the dangers of the ocean, the storms of heaven, the violence of savages, disease, exile, and famine, to en-joy and to establish. And we would leave here, also, for the generations which are rising up. rapidly to fill our places, some proof that we have endeavored to transmit the great inheritance unimpaired; that in our estimate of public principles and private virtue, in our vener-ation of religion and piety, in our devotion to civil and religious liberty, in our regard to what-ever advances human knowledge or improves hu-man happiness, we are not altogether unworthy o f our origin. The love of religious lib-erty is a stronger sentiment when fully excited, than an attachment to civil or po-litical freedom. That free-dom which the conscience demands, and which men feel bound by their hopes of salvation to contend for, can hardly fail to be attained. Conscience in the cause of religion, and the worship of Deity, prepares the mind to act, and to suffer beyond almost all other causes. Histoiy instructs us that this love of religious lib-erty, a compound sentiment in the breast of man, made up of the clearest sense of  right and the highest conviction of duty, is able to look the sternest despotism in the face, and with means apparently most inadequate, to shake principalities and powers. There is a boldness, a spirit of daring, in religious reformers, not to be meas-ured by the general rules which control men's purposes and ac-tions. If the hand of power be laid upon it, this only seems to augment its force and its elas-ticity, and to cause its action to be more formidable and terrible. Human invention has devised nothing, human power has com-passed nothing, that can forcibly restrain it, when it breaks forth. Nothing can stop it, but to give way to it; nothing can check it, but indulgence. It loses its pow-er only when it has gained its object. If it be allowed indul-gence and expansion, like the elemental fires it only agitates a n d perhaps purifies the atmosphere, while its efforts to throw off restraint would burst the world asunder. Thanks be to God, that this spot was hon-ored as the asylum of religious liberty. May its standard, reared here, remain for- ever ! May it rise up high as heaven, till its banner shall fan the air of both continents, and wave as a glorious ensign of peace and security to the nations ! The true principle of a free and popu-lar government would seem to be so to construct it as to give all, or at least to a very great majority, an interest in its preservation : to found it as other things 107 The Pilgrim Memorial Monu- ment, Provincetown, Mass.
