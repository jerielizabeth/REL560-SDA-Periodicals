INTERIOR VIEW OF JEFFERSON'S HOME LIBERTY From the highest view-point Bancroft, in his history of the United States, has well expressed the object of the Ameri-can system of government : " Vindicating the right of individuality in religion, and in religion above all, the new nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relations to God the principle first divinely ordained of God in Judea.
