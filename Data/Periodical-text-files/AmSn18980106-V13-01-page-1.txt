IT is the object of the civil law to keep men civil; but when a person undertakes to make men moral by civil law, he himself becomes most uncivil.

Toe church should remember that when she is joined with one of the powers of earth, it will be proper for her to change her name. If, she wishes to retain her name, she must remain single. The "Infallible" State. IT the late National Reform convention in Philadel-phia, Rev. David McAllister, a leading exponent of National Reform ideas, spoke of the state as being "the infallible interpreter of and the active agent in applying moral law." This he said was the conception and aim of the National Reform movement. Let us look for a moment at this "infallible" state. Where shall we find it? Where is there any record of one, or where is there one that claims to he infallible at the present time? There is none ; but Dr. McAllister doubtless does not claim that there ever was an infallible state or even that there is one in existence now. Yet the National Reform idea is that the ktate is to become "the infallible inter- , preter" of moral law. But how is the state to become infallible? If it never was infallible in the past. and is not infallible now, how is it to acquire infallibility in the future? Is it to acquire this by being made the "interpreier of and active agent in applying moral law"?
