AND LITTLE FOLKS' BIBLE GALLERY One of these books contains 44 and the other 45 full page illustrations besides the BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED COLORED COVERS. Children are delighted with both the pictures and the stories, which even the little " tots " can under-stand by the help of the pictures. A mother who has used these books in her family, says:Š Who that has the care of little children, does not realize the value of healthful pictures and stories ? And who has not found that of all others, they love most those obtained from the Bible ? " Yes,"you say, "we have been searching this long time, but books for children all have so many objections." Then you have not found the companion books, " Bible Pictures and Stories," and " Little Folks Bible Gallery," written by Jennie B. Merrill. Really it is a pity that any little child should not have the privilege of seeing these beautiful full-page pictures and of hearing the well-told story. MRS. T. A. KILGoRE.

We have secured the following books which we can recommend, not only as unobjectionable but as highly beneficial reading for young men:Š Moral Muscle and How to Use It, by FRED-ERICK ATKINS. A Brotherly Chat with Yonng Men. "This is positively the best book for young men that we have seen. It looks the facts of young men's lives full in the face, and proclaims the gospel of industry, perseverance, self-cou-trol, and manly Christianity. We can certify that no one will find it stupid."ŠSt. Andrews Cross. First Battles and How to Fight Them, by F. A. ATKINS. Friendly Chats with Young Men. "It is true in substance, attractive in its style, and admira-ble in its spirit. I heartily commend this little volume."ŠRev. John Hall, D.D. The Spiritual Athlete and How He Trains, by W. A. BODELL. Introduction by REV. B. FAY MILLS. A work for young men, pithy, pointed and practical. " Its power and value lie in the consistent carrying out of the comparison between physical and spiritual training."ŠThe Independent. Brave and True, by J. TRAIN DAVIDSON. Talks to Young Men. " This is one of the books the wide distribution of which cannot be too greatly desired."ŠPresbyterian. Journal. Each of these books is complete in itself, and so can be sold separately at fifty cents each; but as they are all about equally good, and desiring to encourage the dissemination of such literature, we offer the four for $1.75. They are all bound alike, and put up in a neat box present a very at-tractive appearance. They will form a valuable addition to any young man's or youth's library. FATHERS OF THE CAAFT-TOIL4IC BY E. J. WAGGONER. History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the princi-ples of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adop-tion of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of pa-ganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY. is alone worth the price of the book. Fine English cloth,sub,  stantially bound, contains about 400 pages, and will be sent post-paid for $1.00.
