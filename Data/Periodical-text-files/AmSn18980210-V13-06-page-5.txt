So, as a test by which to decide whether Christ was' really the Messiah, or, not, they demanded of hint to, tell them when he,woulcl reinstate the kingdom Of God among them-, His answerrwas clear and decisive: "The kingdom of God cometh not with ob-servation [margin,' outward show]; neither shall they say; Lo, here! or, lo, there ! for, behold, the, kingdom .of God is within you." Luke 17:20,21. In other words, the outward form. of God's government on earth is lost. It will not return in that shape; but must, for the time, be established within you, and your bodily members be-come wholly subject to God's will from the heart, even though your territory be ruled over by a foreign power. The earthly part of God's kingdom having been sep-arated from the government of heaven;  the way was then opened by which men might signify their loyalty to God, even thOugh living in the territory of a hostile govern-ment. To show the nature of this arrangement, let us study the following diagram:-= p.ph  00  ra-P toy; a Wf. of. —earth, hence !mist count, himself a; "pilgrim and stranger" in a foreign1414411 alieniroM theCOMMOn- wealths of earth, to be loOking Whielilath foundations,-  Whekie Wilder and maker is God."

As this temporary kingdom grew out of, and runs 'parallel with, the kingdom first given:to man,,,but now usurped by Satan, so when, that territory isi,  stored to its first condition, the two, will be inergedinto one perfect, state, and those who. have been subjects of the kingdom of grace will then be subjects of Łthat perfect and, eternal reign of righteousness. , This, is,  clearly shown in the following words of the Saviour: ."Then shall, the king say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye ,hlessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared 'for youifrom the foundation of the world." Matt. 25:34.  Then the kingdom which was ;prepared for manat the foundation of the, world; which was givento him, and passed over to the 'control = of, Sata,p, will have been re-deemed by Christ and restored ,to man, who will again "reign upon the earth," as at the beginning.

BY ISAAC MORRISON.               God's reign of grace In the human heart.  The upper horizontal line will represent the kingdom over which man was given dominion at the beginning (Gen. 1:26), and which, upon the entrance of sin, became subject to the rule of Satan. Man being born upon this usurped territory, is by nature a slave of sin, but is in-vited by the gospel of Christ to renounce the service of Satan, and yield allegiance to the king of heaven. But inasmuch as the territory under which men are born is detached from the kingdom of heaven, and must remain a part of the realm of wickedness until sin is destroyed out of it, an arrangement has been made by which man may connect with that part of the kingdom of heaven that remains steadfast, including the King, his throne, , and his law, these to be enshrined in the heart. This, of course, constitutes him a subject of that kingdom which reigns within. The lost territory, however, cannot be received thus, but must be waited for until it also is cleansed from sin, when it will be restored to its original domain, and so the kingdom of God be again united in its original perfect state. This reign of God in the heart is known as the king-dom of grace (Heb. 4:16'), and has run parallel with earthly kingdoms ever since the fall of man. It is indi-cated in the diagram by the lower horizontal line. Grow-ing out of man's necessity for a purer and more satisfying government than that in which fate has placed him by birth, it stands in the place of the lost territory until that territory can be restored to the reign of heaven. Whoever, therefore, becomes an "adopted" citizen of this kingdom of grace is "called out," in heart, from the rule o MR.
