LIBERTY ber 30 referred to the recent service at St. Patrick's Church, as follows :Š The only official celebration of Thanksgiving will occur at St. Patrick's Church this morning at eleven o'clock, where the third Pan-American Thanks-giving-day service will be held. Presi-dent Taft, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Interior Fisher, Chief Justice White of the United States Supreme Court, Justice McKenna, and representatives of all the Latin-Amer-ican countries, will be in attendance.  brated at St. Patrick's Church yesterday morning in the presence of President Taft, members of his Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, members of both houses of Congress, the diplomatic rep-resentatives of twenty Latin-American republics and other countries, and mem-bers of official and resident society, could not have been more beautiful and impressive. It goes without saying that the Pres-ident and other officials have the un-doubted individual right to attend any ('RESIDENT AND MRS. TAFT LEAVING ST. PATRICK'S AFTER THE MASS Cardinal Gibbons will assist at the mass. And, impressed with the pomp and circumstance of the incident, the same paper on December I commented as follows : Š If the state and the church were united in this country, the pomp and cir-cumstance with which the third Pan-American Thanksgiving mass was cele- religious service they may choose. But, as we see it, when these officials take part in a pan-American service created by, and held under the auspices of, the Roman Catholic or any other church, they do so in an official and representa-tive character. We believe this practise to be open to serious objection, in the light of the American principle of the separation of church and state. s. B. H.
