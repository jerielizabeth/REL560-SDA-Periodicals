ID LIBERTY times in history, that when the church abandons the work of preaching the sim-ple gospel according to the instruction of the great commission, and attempts to accomplish even results desirable in themselves, by alliance with the civil power, she forfeits that which alone can make her work successful,Š the presence of her divine Lord,Š and becomes her-self a mere human organization with only human power for the accomplish-ment of her ends. The American Church and the American Sabbath IN another article in this department, under the title, " A Dangerous Combi-nation," some facts are stated concern-ing the Federal Council of Churches, an organization which the Philadelphia North American regards as a demonstra-tion of the fact that " there is what may be actually called an American church, a consolidated Protestant church of the United States." In this article we pur-pose to set forth the action taken by this Federal Council concerning Sunday ob-servance, and to point out the signifi- cance of that action. The resolutions reported by the com-mittee on Sunday observance, and adopted by the council, read as fol- lows : Š It is the sense of the council that a new and stronger emphasis should be given in the pulpit, the Sunday-school, and the home to the Scriptural observ-ance of the first clay of the week as the sacred day, the home day, the rest day, for every man, woman, and child. That all encroachments upon the claims and sanctities of the Lord's day should be stoutly resisted through the press, the Lord's Day Associations and Alliances, and by such legislation as may be secured to protect and preserve this bulwark of our American Chris-tianity. That we rejoice in the prospect of unity  of action among the various organiza-tions striving in America for the preser-vation of the Lord's day as a day for rest and worship. Although we are strongly of the opin-ion that there is no Scriptural authority for the first day of the week as the Sab-bath, yet we freely grant to those who entertain a contrary view the fullest right to teach their doctrine in their pulpits, their Sunday-schools, and their homes, and the same privilege which we concede to others we claim for ourselves; namely, the right to present publicly and privately what we understand to be the teaching of the Scriptures upon this subject. If the committee had confined its report to this one recommendation, there would be no occasion for a protest, and this article would never have been written. It becomes evident at once that as soon as an attempt is made to resist "all encroachments upon the claims and sanc-tities of the Lord's day," the necessity arises of determining definitely which is the Lord's day. It is well known that there is a division, even among professed Christians, over this question, some main-taining that the original commandment requiring the observance of the seventh day of the week has never been an-nulled, and that there is no divine author-ity for substituting any other day in its place. Moreover, there were delegates in the council itself, representing a Chris-tian body of believers (the Seventh-day Baptists), who not only acknowledge the propriety of keeping the seventh day, but do themselves actually observe that day as the Sabbath. For the council to place it-self on record as derrianding legislation which would enforce upon all at least an outward observance of the first day of the week, while one of their own constituent bodies conscientiously rests on the sev-enth day, was an exhibition of Christian unity not contemplated under the pro-gram, and led to a protest which took
