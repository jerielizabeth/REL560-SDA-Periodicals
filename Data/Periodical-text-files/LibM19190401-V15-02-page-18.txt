Religious tyranny always reverses this method. Respect for Government Respect for government is secured by even-handed justice to all classes rather than by hasty and severe repression of some particular class. When government functions are used to support and promote wealth, when predatory in-terests Š organized freebooters Š prey at will upon the mass of the people, government is bound to lose the respect of the classes oppressed. And this is true of any class, social, religious, or political. A Sunday law divides the people into two classes, a favored class who support the law, and just as truly an honest and patriotic class who oppose it because it should have no place in legislation. When the flag of our country is made to stand for class favoritism and oppression, it loses its glorious symbolism, and is bound to become a matter of jest and jeer, of contumely and contempt. The object of government in the words of Jefferson is, " Equal and exact justice to all men, of  whatever state or persuasion, religious or po-litical." The man who works for a Sunday law is jeopardizing his own liberty. He may be suc-cessful and put upon the statute books a law as stringent as the Georgia statute, which, according to the courts of that State, makes it unlawful even for a woman to sew on that day in the privacy of her own home. After having accomplished this, he may wish to become a seventh-day observer, and under such circum-stances, could not afford to observe two days; he would find it necessary to employ Sunday in proper, legitimate labor. But in this he would find himself hampered, limited, made a criminal, by his own law. He would find that he had by his human unwisdom in a decided way limited his own freedom. But men will not change. They do not know. Saul of Tarsus found that it was " hard to kick against the goads," and changed his course in harmony with God's way. From his exceeding madness against heretics, he came to that state of mind in which he thus expresses the ruling principle of his life: "For the love of Christ constrain-
