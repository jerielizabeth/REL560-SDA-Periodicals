A MESSAGE OF THE PAST THAT IS A MESSAGE FOR THE PRESENT . Abraham Lincoln in a letter to the Republicans of Boston, April, 1859, written for the occasion of the celebration of the birthday of Thomas Jefferson. But soberly, it is now no child's play to save the principles of Jefferson from total overthrow in this nation. One would state with great confidence that he could convince any sane child that the simpler propositions of Euclid are true; but, nevertheless, he would fail with one who should deny the definitions and axioms. The principles ofJeferson are the definitions and axioms of free society. And yet they are denied and evaded with no small show of success-.  One dashingly calls them "glittering generali-ties." Another bluntly styles them "self-evident lies." And others insidiously argue that they apply only to "superior races." The expressions, differing in form, are identical in object and effectÑthe supplanting the principles of free government, and restoring those of classification, caste, and legitimacy. They would delight a convocation of crowned heads plotting against the people. They are the vanguard, the sappers and miners of returning despotism. We must repulse them, or they will subjugate us. This is a world of compensation ; and he who would BE no slave must consent to HAVE no slave. Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, cannot long retain it. All honor to JeffersonÑthe man who in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people had the coolness, foresight, and capacity to introduce into a merely revolu-tionary document an abstract truth applicable to all men and all times, and so to embalm it there, that to-day, and in all coming days, it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling-block to the harbingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression !
