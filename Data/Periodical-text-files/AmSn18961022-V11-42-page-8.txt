336 A.IVICIEMCA.N V 0L. 11, No. 42. NEW YORK, OCTOBER 22, 1896. lar" ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. -UNLESS all signs fail the coming year will witness the most vigorous "reform" cam-paign, so-called, that the world has ever seen. The. National Reform Association long since fossilized, but its work has been taken up and is being carried on by younger, abler, and more practical organizations, prominent among which is the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor. THE International International Religious Liberty Asso-ciation is arranging with local organizations in the various States to send the AMERICAN SENTINEL to the members of legislatures and State officials in every State and Territory in the Union; while the Association itself will send the paper to the members of Congress. Those who are not already members of the Association and who wish to aid in this work as well as in other lines of work which the Association is carrying forward, can give sub-stantial assistance by sending their names with one dollar to the Secretary, A. F. Bal-lenger, 39 Bond St., New York, and thus become members of the Association. MENTION was made in these columns some weeks ago of the arrest of Robert Morehead, a colored Seventh-day Adventist of Greens-boro, N. C., for working on Sunday. He was bound over to the Superior Court, but before the sitting of that court the principal witness who was wanted by the sheriff on a criminal charge, left for parts unknown. As a necessary consequence the case against Morehead had to be abandoned. Thus far every case of this kind in North Carolina has terminated favorably for the defense. The better part of the community about Greens-boro are disgusted with the efforts of some to use the " law" to persecute honest peo-ple for conscience' sake. One of the best lawyers in the county had volunteered to de-fend Morehead free of charge, and would have done so had the case come to trial. "Jun' recently the professedly Protestant Church authorities in Constantinople," says a London. paper, " called the attention of the Turkish authorities to the growth of the work of Seventh-day Adventists in Turkey, asking that it might be suppressed. The result was that the request was refused and the work and lives of our friends there spoken of com-mendably. In every case where our workers have suffered physical violence in Turkey it has been at the hands of professed Christians.  The various sects fight among themselves and accuse one another to the authorities. Is it any wonder that Mohammedans have a poor idea of Christians generally? It shows the need of gospel work in Turkey to show pro-fessed Christians and Turks alike that the Christianity of Christ means a life of honesty and sobriety and obedience to God's law." " THE antiquated idea that the preacher must keep out of politics," is a phrase heard often at this time from the lips of clergymen and other speakers at religious gatherings, and with an emphasis intended to cover the idea with ridicule and contempt. Having listened to this the ear is almost prepared to hear from similar sources about the "anti-quated idea" that the church ought not to direct in political matters, or that men ought not to be sent to the dungeon and the stake for setting the decrees of the church at naught? Certain it is that the present ten-dency is to renounce as antiquated and worn out those very principles which the Chris-tians and patriots of former times established at the price of their liberty and their lives. It is a very easy task, requiring but a few thoughtless moments, to surrender the birth-right blessings which years of toil and suffer-ing were required to secure. BY a recent decision of the courts in South Carolina, it is held to be- unlawful to con- duct railway traffic on Sunday. An ex- ception was, however, made- in favor of a trainload of delegates to the centennial cele-bration of the A. M. E. Zion Church, held October 18. This was at the request of the manager of the meeting, Rev. E. Morton, of Rock Hill, S. C., made 'by letter to Mr. D. P. Duncan, Secretary Railroad Commis-sion. Mr. Duncan replied that if the excur-sion train referred to "is to be strictly a train run for religious purposes, the commission will not object to the train run on the 18th of October." The Sunday "law" in South Carolina, as in other States, has its origin and present support in religious sentiment; and the easy dissipation of that sentiment, for the time being, before a prospective hardship which it would bring upon those holding it, shows that it is really selfish, and not Christian in character. THE article on page 332, by A. F. Ballen-ger, should be carefully read by every one, in connection with our first-page article. This " Christian Citizenship" movement has suddenly developed into a young Hercules and is exerting its immense strength in an effort to subordinate the political institutions of the country to the dictation of " the church." This movement can result in nothing short of a fully developed image of the Roman Papacy. It is only a question, as we have often logically demonstrated, of one pope or  a number of popes, a composite pope as it were. Under the papal scheme a single man interposes himself between God and the in-dividual, and speaks for Him, thus flitting "in the temple of God showing himself that he is God ; " while under the Young People's " Christian " Endeavor National Reform 'scheme, a number of men acting together do exactly the same thing. The principle is the same; the one is the papacy, the other is the image of the papacy. And this is not mere theory of what may some day be. Already the churches of the United States have assumed to dictate to the State, and the StateŠthe GovernmentŠhas heard and obeyed. By petition, by resolu-tions, by threats of political boycott, and by all the arts known to the American papacy, the composite "Protestant" pope declared to the Government of the United States that Sunday is the Sabbath; that it is enforced by the fourth commandment, and that it is the duty of the State to recognize this fact, and to require all men to recognize it. The State heard and obeyed by enacting the World's Fair Sunday legislation, and in various other ways; and now this "Protestant" pope boasts that the churches will presently have the politicians at their feet and the G" qrnment so well in hand, so entirely uncle. their con-trol, that they can get anything they ask for. " CIVIL Grounds of Religious Intolerance," No. 38 of the Religious Liberty Library (illustrated). This tract shows that the same arguments urged to-day in justification of " civil" laws restricting' the rights of con-science in this country have been used in every age and in various countries, in defense of religious intolerance. A striking parallel is also shown between " civil" grounds of religious intolerance in Russia and in the United, States at the present time. It is a pointed and forcible presentation of the sub-ject under discussion, and should be read by everybody. Eight pages, price one cent.
