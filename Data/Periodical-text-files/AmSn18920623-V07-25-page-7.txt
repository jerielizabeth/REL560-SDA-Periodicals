THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 199 der, and why he should attack me I am at a loss to understand. If his motives are not political, what are they ? I am a Democrat; my predecessor, Chief Murphy, is a Republican. I have been in charge of the Police Department only a short time; Chief Murphy was at the head of it for many years, Did Dr. Scudder ever attack Chief Murphy for not enforcing the law ? Perhaps the good Doctor is not aware of the fact that the Sunday law is being more strictly enforced than in a great many years. When Dr. Scudder came to this benighted city from the far West, and took upon himself the task of snaking it good and Republican at the same time, he could discover wickedness only in depart-ments controlled by Democrats. " ' I have this proposition to make to Dr. Scudder: If he will bring me a letter from Mayor Wanser directing that the Sunday law be, more rigidly en-forced than it is now, I will guarantee that not a saloon in this city will be open even the least little bit. " ' Heretofore when the city had a Democratic Mayor and the Democrats had a majority in the Po-,  lice Board, the responsibility for not rigidly enforc-ing the Sunday was thrown upon the Mayor and the Commissioners. Now that there is a Republican Mayor, why should Dr. Scudder try to fix the sole responsibility upon me ? It looks as if there might be some politics in it aside from the desire to con-serve the public morals.' " UNDER the head of "The Law Defied," the Wo-man's Voice, of May 14, has the following :- On Sunday, May 7, St. Joseph's Cathedral of Hartford was dedicated. The Romanists asked that special trains be run for their accommodation. The New York, New Haven and Hartford road refused to apply to the railroad commissioners for permission to run trains, the Sunday railroad law not permitting the running of any trains between 10.30 A. II& and 3 P. its., except to meet demands created by the public necessity or in the interests of mercy. Mr. Noonan, local Superintendent of the New England road, made application a week ago to the commissioners for a permit to run special trains for. the accommodation of visitors to the dedication. The commissioners refused the request, but Mr. Noonan announced that three special trains would be run between Waterbury and Hart-ford, within the prohibited hours. The penalty is two hundred and fifty dollars for each offense. We doubt whether such a defiance of law would have been permitted had Protestants been the ag-gressors. The impudence of Romanists in making such a demand contrary to law, shows how sure they are of their power. Consistency in the observance of Sunday does not exist any more within the Church than with-out; and such an incident as this should convince some of the truth of that fact, and of the conse- quent inutility of Sunday laws. the following publications, and charge to No. Copies wanted No.  1.

ESTABLISHED IN 1881. A CANADIAN daily paper remarks that " the fining of a Jew or two in Toronto recently for working on Sunday would seem likely to raise a question of much importance and much difficulty. Some Christians, like the Jews, keep Saturday as a holy day and would work on Sunday if they were not subject to penalties. Why should they be ? Why should the laws recognize the opinions of any ecclesiastical authority or set of authorities as to which, Saturday or Sunday, is the divinely ap-pointed day of rest ? " The question is entirely pertinent. There is ab-solutely no good reason for such regulations, but very many reasons why there should be nothing of the kind. " The Prohibition Party and Freedom of Conscience" No. 49 of the " Sentinel Library," is just the thing to circulate during the political campaign. It sets forth clearly the proper sphere of civil gov-ernment, and can not fail to fix the attention of candid, thinking people. Eight pages; price, one cent; usual discount in large quantities.
