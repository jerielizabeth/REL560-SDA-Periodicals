A., Rector Christ Church, Los Angeles. Cal. The above is the title of a treatise Written by the author at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a dis-cussion upon the present aspect and aims of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as th. Papacy, or Vaticanism, is outlined in the prophecies of Holy Scriptures with sufficient accuracy to determine what the "Papacy" is, and what is to be its future devel-opment and ultimate end.
