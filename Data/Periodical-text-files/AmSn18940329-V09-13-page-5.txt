MARCH t9, 1894. AMMitICAN'  101 of this act shall be a fine of not less than ten dollars for the first offense; for second or subsequent offenses, a fine not exceeding fifty dollars and imprisonment for not less t A ten nor more than thirty days, and Pne year's forfeiture of license, if any is held by the Offender or his employer. SEG. 3. That this Act shall take effect upon its yassage. This is more distinctively and openly a religious bill than the measure for the enforcement of the observance of Sunday, in the District of Columbia, introduced in the previous Congresses by W. C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky. It would seem that the mantle of Mr. Breckinridge has fallen upon Representative Morse, for he is the only member of the House now devoting himself to the furtherance of legislative religion in Congress. In the Congressional Record of March 9, containing the proceedings of the previ-ous day, is the following discussion which arose out of an item in the appropriation bill for the District of Columbia:Š MR. MORSE. Mr. Chairman, there is one single item in this bill to which I propose to address myself, . On page 26 is the following item: For one new engine-house for No. 2 company, to be located on reservation at intersection of Ohio Avenue, Thirteenth and C Streets northwest. $12,000. Now, Mr. Chairman, I have no earthly objection to the engine-house, or to the $12,000 appropriated for it, but I have a serious objection to the location of this engine-house, for the reason that it wipes out the mission chapel which has been doing great good in this city. I hold in my hand the picture of this mis-sion chapel, which cost the benevolent people of this city nearly $5,000. I have not, Mr, Chairman and gentlemen of the House of Representatives, the slight-est interest in this matter except pro bono publics, I have no interest except such as all good and rigid--minded citizens should have in any benevolent work which is being done in the direction of elevating men .and women in the scale of humanity, elevating men and women to a saving knowledge of God. . . . The new engine-house can be located elsewhere. Since this action has been known, and since this ;appropriation has .been passed by the committee, I have received a number of letters from distinguished ',persons in this city protesting against this mission station being removed or destroyed. I have one here from which I would like to read a brief extract. Washington, D. C.. February 24, 1894. DEAR MR. MORSE:. . . I sincerely trust that the objectionable item in the appropriation bill will be eliminated from the same and that we may be allowed to pursue our work in this neg-lected section of our beautiful city unmolested, or better, helped by every influence for good that can possibly be brought to bear— Yours very sincerely, W. B. ROBINSON, Superintendent Bethany Mission. HON, ELIJAH A. Neese, The Shoreham, City. -Now, I do not ask for the wiping out of the appro-priation. I do not ask that the engine-house shall not be built; but I ask of the committee when this item is reached to accept an amendment to locate the engine-house somewhere else. . . . This mission station which it is proposed to destroy and to wipe out is lo-cated in one of the worst sections of the city. I have attended services there myself on a Sunday night. ,The audience was composed largely of persons who do mat; go to church anywhere else. There were soldiers in the audience ; I should judge there were intemperate persons, from their appearance. I know that the young men who are members of the Young Men's Christian Association, and the members of the Society ‚of Christian Endeavor, have for twenty years been ,conducting services there. They hold religious serv-ices there on Friday and Sunday night and the average attendance, I am told, has been -something like one hundred. On Sabbath afternoon they hold a :Sunday-school, and the average attendance is one !hundred fifteen, Now, it seems to me that it would be exceedingly tinwise, from the lowest standpoint of the financial aspect of the question, to blow out this light, to pull down this moral light-house, stationed in that dark place, even for so laudable a purpose as to locate an engine-house, to put out a different kind of fire. Lail hter, ] . Now, Mr. Chairman, I have no right to detain the House further, As the liokir is late, but I simply desire to send to the clerk's desk and have read in my time a brief statement of the work of this mission, and I have also obtained from the chairman of the Committee on Printing permission to print in the Record a cut show-ing the mission building. I think that it is a very important matter to this city whether this mission is to continue or is to be wipe' out. . . . IV/R. COGSWELL. Do you say that you are going to put that cut in the Record ? . . . Do I understand pay colleague has asked permission to print in the  Record a cut of this Bethel ? I ask that question for information. If he does ask that, I object. MR. MORSE. I will say that I propose to conform entirely to the rules of the House in regard to the mat-ter. MR. COGSWELL. I want to know if the gentleman has asked permission. I understood him to say so; and if so, I have the right to object. THE CHAIRMAN. The chair has submitted no re-quest. If the gentleman will proffer his request, the chair wilt submit it. MR. COGSWELL. My colleague stated a while ago that he submitted at the same time a cut of that Bethel to put in the Record. That sometimes is taken here as unanimous consent, MR. MoRsE, I did not ask consent of the House to illustrate my remarks, but I asked and obtained in writing the consent of the chairman of the Committee on Printing, in conformity to the rule of the House as printed on the last page of the Record. MR. COGSWELL. If he does, I object. MR. MORSE. I will say in regard to this matter, if my colleague fromMassachusetts will read the condtion upon which members are allowed to illustrate their remarks in the Record, he will see that I have complied with those conditions and his objection does not count, and I have a right to insert the illustration in connection with my remark if I choose to do so. I think, how-ever, I shall not insist on my right in view of the ob-jection, as JFdo not want to injure the chance of sus cess of my amendment, and I only wished to use the cut to show what a substantial chapel and mission building it was proposed to wipe out and destroy to make room for an engine-house. MR. COGSWELL. I know that the relations existing between my colleague and the chairman of the Com-mittee on Printing are very pleasant; but I will object to having that cut printed in the Record, if for no other reason, on the constitutional ground that we have no right to recognize religions or the sects thereof. MR. KEM. That is right. THE CHAIRMAN. Objection is Made. The Record 'of March 11 continues the subject thus :Š The clerk read as follows:Š For one new engine house for No. 2 company, to be located  on reservation at intersection of Ohio avenue, thirteenth, and C streets northwest, $12,000. MR. MORSE. Mr. Chairman, I offer the amendment which I send to the desk. The amendment was read, as follows: Strike out the paragraph just read and insert in lieu thereof the following: Ł` For one new engine house for No. 2 company, to be locat d elsewhere than on reservation at intersection of Ohio avenue, Thirteenth, and C streets northwest, $12,000." MR MORSE. Mr. Chairman, in addition to what I said the other day in support of this amendment, I desire to call attention once more to the fact that this proposed new engine house, if it is to be built at the point indicated in the bill, is to be on the present site of a mission station of the New York Avenue Presby-terian Church, That chapel, called the Bethany Mis-sion, was built upon that site twenty years ago, and has been maintained as a mission ever since that time, . . The building cost $4.600, which was contrib- uted by the benevolent people of this city. A reli-gious service is held there on every Sabbath evening, a Sabbath school on Sabbath afternoon, and a regular Friday evening meeting. . . . Many of those who attend there are people who would not go to a service anywhere else. It is an entirely benevolent and non-sectarian work. . . . My genial colleague from the Sixth district [Mr. Cogswell] objected the other day to a permission which the Committee on Printing had given me to print a 'picture of this mission house in the Record. . . I believe that my colleague objected on constitutional grounds, on the ground that this was recognizing some particular sect, Now, I-  find on page 36 of this bill that it appropri-ates $45,700 for purely sectarian institutions, and yet, after recommending such an appropriation as that, it is proposed to wipe out this little poor lone missionary chapel! I really hope that the committee will consent to my amendment. . . . MR. COGSWELL. Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes me as displaying an equal mixture of audacity and unconstitutionality. [Laughter.] In the first place, the reservation to which it relates is a small one, the property of the United States, which this Bethel has occupied for twenty years free from rent, and never should have occupied at all; `and now, when the Government needs the reservation as a site for a public building, the people who are interested in this Bethel, represented on this floor by my friend and colleague, Mr. Morse, come in and do what they can to deprive the Government of the possession and use of its own property, which their Bethel has had for twenty years for nothing; although, as I believe, the Government had not then, and has not to-day, the right to appropriate, or loan, or give, the use of any Government reservation or property for the benefit of any religious sect. I do not believe that constitutionally these people  could hold the position they now occupy for a ma' merit, and I am surprised that objection has never been raised before to their occupation of that prop--erty. So much as to the unconstitutionality of the' amendment. The audacity of it is that these people, who have used this property of the United States in violation of the Constitution for twenty years, should now come in here and try to keep the GovernmentŁ from utilizing its own property for a site for an enginh house, which is very much needed. I hope the amend-ment will be voted down. MR. Rumex. Is it proposed that the Government shall take this chapel building and destroy it without making any compensation ? MR. COGSWELL. Oh, no, It is a little wooden chapel placed on posts, which the Government does not propose to touch, but simply to ask these people to move off the ground. MR. MORSE. They have no place to move it to. A MEMBER. Let them buy a lot, then. HumcE. I understand the gentleman from Massachusetts to say that it cost $4, 600, MR. MORSE. It did; and they have no other place to put it. Mn. BOWERS of California. Let them buy a lot, as the colored people do. MR. HULICK. I suppose very few members of this body know anything about that chapel, but they ought to go to church there some Sunday and find out. [Laughter.] MR. LIVINGSTON. I want to ask the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Cogswell] whether we are not making in this bill very large appropriations for other denominational institutions ? MR. COGSWELL. In regard to that suggestion, which was made also by my colleague, I supposed that there was a difference between charity, which all religious sects cover with the mantle of their professions, and the recognition of a religious sect as such. My point is against recognizing any religious sect, which the Constitution expressly forbids. MR. LIVINGSTON. And my point is that some of these institutions for which we appropriate are purely denominational institutionsŠnothing but that. A MEmsER. What denomination is this Bethel ? MR. COGSWELL. Presbyterian. MR. MORSE. It is nondenominational. A MEMBER. I understood the gentleman himself to say that it belonged to the Presbyterian Church. MR. COGSWELL. Now, Mr. Chairman, that Bethel ought not to stand there a minute longer. We have no right to let it be there, and never had. MR. COMPTON. Mr. Chairman, I only want to re-mark, in addition to what the gentleman from Massa-chusetts [Mr. Cogswell] has said, that if this amend merit prevails it will entail an additional expense on the Government of perhaps $20,000. While the exist-ing engine house in that district is absolutely out of condition for further use as an engine house, it can be given to this congregation and they can use it, at a comparatively small cost for repairs, as a meeting house, and I understand that the Commissioners are ready and willing to give them the use of the engine house for that purpose. The question being taken on the amendment of Mr. Morse, the Chairman declared that the noes seemed to have it. MR. MORSE. I ask for a division. The committee divided; and there wereŠayes 8, noes 60. MR. MORSE. No quorum, Mr. Chairman. THE CHAIRMAN. The point of no quorum being made, the Chair will appoint to act as tellers the gen-tleman from Maryland [Mr. Compton] and the gentle-man from Massachusetts [Mr. Morse]. The committee divided, and the tellers reportedŠayes 1Š MR. ItORSE (pending the completion of the count by tellers). Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the point of no quorum. I move to strike out the last word of the paragraph, however, in order to say a word in regard to an understanding that I have with the gentleman in charge of this bill. I tried as hard as I could to hear what the gentleman from Maryland was saying awhile ago, but I was unable to do so. He now tells me that he stated that the Commissioners of the Dis-trict of Columbia, since this matter has been agitated, have said that they would give this mission the use of the old engine house to repair and fix up for the pur-poses of their mission. With that understanding, and only about fifty gentlemen have voted, and there is undoubtedly no quorum in the city this afternoon, so that it would delay the public business to insist upon the point, I have withdrawn the point of no quorum; but I desire these remarks to go into the Record, and I will call the attention of the Commissioners of the District to this understanding, namely, that the Beth-any Mission, conducted by the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, is to have the old engine house to fix up to use for the purposes of their mission, such as they have conducted for the last twenty years. In the Record of March 13, the subject is again continued:Š MR. MORSE. Mr. Speaker, I desire to correct the Record. On Saturday we passed the district appro-
