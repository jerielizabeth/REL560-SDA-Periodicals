Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay fork. (Entered at the New York Postoffice.) "THE revealed will of God" is a phrase often used to conceal the will of a bigot. ot THE true religion wants nothing which it is in the power of the civil authority to give. STEEL and lead are not good conductors for an outflowing current of Christian benevolence. .4 .4 SOCIETY cannot elevate or reform itself any more than a machine can create power to run itself. .4 .4 THE truly "Christian conscience" seeks not to have men punished for their sins, but saved from them. .4 .4 THE saloon may be induced to keep Sunday, but this will be very doubtful honor for the "Sabbath." ot THE doctrine of imperialism assumes the people of foreign lands to be guilty until they are proved innocent, incapable until they are proved capable. oe THE Christian Church wants no help from the State any more than a steamship wants help from the ocean.

MOODY does not agree with the clergymen who are preaching reform by "Christian citi-zenship" and similar theories. We hear it said every-where now that the great need of the church is to secure the alliance of the State. In Pittsburg, for example, a federation of the churches has secured an alliance with a great labor organization, by which achievement it is thought an important step has been taken toward the overthrow of the kingdom of evil and the setting up of righteousness in the earth, or at least in that portion of it. The system only needs to be extended to produce general righteousness in society and government, and it is proposed to extend it; for as one speaker said, "We are going to have one vast confederacy and federation;" and then "Woe to him who stands up against it." But Evangelist Moody takes no stock in anything of
