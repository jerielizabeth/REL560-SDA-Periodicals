376 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY respondent of the Catholic Standard and Times: The only governments of civilized countries which have had no share in these literally uni-versal demonstrations have been Italy and the United States; that of the first named country for obvious reasons; the second for no reasons which are known. Not for want of precedent, since in the jubilee of 1888 the Archbishop of Philadelphia was the medium of presenting to the Pope a copy of the American Constitution, sent as a gift to the Pope by President Cleve-land. Nor for want of later precedent, as the share of His Holiness first in the sympathy and then in the mourning for President Mc-Kinley, which was reported on official author-ity in these columns, attests in the fullest man-ner. The omission is, indeed, unless it is to be repaired, inexplicable. Even the King of Roumania, who did not send an embassy, com-missioned the Archbishop of Bucharest to pre-sent an autograph letter of congratulation, and as the staff at the San Silvestro telegraph office has been increased for the occasion, a message sent by cable would have reached ,the Vatican with the thousands of similar ones and pre-vented the appearance of a regrettable omis-sion. So the papal spokesmen would culti-vate the impression and have it prevail throughout the earth that it is an inex-cusable thing, a gross discourtesy to the Pope and the Papacy, for the American Government to go ahead and attend strictly to its business instead of getting in line with the other powers that were tumbling over themselves in their eager-ness to pay their respects to and lay their gifts before the head of the Roman Cath-olic Church ! It would have been a happy circum-stance if the Vatican and its spokesmen had been left in this same state of mind permanently, but now they are rejoicing that the "inexplicable," the "regrettable omission" is to be more than repaired by the coming to the Vatican of a govern-mental commission, which, "it is author-itatively stated in Rome," "will offer to His Holiness the congratulations and best wishes of the American administra- tion." And thus by "the rational recog-nition of his position and aims by the American Government, marking as it does the first relations of the kind be-tween Rome and Washington," the "shortcoming which was so glaring at the 3rd of March" will be abundantly remedied. And thus will come to pass "one of, the greatest successes of the reign of Leo XIII." The Southern New England Method-ist Conference, in session at Rockville, Conn., on April 7, took cognizance of two things in which church-and-state union is still perpetuated in this coun-try≈†legal regulation of "Sabbath" ob-servance and governmental chaplaincies. But, in harmony with the present tend-ency in the great denominations, this cognizance was taken not for the pur-pose of presenting the true principle and asking that it be adhered to, but for the purpose of securing more con-cessions and a greater violation of the principle, as is shown by these resolu-tions adopted by the conference: Whereas, The practise in the United States navy of having inspection on Sunday morn-ing, it is believed, operates greatly against the interest of the religious service held afterward by the chaplain, and Whereas, The chaplains are placed at much disadvantage and are brought into disrespect by the character of the uniforms they are re-quired to wear and by the lower remuneration which they receive as compared with that of other officers of the same grade. Therefore, be it resolved: First, that we re-spectfully memorialize Congress to enact at this session such legislation as will require a better observance of the Sabbath on the ves-sels of the navy ; and second, that such legis-lation be enacted as will require that chaplains of that branch of the service shall be so uni-formed and otherwise provided for that they may better command the respect of those under their oversight and spiritual care. It is in the nature of things that men who dispense religion by governmental
