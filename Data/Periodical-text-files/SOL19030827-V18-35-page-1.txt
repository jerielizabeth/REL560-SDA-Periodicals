Ł bk The "On=to=Ottawa" Campaign Under Way PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, AUGUST 27, 1903 NO. 35 11, Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion, we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in anywise fa'bored,  none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observance, but that they shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain of our highest displeasure. ŠFrom proclamation issued by Queen Victoria and approved by the Parlia-ment of Great Britain in x858. Sunday succeeded to the Sabbath not by divine law, but by political and ecclesiastical ordinance. Uniformity, good as it is, must come through liberty, if it comes at all. It will never come through coercion. One would have thought that the absolute futility of endeavoring to force people to keep a day as a holy dayŠthat is, of imposing a frame of mind or a set of emotions upon people by statuteŠwould have been apparent even in the days of Cromwell. It certainly should be to-day. ŠHon. John S. Ewart, K. C., in lecture on "The Sunday Question" at St. George's Church, Winnipeg, Manitoba November 9, 1902.
