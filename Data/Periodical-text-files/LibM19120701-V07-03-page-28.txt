NEAR VIEW OF COLUMBUS MONUMENT BEFORE UNVEILING 122 LIBERTY court of the State of New York, deliv-ered the address, which an editorial in the Catholic journal America declares " was pregnant with Catholic thought:" and the Knights of Columbus, to the number of many thousands, with weap- that day and the event which they set off are to be used as a lever for accomplish-ing another purpose, and the objective of that purpose is also the glorification of the Catholic Church. The erection of the Columbus monument and its unveil-  ing ceremonies are to be used to influence the national government to make Columbus d a y a national holiday. When that has been ac-complished, the wheels of the government and the wheels of the nation's industry will cease to revolve on each October 12 (even as they cease to revolve now in thirty of the States), while the people have impressed upon their minds the might and the glory of the Roman Church and its influence with the government. That these Columbus celebrations are church affairs, the officials of that church admit. The Boston Pilot, offi-cial organ of Cardinal O'Connell (as quoted in the Independent of Oct. 12, 191 1), speak-ing of Columbus day ons of war in their hands, marched at the head of the great procession through the streets of Washington, passing in re-view before the President and the Sec-retary of State. This was considered by Catholics everywhere a great day for the " mother church." But the result of it is not to end with the performances of that day. The spectacular ceremonies of  Catholic duty, says: Å  Every Catholic man who is in a po-sition to do so, should take part in the great parade of Columbus day. It should be a source of pride thus to make public profession of the faith that is in him. He should not be deterred by false human respect. In honoring the great discoverer, he is paying tribute to the faith that prompted and still prompts greatness of character, high ideals, and noble achievements.
