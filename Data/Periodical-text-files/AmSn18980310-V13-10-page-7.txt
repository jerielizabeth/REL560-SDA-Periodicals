AMERICAN SENTINEL. 151 true to Him to whom they had been married, He would in due time bring them back from that northern country of captivity to the land which had been given to their fathers for an inheritance. Jer. 3:14-18. To Abraham God had said that his seed should return to the land of promise after four hundred years. Gen. 15:13-16. To Judah, however, the promise was that they should return from their captivity at the end of seventy years. Jer. 25:9-11. God assured them, through the prophet, that he would not forsake them, because of his "everlasting" love for them, and so would positively bring them back again from the north country to which they would be carried by the oppressor. Jer. 31:3-9. As was predicted, in due time the king of Babylon came at the head of an army to Jerusalem, took away its treasures, and led captive the inhabitants of Judah, and that land lay desolate for seventy years, while its people languished in Babylonian captiv-ty. Dan. 1 :1,2. To all human appearance, the purpose of God was then thwarted. But the promise to Abraham had been backed by the oath of God (Heb. 6:13-18), and could not thus be made void by Satan, even though the powers of earth were at hand to do his bidding. At the end of the predicted seventy years, Babylon was conquered by the Medo-Persian army. The Jews were then, by decree of Cyrus (Ezra 1:1-3), permitted to return to Palestine, but that territory was held under the rule of Persia. The territory was not restored to the seed of Abraham; they were simply permitted to dwell there as strangers, like their great ancestor, upon whom the promise of possessing the land was first bestowei. The fifth power through whom Satan attempted to deprive the seed of Abraham of their inherited rights, soon came upon the scene to act the part assigned to it by the One whose usurped territory it was permitted to occupy. Grecia gained the ascendancy in the third cen-tury before Christ, and thus the Jewish nation came under the authority of another heathen power, which continued to deprive them of the control of the territory to which they were heirs, as the seed of Abraham. Under the sixth powerŠpagan RomeŠthe one true Seed, who was to be head and front of all the believing children of Abraham, came upon the stage, as the right-ful heir of God's promise to the father of the faithful. Gal. 3:16. He was born in JudahŠthe proper placeŠand was of the seed of David, who was of the lineage of Abra-ham. Matt. 1:1. Through all this line of family connec-tions, the record of pedigree had been carefully preserved so that it was fully known by Satan, as well as by the faithful in the house of Israel, that the "babe of Bethle-hem" was the long-promised seed. Luke 2:25-34. Herod -the Roman governor of Judea, immediately gave orders to kill all children in the region about Bethlehem, who were under two years of age, in order to destroy this royal seed of Abraham. Matt. 2:12-16. By a warning from God, the Child escaped this on-slaught of government decree, but was afterward given a mock trial before Pilate, and condemned to be cruci- fied. This, however, was a failure; for on the third day after, the crucified One burst the tomb, and came forth to life, to ascend to his Father, from whence he had come. This was a great triumph for the seed of Abraham. The natural seed of the patriarch had lost at every con-test with Satan. But now their great representative had shown himself superior to every attack of the arch enemy. In the widerness of temptation, he had refused to ac-knowledge the authority of the usurper, even though the promise of yielding up the disputed territory was freely made to Him. Luke 4:5, 6. Although He was born a King (John 18:37), yet when the people attempted to make Him king over Satan's subjects, He sturdily refused, and fled away. John 6:15. At last, when every effort had been exhausted, yet without avail, to make Christ yield to Satan's authority, the power of the government was invoked to put him out of the way, and so to rid the world of one who was likely to inherit the promise made to the seed of Abraham But when Christ arose from the dead and ascended on high, Satan vented his spleen against the country and the people of the Jews. The Roman army was induced to destroy the temple and the city of J erusalem, and scatter the Jewish nation to all parts of the earth. But that did not matter then. The people of Judah, though extreme-ly wicked, had only been held together until the pedigree of Christ had been established as the seed of Abraham, when their union as a nation was no longer necessary. They had themselves rejected the One to which all their prophecies pointed as the Messiah,Šthe anointed One,Šwho was to be the salvation of their title to the inheri-tance. From the time of their rejection of him, the king-dom was to belong to another people who would bring forth the fruits of the kingdon of God. Matt. 21:43. The literal seed of Abraham was then no longer in evidence. They had been held together as the connecting link between Abraham and the One to whom the promise was made, after which all who are the children of the promise must become such "by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:19,25. So then, all who now become Christ's are, through this relationship, Abraham's seed, and heirs ac-cording to the promise. Verse 29. This being so, the persecution of Satan was extended from the literal seed to the spiritual. Since the appear ance of Christ as the Head of Abraham's seed, his fol-lowers are also made to suffer through national power. Under pagan Rome, the sixth persecuting power, even the Jews, the literal seed of Abraham, united with the government to persecute Christians. When the system of government changed from Imperial to priestly, from  pagan to papal,Šthe persecution became more deep -sea ted and wide-spread than ever, because the seed of Abraham became more widely extended, reaching from the seed-sowing at Jerusalem to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Luke 24:47. Of this we will speak at another time. J. 0. C. "IN time of peace prepare for war."
