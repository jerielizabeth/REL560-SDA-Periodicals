364 THE ŁAMERICA.N SENTINEL. ical denominations, but who are so utterly desti-tute of the Spirit of Christ, and so entirely con-trolled by lust for civil power to persecute those who differ from them, that they openly court al-liance with Rome and brazenly avow their trea-sonable and wicked intentions. It is time that every conscientious person should study carefully the relations of civil government and religion, and be prepared to defend these inseparable gems of gospel truthŠhuman equality in civil matters and individual accountability to God alone, morally.ŠIra D. Blanchard, in Western American, Chicago. Public Schools and Church Property. ONE of the most prominent of the demands now being made is that the nation shall insert the name of God, if not a formal recognition of Chris-tianity, into our national Constitution. But surely this would not make the nation any more Christian if public and private sentiment be not in accordance with it. The Southern Confeder-acy placed such a clause into their articles of federation; but, while their republic was based on human slavery, what was it but a solemn mockery? I take it, the true way for this people to show its Christianity is not to write its dogmas in their Constitution, but to exhibit its virtues in their public and private lives. Remember, too, that such an acknowledgment of God or Christ or Bible would amount to nothing in itself, would be a mere dead letter, unless made vital by a definition of it. That would be the next and neces-sary step. There is not a word, a sentence, a doc-trine in our National Constitution that is not sub-ject to some interpretation, and made an authority in our civil and political life. But the moment you thus define the new amendment you recog-nize some explicit form of religion in the land, and commit a flagrant injustice upon your fellow-citizens who do not share that form of belief. For who is to decide upon that interpretation ?ŠThe majority, of course. Now, this majority to-day is an orthodox Protestant one, and will be for along time to come. But to give such a definition of the amendment would be to violate the consciences of the Catholic, the Jew, the Unitarian, and a vast number of religious Liberals" and Freethink-ers. They would not be slow to resist such an in-vasion of their personal rights; and thus this seemingly harmless Christian amendment in real-ity has in it the seeds of social strife, religious war, and a possible disruption of the republic. What blindness, what madness, then, possessed the Protestant advocates of such an amendment ? Honest they no doubt are, but grievously un-wise. If the proposed amendment should pass Congress by the requisite two-thirds majority, and receive a three-fourths vote in three-fourths of all the States, as is required,Ša contingency most unlikely to occur in the present temper of the American people,Šit would prove the most dan-gerous weapon against the Protestant religion that could be put into the hands of its opponents. The only really practical benefits would accrue to the Roman Catholic, as the -strongest ecclesiasti-cal body. That church would soon make an ap-plication of it that would make the overzealous Protestant look with affright at the consequences of their folly. Another demand put forth by the Protestant opponents of the American doctrine of Church and State is for the retention of the Bible in the public schools. A sufficient reason for its exclu- sion is to be found in the fact that the public reading of the Bible is a liturgical act, as much so in the public schools as in the public service of religion. Now, we have no right to introduce -liturgical acts into a professedly secular institution, espe-cially one supported by a tax levied indiscrimi-nately on all. To read the Bible in the public schools is to inculcate religion there, and a par-ticular form of religion as well. . . . You may do this if you have the power, but you cannot do it justly. You may vote down the Catholic, the Jew, the Rationalist, but you can-not reason them down. In retaining the Bible, you are only encouraging the Roman Catholic de-mand for a division 4)f the public school funds, and justifying parochial and private schools for the education of Catholic youth. Both policy and justice, then, should lead to the prompt and total withdrawal of the Bible from all public schools of America. If Protestant interests suffer thereby, so much the more shame to the Protestant Church. But let us not do evil that good may come. The only public-school system possible or just in a community like ours, in which there is so much diversity of religious opinion, and in which all are taxed indiscriminately for its sup-port, is one based on secular education, and from which all religious features are excluded. The only school in Oakland where this secularization is not carried out is the Oakland High School, and this matter ought to be remedied there also. Another notable demand by the upholders of the divine right of the church is for a continued exemption of all church property from taxation. This is not only wrong to the other interests of the community, which have to make up the defi-ciency, but also directly encourages both the sec-tarian rivalry and the luxury and ostentation of the churches, which are such serious obstacles to the progress of a true Christianity. In Chi-cago I visited recently a splendid and luxurious temple, the property of a few rich men, which they use but a few hours each week. The rest of the time it is given over to silence and emptiness Šhandsome to look at, but otherwise as useless a piece of property as you will find in the whole city. Its cost was;  perhaps, a quarter of a mill-ion of dollars ; and if justly taxed, as it ought to be, it would place in the city treasury some five or six thousand dollars, or enough to furnish the suffering poor with fuel during the hard winter. Now ,why should these excellent gentlemen be exempted from paying for their private luxury in worshiping God, when the poor mechanic or la-borer who happens to own the roof over his head, however humble it may be, must come forward promptly and pay Łhis tax upon itŠa tax larger because of this very exemption of church prop-erty? In that very city I knew a Roman Catholic priest who purchased quite a tract of land, built a small chapel, and for eight years had the whole tract exempted from taxation. At the end of this time he sold the land at a large increase and built a costly church nearly a mile farther south. Is the State to be a partner in such ecclesiastical real-estate speculations ? Consider, too, how rapidly the church property is increasing in this country. In San Francisco it amounts to something like $6,000,000, and is taxed for only $1,769,915. If justly taxed it would maintain all the city charities, and half pay for the public schools besides. In New York City the single corporation of Trinity Church owns property valued at $25,000,000. Accord-ing to the census of 1850, the amount of property held by the different religious denominations in the United States was $87,000,000. In 1860, only ten years after, it had doubled, and was re-turned at $171,000,000. In 1870 it' had again doubled, amounting to $354,000,000. If this rate of increase be kept up till the end of the present century only, it would reach the enor-mous sum of $2,835,000,000. Will not our gov-ernment soon have to take steps to restrict and regulate this dangerous monopolyŠa monopoly more threatening to our future peace as a nation than any other which afflicts us? Now the best restriction upon it is to equitably tax all church property ; and, in view of its enormous wealth, the deinand-  of the-  church for a continued ex-emption seems' singulary immodest and unfair. In the Catholic parish church at Monterey I read a complaint affixed to its walls that Califor-nia is the only State in the Union which taxes its churches. All honor to our State for that. It only.points the way which all our States will, sooner or later, be compelled to follow. I am proud of the action of our Unitarian Society in Tacoma, which sent up last month to the Consti-tutional Convention of the new State of Wash-ington a petition that all church property be equally and equitably taxed. Let me ask once more, "Has civil society a right to give the public money outright to a religious or ecclesiastical body, to a missionary or tract society, or to a church?" According to our American doctrine of'Church and State, it has not. "But is there any difference between releasing one from a debt of $10, which he is bound to pay, and giving him $10 ? Is there any difference whatever between paying out money from the public treasury and remitting taxes that are coin-ing into the public treasury?" It is often said, in reply to this, that churches ought not to be taxed because they yield no in-come. But the question of income does not enter into the reasons of taxation at all. A great many .things yield no income, and yet are taxedŠwild lands, for instance, and other unproductive real property. A great many of our merchants to-day would like to be exempt from taxation on their unsold or depreciated stocks, from which they receive no returns. But most commonly it is argued in behalf of the churches that there are many substantial bene-fits arising to the State from their existence, and this ought to be considered a fair exchange for their unpaid taxes. But the argument proves too much. Nearly all kinds of private property render important public service to the State. All private schools, for example; all art galleries, opera houses, and 'music halls; all life insurance companies, railways, and banksŠmight claim a similar exemption on the ground of public serv-ices rendered the State. The only honest and sensible way is for churches to bear their fair share of public taxation, as well as other corpora-tions. In the Old World the property exempt from taxes often amounted to one-third or even one-half of the entire amount returned. At last the evil became so unbearable that the governments took the matter in hand and remedied it. Shall we maintain in free America a system. which the monarchies of Europe have found impracticable and dangerous to the State ? To the other demands made by an unwise Protestantism, I can only refer by name. Such
