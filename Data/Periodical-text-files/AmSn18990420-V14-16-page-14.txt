DO YOU KNOW that Miles' Pocket Dictionary is based upon the great " Webster's International Dictionary" ? That it has a double index by which any desired word is found in a moment of time? That it is the only abridged dictionary that gives the full pronuncia-tion of words? That it has a device, called the "Columbian Word-Builder," that dou-bles the capacity of the book, making it contain more words than any other dic-tionary short of an unabridged? That it has 45,800 WORDS ? This book, of vest-pocket size, is not only the handiest and the most complete, but it actually embodies five other books, all of which are characterized by the same elements of com-pleteness; viz.: a Pronouncing and Sta-tistical Gazetteer of the World; a Rapid Calculator and Compend-ium of Business Forms; a Parlia-mentary Manual, based on Roberts' and Cushing's; and a Letter Writer and Lit-erary Guide. It is a complete library of five pocket reference books bound in one volume and weighs only two ounces.
