         -VOL. 9, Xo. 20.            body sees now the very things that are set forth in this scripture. Then every per-son has before his eyes, and held irresisti-bly upon his attention, the positive proofs that we are in the last days. The Scriptures having spoken of the rich and of the poor; of the hoarding of wealth and the keeping back of the wages; of the fear of the rich and the cries of the labor-ersŠhaving spoken of these two classes, it now speaks of a third, or rather, to a third, thus, " Be patient, therefore, brethren." These are the Lord's people who are now spoken to, for he said, "Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother." Matt. 12: 50. So in the times described in the previous verses, in the last days, the Lord gives a word of counsel to his own people, and he gives this counsel because of the times that are here described; so he says, " Be patient, therefore, breth-ren." And what further ?Š" Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord." Then the great meaning, above all other meanings, which all these things bear to the people of the world to-day is, that the Lord is coming. These are signs, evi-dences, clear and plain, of the coming of the Lord, that are being held before the eyes and upon the attention of all the people, so that it is impossible that they should not see them. Whether the people will believe that these are signs of his coming, or not, is for the people them-selves to decide. The Lord has fixed upon these things in his Word, and says that that is what they are. And those who would be the brethren and the people of the Lord, must see in all these things that meaning which the Lord says is there; namely, that the Lord is coming. The scripture continues : " Behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and the latter rain." As certainly as the sowing of the seed by the farmer means a certain result, and the farmer certainly expects that re-sult, so certainly these things which are described in this chapter, and which all the people now see, mean a certain result, and mean that the people seeing these things can as certainly expect that result as the farmer may expect the result from his sowing. Then, just as the farmer, when he has planted his grain, waiteth patiently for the harvest, so the Lord would have his people wait patiently for that harvest, which is to be the end of this sowing, and "the harvest is the end of the world." Matt. 13: 39. Consequently the scripture continues to counsel of God, "Be ye also patient; stab-lish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be con-demned : behold, the Judge standeth before the door." Then the coming of the Lord is so near, and the Judge, standing before the door, is so nearly ready to open that door and call all men to account, that it is too late to indulge grievances, complaints, and grudges against others. Of course, there is never time for any such thing as that, but now, of all times that there have ever been in the world, there is the least time for such things and the greatest risk in indulging them. " The coming of the Lord draweth nigh," "the Judge stand-eth before the door," and as " every one of us" is to "give account of himself to God," and as that account is about to be called for, the thing to do is for every one to have his account so squared up each day and each hour, that if the Judge should open the door and call for the ac-count, it can be rendered with joy and not with grief. it, and eternal life depends on standing in this judgment. Can we hope to stand if we knowingly change this law, and live according to our change in preference to God's plain requirement ? In proportion as one values eternal life, he will jealously cling to the letter of this law. If men make 'laws which require him to depart from the explicit command of God, he is called upon to choose between obeying God or men. To obey men under such circumstances is to do it at the peril of eternal life. By clinging to the letter of God's law the individual does not en-danger the interests of the State; on the contrary, his course is for the good of the State. It is possible for the Si ate to make such laws as would lead to its own ruin, and it is the duty of every true friendl of the State to oppose such laws. If he does so by refusing to obey in order to keep God's commandments, and suffers punish-ment in consequence, he becomes a martyr to protect the true interests of the State. All laws enacted by the State infringing one's right to keep God's law according to his word are against the interests of the State and should be opposed by every true citizen for two reasons. First, be-cause he cannot endanger his eternal interests by not exercising his right to keep God's commandments; and second, because he desires the good and the pres- ervation of the State. H. P. HOLSER. Basle, Switzerland.      The State and the Ten Command-. ments. THE Lord made the earth, and as Crea-tor he is Proprietor. He has not given any man or nation a monopoly of the world, but has created all men free and equal, and holds all responsible for doing his will. Those that do his will are given eternal life, while those that do not, per-ish. God's will is expressed in the ten commandments, hence it is every man's right to keep these commandments. If a community of men associated to-gether in a State forbids its citizens to keep these commandments, or makes laws which render it impossible to keep them without loss in fines or imprisonment, it then becomes a question with the individ-ual of obeying God or man. Under such circumstances, the man that is true in obedience to God is compelled by the State to stand in society as a transgressor, and is punished as such. By making laws that produce such conditions, the State exceeds its province in that it takes from man a right that God has bestowed upon all alike. According to the Scriptures, the prov-ince of the State is to punish evil doers, and not those that do well. Rom. 13 :1-3. By keeping God's commandments one is doing well, not evil, and should have praise of the State instead of punishment. In making laws that hinder its citizens from keeping the commandments, the State sets itself up in direct opposition to God. It forbids and punishes as evil what God pronounces good and the duty of all men. This is precisely what is brought about by Sunday laws. Such laws make it im-possible to keep the ten commandments without suffering under the pious-gloved hand of the State as an evil-doer, for God's law requires men to keep the seventh day (Saturday) and work the other six days. Men may say that Sunday-keeping is meant to fulfill this Sabbath law; but it does not. God's law plainly says the seventh day, and what right have we to make such wholesale changes in the divine law ? To assume the right to change the law is to claim to be above the law giver. The papacy claims the right to change God's law; and for this reason the Bible represents the papacy as exalting itself above God. 2 Thess. 2:1-4. Any power, civil or ecclesiastical, that takes the same course is guilty of the same sin; and God solemnly warns men against do-ing it. In civil courts the judge holds to the letter of the law; he will not allow one word to be changed, and is careful to get at the true meaning of every word. If man is thus particular with his own law, should he be less so with God's ? Or, if while he is so exact with his own law, he allows, and even advises, wholesale changes in God's law without God's sanc-tion, does he not show much more regard for his own law than God's ? And if Christians consent to such a course, are they not equally guilty ? God's law is binding on all men, whether they ac-knowledge it or not; all will be judged by The Mark of the Beast.  THE Bible says that " the secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever." Deut. 29: 29. The last book in the Bible is called a Revelation, something revealed, hence it is intended to be studied and understood by the people of this world and their chil-dren. And a blessing is pronounced upon all who study it. "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein; for the time is at hand." Chap. 1: verse 3. In the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, two great powers are brought to view, which, as the agents of Satan, are to com-plete the drama of this world in its rebel-lion against God. These two powers are represented by two distinct symbols in the form of beasts. They are to exist at the same time, although the career of the second power is to be short as compared with that of the first. The second beast is to perform miracles in the sight of the first beast (verse 14), which it could not do unless it existed at the same time. It is to form a partnership with the first beast for the purpose of enforcing the worship of that beast. Both are persecut-ing powers. The characteristics of the first beast, together with the fact that he received his power and authority from the dragon (verses 1, 2), show that this power is a persecutor by nature; hence it is no sur-prise that it should "make war with the saints." But that the second power should persecute is a matter of greatest astonish-ment. For the symbol represents it as having the appearance of a lamb, and it is contrary to the nature of a lamb to per-secute. Who could make one believe that a lamb would do him harm ? Yet the Scriptures say that this power, so lamb-like in appearance, will speak as a dragon.
