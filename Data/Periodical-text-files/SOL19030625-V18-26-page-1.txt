PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, JUNE 25, 1903 NO. 26 The rule of those who claim to be His followers is not necessarily the rule of Christ. The "Christianizing" of a government means the legal-izing of intolerance and persecution. "When man undertakes to become God's avenger he becomes a demon." When he assumes God's authority he becomes a persecuting tyrant. "No legislature should attempt to make laws against everything that is morally bad, or for everything that is morally good. Law is not religion or morality." The spirit of righteousness is the only effective cure for the spirit of lawlessness, and the spirit of righteousness cannot be put into people by "the enforcement of law." The follolPers of Christ who imagine that they are au-thorized to establish His authority over and to rule the na-tions for Him, babe" anything but a clear understanding of His will in the matter. The answer to the Sunday question which the Chris-tian citizen should give is clear. He has no right to put the religious restriction of his conscience on another. Let us catch the spirit of Jesus Christ, . . . and while we take care to live honestly by our own faith in God and duty, grant to each man the right to live by his faith and his conception of duty.ŠFrom sermon by Rev.
