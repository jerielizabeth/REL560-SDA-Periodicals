This work treats o the Elements of Chronol-ogy, the different systems, and the various eras, and gives, the chronology of the principal events recorded in Sacred History from the Creation till the death of St. John. It also contains a vindica-tiOn 'of the numbers of the Hebrew Scriptives. As an aid to investigation it is invaluable. The book has been thoroughly revised, and an entire chapter added, on the PEOPLING OF THE EARTH. This chapter is an exposition of the tenth chap-ter of Genesis, and gives an outline of the beginning of History and THE ORIGIN OF NATIONS. New and valuable notes have been added to the 'original text of the book, making it the most val-uable work on the subject of sacred chronology extant. No student of history can well do without it. It contains a vast amount of infor-mation in small space, and so far from being dry is is as interesting as a story, which it really is. 300 pages, cloth binding, with side stamp, $ I .00.

History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he.who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The " Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the church, and The Incautious Lowering of the Standard of Pure Christianity, Developed the PAPACY, which was simply a new phase of paganism. It shows that by the time of. Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book. Fine English cloth, substantially bound, contains about 400 pages, and will be sent post-paid at the nominal price of $1.00. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 43 BOND STREET, NEW YORK.
