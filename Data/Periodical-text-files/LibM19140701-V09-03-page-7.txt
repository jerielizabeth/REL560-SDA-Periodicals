LIBERTY "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Lev. 25: 10. Vol.. IX THIRD QUARTER, 1914 Religious Proclamations by the Nation's Executive A Hitherto Unpublished Essay by James Madison, Fourth President of the United States RELIGIOUS proclamations by the exec-utive recommending thanksgivings and fasts, are shoots from the same root with the legislative acts reviewed. Although recommendations only, they imply a religious agency, making no part of the trust delegated to political rulers. The objections to them are : Å  I. That governments ought not to in-terpose in relation to those subject to their authority, but in cases where they can do it with effect. An advisory gov-ernment is a contradiction in terms. 2.

But reason and the prin-ciples of the Christian religion require that if all the individuals composing a nation were of the same precise creed and wished to unite in a universal act of religion at the same time, the union ought to be effected through the inter-vention of their religious, not of their political representatives. In a nation composed of various sects, some alien-ated widely from others, and where no agreement could take place through the former, the interposition of the latter is doubly wrong. 4. The tendency of the practice is to narrow the recommendation to the stand-ard of the predominant sect. The first proclamation of General Washington, dated Jan.
