PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 5, 1903 NO. 6 The experience of history shows that free gobernment, once established, can be preserved only by the individual stand-ing upon his rights, or more pointedly speaking, keeping government . . . at arm's-length. This is a thing . . . entirely consistent with the highest loyalty to gobernment. . . . A small encroachment of arbitrary power by government leads quite inevitably, if suffered without opposition, to greater and greater ones, and to a growing multitude of them, . . . ending in the tem-porary or permnnent destruction of free government. Cicero said of Julius Caesar that as he looked at him adjusting his hair so nicely and scratching his head with one finger, it never occurred to him that such a man could conceive so vast and fatal a design as the destruction of the Roman commonwealth. And so it is with the first invasions and encroachments upon the rights and liberties of the citizen. They appear at first, if noticed at all, as commonplace and harmless as the very ordinary-looking man Caesar scratch-ing his head appeared to Cicero; and yet they are germs pregnant with the destruction of free goverment. MR. JUSTICE WILLIAM J. GAYNOR, of the Supreme Court of New York, in the North American Review for January.
