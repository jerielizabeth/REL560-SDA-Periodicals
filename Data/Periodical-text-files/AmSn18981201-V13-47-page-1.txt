This will be a "temporary loan" for such a time as may be necessary before the church in Cuba shall be able to support herself,Šso say the Catholic pre-lates which the Government has consulted in the matter. It is a support which may be kept up indefinitely, without any compensation in return, besides being in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of free government. What do the American people think, and what will they do, about it? See articles on next page. SIN never suffers much from the rebukes of sinners.
