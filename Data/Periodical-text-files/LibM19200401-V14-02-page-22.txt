C., Mrs. Della Post, a Seventh-day Ad-ventist who conscientiously keeps the sev-enth day of the week for the Sabbath, was ar-raigned on an indictment for breaking the Sun-day law. The specific charge was hauling wood on Sunday. The evidence showed that Mrs. Post was returning a one-horse wagon that she had borrowed. She had thrown a few armfuls of wood into the wagon to give to the one from whom she borrowed it. A deputy sheriff, who was anxious to arrest a Seventh-day Adventist, was lying in wait. When she drove by on Sun-day, he arrested her for breaking the Sunday law, and compelled her to hitch her mule and go with him a long distance over the mountain to a justice of the peace, where he preferred charges against her, and then let her return home by herself in the night over a dangerous and lonely mountain way. The evidence discovered that she was the breadwinner for an aged husband and a family of children, and that malice and bad feeling had prompted the prosecution. After the case was given to the jury, the first ballot resulted in nine for acquittal and three for conviction. In a few minutes the three joined the majority, and the accused was set free and sent back to her home and friends. It is rumored that the deputy sheriff who arrested her has left that part of the country. There is general neighborhood sympathy for Mrs. Post, many believing that she was the victim of persecution. They do not see the justice and equality in the enforcement of a statute that will allow the Sunday law to be openly violated by the people generally, while those who keep the seventh day for the Sabbath are required to obey strictly the letter of the Sunday law. They hold that either the law is class legislation, or the enforcement of the law is partial, arbitrary, and unfair. Good Case on an Appeal We congratulate Mrs. Post on her just deliv-erance, and the jury and court on their right-eous judgment. The case, however, was a good one for the supreme court, and for that reason we would have been glad for the opportunity of presenting the principles of religious liberty from our viewpoint to that learned and honor-able tribunal. The following are some of the legal propositions that the case involved: That driving a wagon on Sunday through the State of North Carolina by one who is not a 52  citizen of the said State, on a continuous, inter-state journey, traveling through the said State, from one State to another, is not in the nature of a nuisance, and is not a crime per se, either at common law or under the statute claimed to have been violated by the defendant, and is therefore not an indictable offense. That the traveling of one who is the citizen of another State through the State of North Carolina to another State, on an unbroken, in-terstate journey, on Sunday, is the Constitu-tional right of a citizen of the United States, and involves a Federal question pertaining to interstate legislation and cannot be lawfully regulated y the statute claimed to have been violated in this case by the defendant. That there is a contrariety of opinion between religionists as to which day of the week is the Lord's day for different religious reasons, as held by the ruling of the supreme court of this State. That the observation of the " Lord's day," as held by the ruling of the supreme court of this State, and the said stat-ute which arbitrarily fixes Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Lord's day, violates the natural and inalienable right of the defendant to worship Almighty God according to the dic-tates of her conscience, and therefore it is unconstitutional and void. That there are different classes of religionists who keep different days of the week for the Lord's day for different religious reasons, as held by the ruling of the supreme court of this State. That the observation of the Lord's day is, therefore, a church regulation and not subject to legislative definition. That the law in question undertakes to define which day of the week is the " Lord's day " when it says, " On the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday," etc., and is, therefore, religious legislation, and is unconstitutional in that it confers upon human authority the power to control or in-terfere with the rights of the conscience of the accused. That said law is religious legislation and void because it employs the same means for the observation of Sunday as the Lord's day that God himself has decreed in the ten command-ments for the observation of the Lord's day, or the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week. That enforced cessation of labor on Sunday for the observation of the Lord's day is religious legis-lation and controls or interferes with the nat-ural and inalienable rights of the accused.  That she has the Constitutional right to rAli
