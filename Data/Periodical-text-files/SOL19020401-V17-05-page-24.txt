("Sound Words." Continued from page z66) that divine command. There is the old theocracy, the union of church and state, tyranny creeping in again. The men who believe that God has ordered all people to keep Sunday after a certain fashion have a perfect right to persuade people to agree with them so far as they can; but they have no right to enforce it by law. Why? Consider the principle involved. The mayor of this city may be personally interested in the salvation of my soul; he ought to be. If he believes that I ought to do something in order to be saved, he ought, as a man, to do what he can to insure my sal-vation; but, so far as his office of mayor is concerned, it is none of his business whether my soul is saved or not. It is the business of the governor of this State, as an individual, to do what he can to save my soul, if he thinks it is in danger; but it is none of his business as governor. It is none of the business of the Government of the United States whether anybody's soul is saved or not, whether anybody goes to heaven or somewhere else: it is the business of the civil govern-ment only to see to it that we are good citizens. It is enough for any civil government to look after this world: it has no right to attempt to GOVERN THE NEXT. Civil government stops with the consideration of civic characteristics and conduct. So that, whatever anybody may believe to be true in regard to the divine command as to keeping Sunday in a particular way, it is his business to use his utmost persuasion to get others to agree with him; but he has no right to attempt to use force. Hands off from religious questions! The soul stands face to face with its God, and is accountable to God only for its religious opinions..
