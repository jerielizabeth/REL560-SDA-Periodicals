At the same time the coMpliea-tion of the prohibition of the liquor traffic on Sunday with that of other forms of business puts a club into the hands of the saloons, which they are not slow nor unsuccessful in using to foster;  and protect their nefarious ' Sunday reformers seem to be blind to this' fact.ŠEvangel and Sabbath Outlook. A NEW YORK club man is said to be au-thority fOr the 'statement that Cornelius Van-derbilt; has an idea that the anarchists and unemployed will one day rise up against the wealthy, and one of. the first points of attack Willbe the 'Vanderbilt mansion. The Van-derbilt house appears to itsowner, the club Man said, 'as:the place where, like the Tuileries in .the thnel of the commune, the mob will rush in at .one great gate on Fifty-seyenth Street, and, out the 'other one on Fifty-eighth, using the Widelalis as they did those of the French palace and 'applying the torch as they crowd through 'the building.' Mr...Vanderbilt's.  idea is probably not very - wideof.the.truth.; Certain it is that a time :iroOle is coming to the immensely wealthy. This is clearly foreshadowed by Holy Writ: to now, ye rielf'men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon. you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. james 5: 1-3. The,Itevised Version renders the text, "in the laSt,.daYs,' which makes it all the more significant; for never in the history of the world has there been such a heaping together of riches as during the last thirty years. rirrakAre OF THE CAT11.9!_tc,,,Asi!EpRcH.
