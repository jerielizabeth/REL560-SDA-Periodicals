Is there no parallel between the gag of the burglar and the gag of the law? Why does the burglar use a gag ? It is because he wants to get away with your goods, and he Coes not want you to make an outcry and call the neighbors. He knows he cannot convince you by argument that he is entitled to the goods, and that it is really to your best interest to pass them over to him."Š Jay Fox, in " Liberty and the Great Libertarians," pages 534, 535Ł
