252 AMERICAN SENTINEL. send the envoy, and this curious question was never But one is tempted to ask why the court of Rome does not ask a question of the courts of Spain and Por-tugal. All three of these courts hold steadily to the doctrine that the pope infallible. This means that no appeal can be made from his decision. He decided in 1493 that the Philippines, when discovered, should be-long to Portugal. By the merest blunder in calculation, Spain held them for two hundred and fifty years, sup-posing all the time that she was complying with his decree, Portugal supposing the same, and the popes acquiescing. But, in truth, since Anson's voyage, on the theory of both Spain and Portugal, the islands have belonged to Portugal. To this theory an infallible court must assent. The pope did not make the mistake in longi-tude. Indeed it may be doubted whether there ever was a pope who could calculate the longitude at all, let alone calculatelit correctly. If Portugal should to day put in a claim to the rev-enues of the. Philippines for four centuries, and for the $20,000,000 now paid for them by the United States, what possible reply could be made, either in interna-tional law or in the law of the Catholic Church? We shall be seriously indebted to any of our con-temporaries of the Catholic journals who will reply seri-ously to this question. It is not the old question whether Galileo was right or not. It is the question whyŠif Spain held for the centuries between Magellan and Anson to a grant made in 1493Šshe should not hold to it in the centuries between Anson and Cervera. The answer to this question should be easier to per-sons who believe that the pope's decision reflects for this world the Divine Omniscience. Such persons do not say that the pope cannot make a mistake. But they do say that no appeal lies from a decision make by the pope in council, like the bull of 1493. An Ambiguous Decision. New York "Christian Advocate." THE Supreme Court of Michigan has decided that reading without comment in the public schools from a book entitled, "Readings from the Bible," which is made up entirely of selections from the Bible, is clearly con-stitutional, especially where the pupils are not required to listen. Such is a dispatch sent out from Lansing, the capi-tal of Michigan, on the date on which the opinion was filed. If the "especially" is a part of the language of the decision, it is a Bunsby-like utterance. Summaries of decisions are frequently very delusive. No child is re- quired to listen to anything in a school. He is required to act as if he were listening, as a part of order, and may be punished for not learning what he is expected to recite. And no small child can listen unless what is said commands his attention. Comparatively few adults are disciplined to a point where they can listen to a wholly uninteresting reading from a person that they care nothing about. It can hardly be expected' that the Supreme Court will allow the children to make visible efforts not to listen. We await the full text of that decision, and it may prove that they meant that the children need not come to the school until after the reading. Something to Talk About. "New York Journal." Im is estimated that in 1890 there were 12,500,000 families in the United States, owning, in all, property worth $65,000,000,000. Of these, 125,000 families, or just 1 per cent. of the whole, owned $33,000,000,000, or more than all the rest of the people combined. Of the remaining $32,000,000,000, $23,000,000,000, or more than two thirds, were held by 1,375,000 families. That Ł left 11,000,000 families, of whom half owned $8,200,-000,000 and the other half only $800,000,000. - The 125,000 families at the top of the scale owned over forty one times as much property as the 5,500,000 families at the bottom, and nearly four times as much as 11,000,000 families, constituting seven-eighths of the population of the nation. That was nine years ago. The concentration of wealth has gone on at an enormously accelerated rate since then, and it is going on now faster than ever before. AN exchange reports the following:Š "There has been a disgraceful increase of prosecu-tions for Sabbath-breaking in England and Wales dur-ing the past twenty years. In 1878, under the law of Charles II., which dates back about two hundred and fifty years, the total number of prosecutions for Sunday trading was 597. In 1888 it was 2,549, and in 1897 it was 3,729. In the twenty years these prosecutions ag-gregated 45,587. The Reformer, which gives the number of prosecutions each year, does not say how many con-victions have been found, nor the amount of punishment in fines or imprisonment. No doubt the time spent in jail by Sabbath breakers would amount to a period much longer than the added terms of persons sentenced for leze-majesty in Germany, to the great horror of pious Britons, who ,vow that they will never be slaves."
