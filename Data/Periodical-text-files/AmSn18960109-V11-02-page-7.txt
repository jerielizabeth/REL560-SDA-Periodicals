JANUARY 9, 1896. SIEN971INIEIL4., 15 IN THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. The Standard Dictionary is Now an Authority in All the Departments at Washington and in Canada. ALTHOUGH the new Standard Dictionary has been published scarcely a year, it has been in use ft r several months in all the depart-ments of the United States Government at Washington, and also of the Dominion of Canada. The feeling of Government experts toward it is truly expressed by A. G. Wilkin-son, principal examiner in the United States Patent Office, and formerly professor of lan-guages in the University of Missouri. He says:Š The Standard Dictionary is so vastly superior that I can hardly say enough in its praise. It is the most perfect dictionary ever made in any language. Prof. A. II. Sayce, the eminent philologist, Oxford University, England, says:Š The Standard Dictionary is truly magnificent, and worthy of the great continent which produced it. It is more than complete. It is certain to supersede all other dictionaries of the English language. Prof. J. E. Sandys, Cambridge University, England, says:Š It is an admirable work, and deserves to become famous on both sides of the Atlantic. Hon. E. J. Phelps, Professor of law in Yale University, ex-Minister to Great Britain, says:Š The work is extemely well done throughout. For general and practical purposes it is the best American dictionary now available. Ł Prof. N. S. Shaler, Harvard University, says:-- The Standard Dictionary will remain an enduring monument to the labor of its editors. J. W. Bashford, President of Ohio Wes-leyan University, says:Š I say more emphatically than ever before that it is by far the best dictionary in the English language. It is safe to say that no one will make a mistake in buying the Standard. Address, FUNK & WAGNALLS COMPANY, 30 Lafayette Place, New York.

Other makes may be good, but the WATERMAN IS THE BEST. Some points of excellence are:Š The fine quality of the gold pens; The reliability of its feed, which has stood a ten years' test; The absence of any portion of the feed on the top of the pen point, whereby it Is left untrammeled and acts with all the ease and grace of any first-class gold pen. Among those who use the Waterman Pen are:Š REV. LYMAN ABBOTT, Editor "Christian Union," New York. CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW, Pres. N. Y. C. & H. R. R. Co. HON. W. E. GLADSTONE, Hawarden, England. JOHN WANAMAKER, Ex-Postmaster General. And housands of others whose judgment may safely be trusted, all of whom with one consent pronounce the Waterman t "111-11-1 B  144ST FOUNTAIN P_ENT." Among the many excellent features of this pen, to some of which we call a'tention, stands one of no mean value, and that is the shape of the holder There is, in the new style. no prominent collar or shoulder to come in contact with the fingers when, writing, but the holder has the pleasing touch of any ordinary good pen holder.

COON BROS.: I consider the "Cyclone Washer " far superior to any other washing machine before the public. It washes thorouchly. quickly. and does not wear out the clothes.

My husband has purchased one, and I am truly thankful, for I consider it a household treasure, Yours respectfully, MRS. E. P. Cann.  Beaver Dam, Wis, October 16, 1895. MEssns. Coos BROS.: Your Cyclone Washer seems to be the machine of all. It washes thoroughly, quickly, and easily. and without wearing the clothes as is proven by the fact that black clothes can be washed in the suds after white ones and receive no lint.
