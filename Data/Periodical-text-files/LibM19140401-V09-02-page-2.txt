We believe in God, in the Bible as the word of God, and in the separation it i2. We believe that the ten commandments are the law of God, and that they comprehend man's whole duty to God and man. 3. We believe that the religion of Jesus Christ is founded in the law of love j of God, and needs no human power to support or enforce it. Love cannot be forced. 4- We believe in civil government as divinely ordained to protect men in the 1 enjoyment of their natural rights and to rule in civil things, and that in this realm it is entitled to the respectful obedience of all. 5. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every individual to I worship or not to worship, according to the dictates of his own conscience, provided I that in the exercise of this right he respects the equal rights of others. 6. We believe that all religious legislation tends to unite church and state, is 1 subversive of human rights, persecuting in character, and opposed to the best inter-ests of both church and state. 7. We believe, therefore, that it is not within the province of civil government to legislate on religious questions. 8. We believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to pre-vent religious legislation, and oppose all movements tending to unite church anl I state, that all may enjoy the inestimable blessings of civil and religious liberty. g. We believe in the inalienable and constitutional right of free speech, free press, peaceable assembly, and petition. to. We also believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.
