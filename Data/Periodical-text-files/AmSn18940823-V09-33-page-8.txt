164    AlkfiRIMICAN sioNrirviNimr,. vol.. 9, No. 33.                NEW Your., AUGUST 23, 1894. 12VŠ ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE paragraphs quoted on page 260, from the Examiner, in condemnation of the persecution of Adventists under the Sunday laws of certain States, are from an article, the latter part of which is a weak defense of such statutes on so-called civil grounds. The Examiner's heart is in the right place, but the paper is not consistent throughout. LET no reader of the AMERICAN SENTI-NEL forget that during this hot weather an honest Christian man is languishing in a southern jail for no other offense than working on Sunday according to the ex-press command of God : " Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work." He had work to do and he did it; for this he is in prison and will be, if he lives, for months to come. THE Christian Statesman states that " under the regime of the present em-peror of Germany, a strict observance of the law forbidding manual labor on Sun-day is being enforced." That is not strange since it is written in the Word of God that all the world shall worship the papacy " whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb." Of course Germany will be no exception; it, too, - will exalt the Sunday, the badge of papal power. Ł Ł THE editor of the Salamanca News, for-merly the Bugle Horn, informs us that his paper " recognizes that there are other things deserving treatment as well as prohibition and woman suffrage,' and treats them, too," and asks, " Does the SENTINEL do likewise ?" Well, yes. In fact, as those subjects are generally treated they have never seemed to us to be very important, and we have given our atten-tion very largely to other issues. But that is no reason why the Bugle Horn, News, or whatever the thing may happen to be this week, should violate the ninth commandment. In referring to this paper it says : " If a person were to read the AMERICAN SENTINEL, he would be led to conclude that there was only one com-mandment, and that for the observance of the Sabbath." Now, the editor either knew when he wrote that he wrote a falsehood, or else he Łhad not read the SENTINEL, and so did not know whereof he affirmed. He can choose which horn of the dilemma he will take. The good Book says : " He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him." Our contemporary may not be malicious but only demonstrating the truth of the Scripture. IN a sermon in this city, July 29, Rev. Thomas Dixon said :Š The outlook for the immediate future is one of suffering and oppression. The capitalists will surely retaliate on the workingmen. They will triumph in their strength. Yet they should not imagine that they are safe from future violence. Another strike is bound to come. It will affect every industry and paralyze the world. I predict that a fearful struggle will occur in the near future. Thoughtful men everywhere take a similar view of the situation. The outlook is not promising from a worldly stand-point. But while men's hearts are "fail-ing them for fear and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth," the foundation of God stands sure. He will be the refuge of his people. THE Examiner, " the national Baptist newspaper," published in this city, has these pertinent words relative to the influ-ence of women in politics :Š One wonders what sort of women those are who are joining in " ovations " to Col. W. C. P. Breckinridge, the dissolute representative from Kentucky, who is now seeking reelection to Congress. The revolting conduct of which he was guilty, and of which he seems on the whole, rather proud, ought to exclude him for ever, not only from public life, but from the society of all pure-minded men and women. And yet, at a recent political gathering in his district, one hundred " ladies " are said to have been present, and to have lavished upon him the most fulsome flatteries. Is it in such ways as this that " woman's influence " is to purify politics 2 The fact is, as we have, before remarked in these columns, that men and women are both human, and it is vain to look to human nature for salvation from the evils of such nature. SENATOR GEORGE has introduced a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution, as follows:Š JOINT RESOLUTION To amend the Constitution in relation to hours of labor. Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following amendment to the Constitution of the United States be proposed to the legislatures of the several States, which, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States, shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of the Constitution of the United States: " Eight hours shall constitute a legal day's work for persons doing manual labor. No person, association, or corporation engaged in mining, manufacturing, or in any other mechanical pursuit or public work, or in transportation other than watercraft, shall require or permit any employ doing manual labor to work for such person, association, or corporation more than forty-eight hours in one week, except in cases of emergency prescribed by law. Persons voluntarily and lawfully engaged in any of the above pursuits shall not be unlawfully hindered or obstructed. " Congress shall enforce this provision by appro-priate legislation." It seems that two things are to be ac-complished by this resolution; first, six days is to constitute a week of labor; and, second, it is to give the United States undoubted jurisdiction over all labor diffi-culties. How far it can be manipulated in the interests of Sunday remains to be  seen and will depend very much on the legislatio'n enacted under it, should it be-come a part of the fundamental law of the land. THE Philadelphia Inquirer, of July 31, has this significant paragraph concerning the trouble between China and Japan :Š Supposing that England and Germany took up the cause of China, and Japan refused to take their advice with the backing of the czar, and supposedly that of France, there would be a war such as the earth never felt before. With 10,000,000 European soldiers, armed and equipped in the latest manner, added to the countless millions of China and Japan, and with sev-eral hundred modern warships, there would ensue a war that would bear out all the terrible prophecies of the Apocalypse. This does not seem probable just now, but the general war referred to as a sub-ject of prophecy will surely come. The Word of God cannot fail. But whether it comes now or a little later the para-graph quoted shows the state of mind which prevails very largely everywhere. General forebodings fulfill the words of our Lord: " Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that are coming on the earth." " THE Legal Aspect of Sunday : Its History and Character," is the title of No. 22 of the Religious Liberty Library. The work is by James T. Ringgold of the Baltimore Bar, who is not a stranger to the readers of the SENTINEL. The author dis-cusses the historical, moral and constitu-tional aspect of the question so exhaust-ively as to leave " no point untouched and no question unsolved." The work is dedicated to members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, though as the preface declares, "the author is not a member of that communion." Though holding views of this question similar to those held by members of this church they are not borrowed from them, since Mr. Ringgold published a legal work embodying these views long before he knew that there was such a people holding them. The matter is divided into seventeen chapters which, together with the prefaces and a very interesting supplement on the present " fad " of " clerical slumming," make a book of 262 pages. The work is a verit-able digest of the Sunday law fallacies with their complete refutation. Price 40 cents, with usual discounts to dealers.
