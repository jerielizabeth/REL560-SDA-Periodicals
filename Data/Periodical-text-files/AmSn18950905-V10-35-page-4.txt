        VOL. 10, No. 35.              lawyers of the town, including the ex-judge of the Superior Court, said at the time, there was not a shadow of doubt about its being done when the case was reached,Šthat the judge would have to do it; he could not do otherwise. That was, as stated, nearly two years ago, and the case has been pending ever since. In the meantime a new judge has come to the bench, who is a Baptist minister, and who, before reaching our case, had threatened.  Seventh-day Adventists. And now word comes from our attorney * at Gainesville that this same minister-judge has passed upon our cases, affirms the decision of the mayor, and holds that we were properly convicted. I noticed in a recent issue of the SENTINEL, an inquiry from a Baptist as to whether, in the cAses of persecution against our people,Šwhich are becoming so common,Šany of his denomination had ever been guilty of taking part in it. Here is an instance the brother might take note of, where a Baptist, as judge on the benchŠand a minister, tooŠhas used his high office for this express purpose, and without the warrant of a shadow of law at that. What are we to expect next ? Our lawyer thinks that he may possibly get the city to remit the fines, and if not, he is ready to take the case on up to the Supreme Court if we desire it. Failing in both these efforts, it means ninety days each for Professor Keck and myself in a Georgia chain-gang, which, though so nearly realized at different times by our brethren there, has been escaped so far, but which, with the possibilities for oppression and cruel treatment to chain-gang convicts under the laws of that State, makes it decidedly the most forbidding condition that has yet confronted any of ourŁ people in this country. But if this is God's will, he will give grace for it. W. A. McCurrenEx. religious matters, the only difference being that the one was done under the influence of Romanism during the Dark Ages and the other is being done in an enlightened age, supposed to be under the control of Christian Protes-tantism. As to difference in principle, there is none. I am not an Adventist, but a member of the Baptist Church, and seek to observe the day generally regarded as the Christian Sunday; but this does not change my views as regards the right and justice of allowing perfect reli-gious freedom for every human being of our supposed-to-be-free country. In accordance with the intent and spirit of both the State and National constitutions, and all intelligent teachings of the Bible, we have no just right to interfere with the religious belief or actions of others, proyided they do not disturb the general well-being of others, all unjust and prejudiced decisions of the Supreme or other courts to the contrary not-withstanding. And those very good(?) people who allow themselves to be disturbed by the action of others at their own homes, and on their own premises, may be likened to the young women who claimed to be insulted by nude boys bathing in view of their homes but so far away that they could only be distin-guished from hogs or some other animals through the use of a field glass or telescope, which the said girls used to learn what they were! In accordance with the direct teachings of the Bible, these Seventh-day Adventists have good authority for claiming Saturday, or the last day of the week, to be the day of rest des-ignated by God himself. The true origin of the Sabbath, or the day of rest, was through the work that God did in six days, and his rest from this work on the seventh, which for thousands of years was regarded by God's people as the proper day of rest, and so ob-served. This being true, and it also being true that there is no direct or divine author-ity in the Bible or elsewhere for changing it as a day of rest, the Adventists certainly have a fair basis for their doctrine in this particular. Paul the apostle says, " One man esteemeth one day above another, another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." The truth of the matter is, there is not a human being on earth, so far as is known, who can tell which is the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh day of the week, coming in regular order in accordance with God's ar-rangement of the days during and after the creation. Nor do I believe that it can be positively known which is the first or the sev-enth day of the week, in accordance with the arrangement of time during the days of Christ our Saviour upon the earth. Therefore when we all may be mistaken, why should a few be persecuted for their honest convictions as re-gards the day that should be properly observed as a day of rest? But then suppose there is a law upon our statute books forbidding labor on the day gen-erally observed as sabbath, which, as the judge says, " should be upheld," why is it that steam-boats, railroads, street-car lines, hotels, livery-stables, hackmen and other money-making concerns can continue their various vocations without the least fear of molestation by the officers of the law, whilst another class of true and good citizens must be persecuted for doing what others are promiscuously allowed to do? Can any public official or Christian, man or woman, give an intelligent answer as to why such things should be in this age of Christianity? G. H. SLAUGHTER. St. Bethlehem, Tennessee. IS IT SINGULAR?   BISHOP A. G. HAYGOOD, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, said in commenting upon the prosecution of Adventists in Tennes-see: " Singularly these violators of civil law Šclaiming conscience for keeping SaturdayŠseem to have no conscience about breaking the law of the State their citizenship binds them to support." Is it singular that a Christian, acting in the fear of God, refuses to do wrong, even though a law of the land commands it ? Is it not a singular kind of a conscience which would dictate a blind obedience to every human en-actment which might assume the form of law, even though as bad as the fugitive slave law, or some law of heathen lands? Would a Christian be thus bound by his conscience in China ? Or were the early Christians so bound under the laws of pagan Rome ? If so, their martyrdom was due to their own folly. Christians have always disregarded human laws when they were clearly contrary to the law of God. The Christian's conscience can not be separated from that law, for that is the eternal rule of right. That would be a singu-lar kind of conscience which would make human law its guide, taking no account of the law of God. That is not the kind possessed by the Adventists. CAN SUCH THINGS BE?  [From the Evening News, Paterson, N. J., July 23.] WE are apt to boast that these United States are a land of freedom and religious liberty and that under the shadow of our glorious starry flag every man may worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience provided he does not disturb others in the enjoyment of the same rights. And yet in this, as in some other things, our boast is without foundation. Eight honest men, who, being Seventh-day Adventists, keep Saturday as the Sabbath, have been condemned to serve ninety days each in the common jail, and besides this are compelled to labor in the chain-gang with confirmed criminals. The crime of these men was working on the the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. This outrage upon civil and religious liberty has not been committed in Russia, but right here in the United States, in this year of grace, 1895, and these victims of intolerance are in jail at Dayton, Rhea County, Tennessee. Some of our readers may wonder how it is that seventh-day observers in Tennessee can be punished so severely when the only statute forbidding Sunday labor provides for a fine of but three dollars, recoverable before a justice of the peace. The explanation lies in the fact that the Supreme Court of the State has de-cided that a repetition of Sunday work con-stitutes a "nuisance," and is indictable. And to carry this judicial legislation further, Judge Parks has decided that " a single act of work done under such circumstances as to amount to a nuisance, is indictable and pun-ishable as such." The term " such circum-stances " is explained by the judge in the next sentence to mean " in such a public manner as to be open to the observation of the public." The only crime charged against one of these men was that he assisted to lift a wheelbarrow from a wagon into a yard on Sunday, and for this he is serving seventy-five days in the chain-gang! And this in Tennessee, United States of America. This in " the land of the free." If it had been in Russia, Poland or Turkey, our surprise would not have been as great.  EX-SENATOR SLAUGHTER'S OPINION.  [THE following letter, which appeared in the Amer-ican, of Nashville, Tenn., is from a gentleman who was a member of the Tennessee Senate, two years ago, and who at that time introduced a bill designed to put an end to the injustice against which he still earnestly protests. ] To the American : I see in your paper of July 4 (the anniver-sary of American Independence), where, in one of the counties of this State, true and good citizens are being persecuted for acting in ac-cordance with their religious convictions of right, as dictated to them by the holy Word of God. And, as stated, one of these poor per-secuted people is " a mere boy, who works in the mines all the week, and in the support of a widowed mother and aunt, was only charged with cutting stovewood for his mother's use." Oh, what a terrible crime! I very much regret to know that such a wrong has occurred in Tennessee, and also that there are two men in the State holding such high and responsible offices as judge and at-torney-general who will allow the prosecution of these people, not in the interest of justice and right, but only for the purpose of uphold-ing one of the most unjust and ignominious laws ever placed upon the statute books of any State. It does look to me like going back to the days of the Spanish Inquisition, when people were burned at the stake and otherwise made to suffer torture and death, only because of their honest convictions of right as regards * These men employed an attorney simply to .guard their rights in the appel ate court. They argued their own cases both before the mayor and in the County Court.
