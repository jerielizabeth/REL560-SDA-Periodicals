) ) LIBERTY â€š's BABY EMPEROR, RULER OF 450,000,000 PEOPLE state. Again, at just what juncture can the state step iri between a man and his business activity and say, Your busi-ness is absorbing too much of your at-. tention so that you are losing your ap-preciation of individual worth ; you must diminish your activity "? When government reaches the point where it can pass laws based upon the effect of a man's business activity on his own soul, it will have reached a point in pa-ternalism beyond which none of the most paternal governments of old have ever gone.
