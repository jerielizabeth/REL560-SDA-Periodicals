But it seems to me that this scholarly and venerable pioneer, who was publishing an illustrated magazine devoted largely to the themes he celebrates, when many of the younger authors were still at their nurse's knee, is the one man who is entitled, by his culture, his fine tastes, and above all, his long and wonderful experience, to write the one great and responsible authority about the Heart of the ' Sierras. ŠJOAQUIN MILLER. " The illustrations, the text, the whole atmosphere of the volume, are worthy of their great subject, the Yo SemiteŠand what could I say more? "ŠREV. JOSEPH COOK.

History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know how to avoid error in the future must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the con-dition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these Principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the Standard of pure Christianity, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of paganism, It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book. Fine English cloth, substantially bound, contains about 400 pages, and will be sent post-paid at the nominal price of $1.00. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 43 BOND STREET, NEW YORE,
