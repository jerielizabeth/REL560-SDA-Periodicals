THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 207 in fact every one who makes Sunday a business day will have to settle before the court, as it is intended to make a crusade against them." Tip; Denver Daily News in an editorial on Sun-day closing at the World's Fair, has this paragraph ; " Let us hope that the contest over Sunday as related to the World's Fair will go to the root of the business, and result in a recognition of the un-doubted rights of the people. The wisdom of rest-ing one day out of seven is conceded by everybody, but all legal regulations on the subject in this country should be, and rightfully can only be, based on civil and secular grounds. Matters re-lating to supernatural affairs rest absolutely with the individual, distasteful as that theory is to certain of the clergy, who have not yet become emanci-pated from the old and ferocious spirit of persecu-tion." AT a meeting of the Associated Trades of New York, resolutions were adopted in reference to the World's Fair, expressing an interest in its behalf, and expressing themselves as "unalterably opposed to the proposed project looking to the closing on Sundays of this great educator of the masses, in-dustrial art and mechanical science. ".resolved, That in the name of the toilers of the country, we protest against such a sacrifice and denial of their right to examine and study the work and skill of their brother toilers of the earth, on the only day when their time is their own, and their mind is in its most receptive condition to perceive the larger lessons which the dignity, im-portance, and necessities of the labor world ever teach." A PITTSBURG justice has been found who is will-ing to step in to the rescue of the overworked de-tectives of this country, and say that they can not with impunity be compelled to labor seven days in the week. To be sure the course of Alderman Bleichner does seem to point out an inconsistency in the course of the Law and Order League, but that is to be given to the higher courts to explain away. This is the item, from the Pittsburg Dis-patch: "Harry Shellhorn, alias Horn, alias Ho-mer, the Law and Order detective, was fined twenty-five dollars and costs, by Alderman Bleich-ner yesterday for following his business on Sunday. He is the same man who has figured several times in the local courts. Agent McClure, it is said, declares the decision will not hold, and will appeal the case for his satellite." Louts GOLDSMITH, a Hebrew, of Toronto, On-tario, has been fined five dollars and costs by the police magistrate for allowing a number of em-ployes, all Hebrews, to work on Sunday. The magistrate admitted that it was a hardship that Jews who kept their own Sabbath should be com-pelled to also observe the Christian Sunday, but such was the law. Henry Cohen, a Hebrew tailor, was also fined for cutting cloth in his store on Sunday. There is an interesting coincidence of thought and expression between the Canadian and the Tennes-see judges, and a startling similarity of conclusion which bodes no good to the dissenter for conscience' sake. IT is reported that the Toronto Baptist Associa-tion has passed a resolution requesting the Cana-dian Government to prohibit the opening of the Canadian exhibit at the World's Fair on Sunday.
