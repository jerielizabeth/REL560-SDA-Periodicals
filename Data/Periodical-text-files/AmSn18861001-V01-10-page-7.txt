THE AMERICAN*  SENTINEL. 79 Religious Teaching by the State. CONCEDE the principle that religion, either as an end or a means, falls properly within the administrative agency of the State, and the in-ference is irresistible that the State must have a religion to administer; that it must deter-mine what that religion shall be; and that it must and should appoint suitable persons to do the executive part of the work. We have no difficulty with the natural and necessary modes ormaking the principle effective-none what-ever-since they result from it by inevitable se-quence. Nor have we any scruples about the so-called rights of dissentient minorities, since there are no such rights, provided the principle be a sound one. They have no right to be talking about the rights of conscience against the just exercise of the powers of the State. They are by the very terms of the case mere grumblers. The administration of religion be-ing one of the functions of the State, then the -State must, of course, follow its own conscience, just as it does when it hangs a murderer; and the individual who, on the score of his private conscience, gets in the way of the State con-science, must get out of the way or be crushed by it. He has no right to arrest or control the action of the State conscience with his private judgment, since the former is only exercising its legitimate powers and discharging its duty. It is a Mere farce to talk, about the rights of an individual and unofficial conscience against the operations of a government that is acting within the scope of its appropriate powers. There can be no such rights in consistency with the existence of government. Where a government has jurisdiction it must judge of its own duties. Grant that religion comes within.this jurisdiction, and that is the end of the question. The procedures in asserting and exercising it follow as a matter of course. Our great difficulty with the doctrine of those who demand that the State shall become a re-ligious propagandist in its school system, is with the principle that lies at its bottom, and not at all. with the details of its execution, however stringent or seemingly severe, provided they are necessary to the end. Their doctrine logic-ally commits them to the principle of State jurisdiction and State duties in respect to things spiritual; and if they refuse to accept the con-sequences, no matter whether they are Prot-estants or Catholics, then they are afraid of their own creed. If, on the other hand, they carry out the principle and make it a living and operative power, And not a mere sham for the sake of appearances, then, alas ! for the real rights of conscience and the liberties of men, they land us, body and soul, into the sys-tem of State religion-namely, religion defined by the State, taught by the, State, supported as a .charge upon its treasury, and, if necessary, penally enforced by the State. This is all very well for them, since they always assume their religion and that of the State to be identical. How would it be if the fact were just the re-verse? This question, bigotry, whether in a Catholic or a Protestant bosom, seldom has time to consider. When Protestant and Puri-tan New England hung witches and persecuted Quakers, and when Roger Williams was ban- ished from his home on pain of death, things moved along very finely for the religionists in power; but not as smoothly with the victims of their mistaken and maddened zeal. The prin-ciple upon which these religionists acted, being conceded and developed, with no limitations ex-cept those furnished by itself, sets the State to doing a thing which does not belong to it and which, if it be true to its own position, will be sure to make it a persecuting power. Macaulay well says that " the experience of many ages proves that men may be ready to fight to the death and to persecute without pity for a religion whose creed they do not under-stand, and whose precepts they habitually dis-obey." Many a dark chapter in history con-firms the truth of this remark. The moment religion is in any way armed with the civil power the fatal step is taken. We deny the rightfulness of the power in this connection by entering a universal demurrer to its action. We deny that the State has the right to tax the Jew to propagate Christianity, or to make infidels help to liquidate the ex-pense account of a religion which they repudi-ate. We place this denial on the broad ground that religion in itself, in its very nature, in the processes of its culture and promotion, in its re-lations to God and the interests of another life, lies above and beyond the jurisdiction of the -State, unless God himself has constituted that State. The State is not an exhorter, or a per-suader, or a debating club, but a positive law power for secular purposes; and, hence, when it attempts to administer religion it must of necessity give to it the law force, deciding what religion is true and by what methods it shall be promoted. There is no escape from this result if we admit the principle from which it springs; and, the principle being true, then the result is right. If religious teaching is really one of the'  proper functions of the State, then all that is necessary to the end, of which the State itself must be the judge, is included therein. More-over, the implications of the function need only to be fully drawn out to cover the whole ground of State religion, with all its ways and means. To the authority of the State when acting within its appropriate sphere every citizen should cheerfully bow, supporting it, if neces-sary, by the sword. If it be a democratic State, the will of the majority, legally expressed, should be the rule for the whole. But when the State engages in the work of religious teaching, whether in the public school or else- where, and does the things which must be done to realize the end, then it not only disowns the elementary- principles of a democratic govern- ment, but is guilty of a legal usurpation, against which every lover of liberty, be he saint or sin-ner, Protestant or Catholic, ought to protest in thunder-notes.-Samuel T. Spear, D. D. NATIONS have sincere piety only in those countries where one may love God and the Christian religion with one's whole soul with-out losing, and especially without obtaining, any worldly advantage by, the manifestation of that sentiment.-Madame De Stael.
