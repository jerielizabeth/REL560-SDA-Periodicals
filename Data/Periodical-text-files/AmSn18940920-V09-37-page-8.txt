23 A.mirtircANT s=qrptiq-MIL. Vol- 6, O. NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 20, 1894. ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE article, " Fostering the Savage in the Young," which we reproduce on another page, in greatly abridged form from the Arena for August, deserves a careful reading, not alone for the facts which it states, but because it is a protest by a secular journal against the evil course of professed Christians. Nothing marks the decay of primitive Christianity more plainly than do these military organ-izations in the bosom of the popular but spiritually fallen churches. And our pub-lic schools, when military drill shall have been introduced into them, will be a good place for Christians not to send their children. The young should be trained in the arts of peace, not in the art of war; they should be taught how to save life, not how to destroy it. AMONG the many unscriptural doc-trines of the Roman Catholic Church, one of the most pernicious is the dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary. What the doctrine is was told in these col-umns June 7. It is further discussed this week. Let no reader fail to familiar-ize himself with this subject; for- whoever accepts the immaculate conception of Mary, by the same act surrenders the Christ of the New Testament. If Mary was without sinful tendencies then Christ is without human sympathy, not being as the Scriptures declare he is, " touched with the feeling of our infirmities;" nor could he, in that case, have been "tempted like as we are." Surely he who accepts this doctrine must with it adopt the sad lament, " They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him." A ROMAN Catholic paper, the Pilot, under date of September 1, writes thus of the death of that student of history, Eugene Lawrence :Š Eugene Lawrence, whose death, a week or two ago, scarcely received a two-line notice in the papers, knew more history that wasn't so than almost any man of his generation. Twenty odd years ago he and Thomas Nast delighted tho more bigoted readers of Harper's Weekly by their scurrilous insults to Catholics; but Harper's did not find it profitable in the long run, and concluded to dispense with the services of both blackguards several years ago. Yes, Eugene Lawrence is dead, but his book, " Historical Studies," still lives, and contains " more history " that the papacy wishes " wasn't so " than almost any book of his generation. Yes; the Pilot is right; it has become unpopular and unprofitable to publish magazines and standard works which tell the truth about  the papacy; but we know of a people who are not in the publishing business for pelf or popularity, but from principle, and they will continue to publish the truth though truth tellers die, and truth telling be unprofitable., WE did not expect that any Baptist would defend the prosecution of otherwise inoffensive Christians for labor on the first day of the week that disturbs nobody else. The Baptist and Reflector, of Nash-ville, however, undertakes to justify this persecution in the State of Tennessee, which is similar to the cases that have recently occurred in Maryland and Georgia. It would have been easy, by the use of similar arguments, for those who persecuted Baptists in the past, to have justified their conduct and policy. If there is any body of Christians that has solemnly and stoutly protested against such persecution, no matter who were its victims or its authors, it is the Baptists. We have never before seen an attempt at justification of religious persecution in the Baptist Church newspaper. We hope never to see one again.ŠThe Examiner, September .18. THE article on another page, "Catholics and Social Action," is deserving of careful attention, not because of any merit in it, but because of the significance of the facts which it states. No pope of modern times has labored so untiringly as has Leo XIII. to make the papacy necessary to the governments of the earth. Papal rehabilitation has been the supreme object of his reign; and that the papacy has regained very much of its lost prestige under his leadership, cannot be denied. It is asserted, and truthfully so, too, that the papacy has designs on this coun-try; that for years it has been the delib-erate purpose of Rome to dominate the United States in the interest of " the true church." But this is not all ; Rome means that her sway'shall be universal, and Leo XIII. has left no act undone, no word unspoken, the tendency of which would be to advance the interests of the papacy. Personal qualities and political and social conditions have alike been favorable to the designs of the present pope. A born diplomat, he is personally grates to the crowned heads and rulers of the world. Moreover the times have been favorable to the ambition of the pope to become arbitrator of the world. Peoples have been uneasy and rebellious, and rulers have been perplexed and troubled by domestic broils and problems, while for years the nations have been armed to the teeth, ready at a word to rush to battle, each bent on the destruction or subjuga-tion of its neighbors. Of course each nation has been deeply concerned to retain the loyalty of its people, and to make friends wherever it could. Thus the  papacy, which holds in its hands the alle-giance of millions in every land, has be-come, as never before since the Reforma-tion, a supposed necessity to the rulers of the world. THE article, "Absence of Faith in Prot-estantism," printed on another page, under " Significant Paragraphs," contains much food for reflection. Is there or is there not a vital principle in Protestantism ? Are there or are there not vital reasons in the minds of their votaries, for the exist-ence of the several sects of Protestantism ? The denomination that does not hold doc-trines, a steadfast belief in which is vital to the Christian life, has no reason for existence. Christian charity means love for God and for souls for whom Christ died, not indifference to the truths of God's Word. To change one's religion from convic-tion is noble, and honors God ; but to do so as a mere matter of convenience or of wordly profit is ignoble, and dishonors God. Luther said : " I consent. . . . to resign my person and my life to the emperor's disposal; but the Word of God Šnever !" How different this from the course pursued by so many so-called Prot-estants of to-dayŠby the scions of royalty no more than by thousands of others, just as responsible to God as though of royal blood. But the fault is not attributable, as the Monitor supposes, to Protestantism, but to the denial of the fundamental principle of Protestantism, which is that " there is no sure doctrine but such as is conformable to the Word of God; that the Lord for-bids the teaching of any other doctrine." Inspired by this conviction, many of the German princes of Luther's day, noble father's of a degenerate posterity, said to their royal kindred :Š We PROTEST by these presents, before God, our only Creator, Preserver, Redeemer, and Saviour, and who will one day be our Judge, as well as before all men and all creatures, that we, for us, and for our people, neither consent nor adhere in any manner whatever to the proposed decree, in anything that is contrary to God, to his holy Word, to our right conscience, to the salvation of our souls, and to the last decree of Spires. But not so the degenerate Protestantism of to-day which makes merchandise of faith and thereby gives to the enemies of the Lord great occasion to blaspheme. Two well-known Boston clubmen were arrested at Weston, Mass., on the 4th inst. for playing golf on the previous Sunday. AMERICAN SENTINEL.
