A European on the Vatican Negotiations and Catholicism in the United States Editor TWO articles of special interest to those who are watching the grow-ing influence of the Papacy as respects the United States, and, indeed, the world, have recently appeared in The Independent. They were written by Salvatore Cortesi, of Rome, who appears to be thoroughly impartial and very well informed regarding the matters concern-ing which he writes. Both were called forth by, and one treats directly upon, "The First American Mission to the Vatican," a heading which, if it does not imply, at least suggests, that there may be more American missions of the same description. In this article, with which appears a half-tone reproduction of the mosaic picture sent by the Pope to Presi-dent Roosevelt, though it is stated that "the position of Judge Taft in Rome was very difficult to define," the following clear-headed observations are made with reference to the contention that there was nothing whatever of a diplomatic nature about the mission : From Washington they had taken great pains to proclaim that the mission of the Gov-ernor of the Philippines had not the least dip-lomatic character, the Constitution not allow-ing the United States to entertain relations of that kind with any head of any religion. However, Judge Taft was provided with cre-dentials and with an autograph letter from President Roosevelt to Leo XIII, exactly like Mr. Whitelaw Reid for the coronation of King Edward VII, or like Lord Denbigh, the special envoy of England, who, similarly to Judge Taft, congratulated the Pope on his twenty-five years of pontificate. The American repre-sentative seemed in reality more of a special envoy than the other two, as he even had a present from the President to the Pope, con-sisting in a set of the literary works of the  former, and the instructions given to him by Secretary Root ended precisely as follows : "Any assistance which you may desire, whether on the part of officers of the civil government or of military officers, to enable you to per-form the duties above described (the negotia-tions with the Vatican) in a manner satisfac-tory to yourself, will be afforded." It is out of the question that no ambassador, no envoy extraordinary, has such powers as these. Be-sides, once in Rome, Governor Taft thought it his duty to be the first to pay visits to the ambassadors of France, Austria, Spain and Portugal, accredited to the Holy See, thus put-ting himself on an equality with them. A few days after he arrived in the Eternal City there was a consistory at the Vatican, which is one of the most gorgeous and im-portant functions of the Roman Church, and Governor Taft accepted an invitation to assist at it in the diplomatic tribune, together with, the ambassadors of the great Catholic powers, he being styled the Envoye Extraordinaire of the President of the United States. There-fore at the same time that in Washington they were emphatically denying the mission having anything to do with diplomacy, its head, either through the influence of the Roman atmos-phere, or with the view of reaching a success superior to that which he eventually obtained, was acting as though he had that diplomatic character which his government seemed so anxious to deny him. This writer goes on to say that there was evidently a fear on the part of the American authorities that the Italian government would look upon the mis-sion and negotiations as a recognition of the Pope's temporal sovereignty, and thus "be offended at the new departure." He shows that the apprehension of thus giving offense was needless, not because the Italian government would not take that view of the matter, but because it would not be offended at such recogni-
