Read what Others Say of it: 4--4ŁŁ "Many books have been written about the glorious and wondrous story of the Sierras. But it seems to me that this scholarly and venerable pioneer, who was publishing an illustrated magazine devoted largely to the themes he celebrates, when many of the younger authors were still at their nurse's knee, is the one man who is entitled, by his culture, his fine tastes, and, above all, his long and wonderful experience, to write the one great and responsible authority about the Heart of the Sierras."ŠJOA QUIN MILLER, the Noted Author and Correspondent. "The illustrations, the text, the whole atmosphere of the volume, are worthy of their great subject, the Yo SemiteŠand what could I say more?"ŠRE V. JOSEPH COOK, of Boston. "It is a truthful, interesting, and instructive work."ŠGALEN CLARK, Yo Semite Valley. (For sixteenyears the Valley's Guardian.) "As might have been expected, Mr. Hutchings' story of the Valley that he knows and loves so well, is no cold description, but reads with all the charms of a romance."ŠSan Francisco Hotel Gazette. "Those who have not seen Yo Semite cannot do better, short of going to the Valley, that by purchasing Mr. Hutchings' handsome volume."ŠThe Sacramento Record-Union.

Alonzo T. Jones, in behalf of the rights of American citizens, and in opposition to the Blair Sunday-Rest Bill, which Mr. Jones pre-sented before the Senate Committee on Educa-tion and Labor, December 13, 0358. Dr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "Mighty Interesting Reading." And Mr. Jones's comments will make it more so. his argument is enlarged to what it would have without Senator Blair's interruptions, ob-jec ins, and counter-arguments, and is accom-pllAied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially Legislators, Lawyers, Judges, and other public men. The argument is based on scripture and history, constitution and law, showing the limits of the civil power, the uncon-stitutionality of the Sunday Bill, an analysis of the Sunday Laws and other religious legislation of the differentStates, the Sunday Law movement of the fourth century, the Sunday Law movement of the nineteenth century, the methods used in securing indorsements to the petition for the Blair Bill, and the workings of such Sunday laws as are proposed for the United States.
