Undermining Foundations MINERS AND SAPPERS AT WORK The right to think, to know, and to utter is the dearest of all liberties. Without this right, there can be no liberty to any people; with it there can be no slavery. Wendell Phillips. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe. . . .

To limit the press is to insult the nation; to prohibit the reading of certain books is to declare the inhabitants to be either fools or slaves.Š Helvelius.
