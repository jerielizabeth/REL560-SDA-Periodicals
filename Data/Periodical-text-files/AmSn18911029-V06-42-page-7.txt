This Work, the demand for which has been so great as to wear out two sets of plates, has now been put in entirely new form. The book having become an accepted classic in devotional literature, it was thought wise to issue this new edition in a compact form, and in a variety of bindings. Oc-casion has also been taken by the author to thor-oughly revise the whole work, besides adding con-siderable new matter. Few Books of a Religious Character have been accorded such Hearty and Universal Indorsement. " To commend this work would seem almost superfluous ; and yet to young Christians who may not know it, we can not refrain from saying, Buy this book, and keep it with your Bible for constant study, until you have thoroughly mastered, in your own experience, the secret' of which it tells. It will trans-form the dark days of your life, as it has transformed those of thousands before you, into days of heavenly light."ŠNew York Evangelist. "We have not for years read a book with more delight and profit. The author has a rich experience, and tells it in a plain and delightful manner."ŠChristian Advocate.
