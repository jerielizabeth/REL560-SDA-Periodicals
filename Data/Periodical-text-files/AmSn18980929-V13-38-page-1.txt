NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 29, 1898. NUMBER 38. YOLUME 13: "IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT."--Jesus Christ. THE LOVE OF POWER AND THE POWER OF LOVE, THESE are opposite principles, which are constantly exemplified in the controversy between righteousness and sin. The one is Christian, the -other is antichristian. The one brought the Prince of glory from his throne in heaven down to hang upon the cross as a malefactor; the other exalted a man from among his fellows to a position of supreme authority over them, so that he receives their worship as a god. The love of power in the Christian Church led the disciples to dispute as to which should be the greatest, which dispute led finally to the exaltation of the bishop of Rome to the supreme place, as pope. This was the result of politics in the Christian Church. But the true power of the church, which alone she may rightfully employ, is not political power or any worldly power, but the power of the cross of Christ. THE surrender of conscience can be properly made only to the Word of God. POLITICSŠ worldly governmentŠrepresents strife. Christianity represents peace. An individual attains success in the one by sell-exaltation, in the other by self-,sacrifice. WHEN the church seeks for worldly honor and sup-port, she has forgotten that "the servant is not greater than his Lord." THE greatest height to which a man can be exalted by men, does not bring him any nearer to God than he was before.
