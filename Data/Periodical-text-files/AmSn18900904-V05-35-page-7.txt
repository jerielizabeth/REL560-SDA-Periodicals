GOOD FOR ALL TIME! 411 NATIONAL SUNDAY LAW THIS PAMPHLET CONTAINS THE ARGUMENTS IN BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BLAIR SUNDAY- REST BILL, WHICH MR. JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, DECEMBER 13, 1888. Mr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published `MIGHTY INTERESTING READING." And Mr. Jones' comments make it more so. His largument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially Legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is based on Scripture and history, constitution and law, showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-Law Movement of the Fourth Century, AND THE Sunday-Law Movement of the Nineteenth Century. The Methods Used in Securing Indorsements to the Petition for the Blair Bill, and the Workings of Such Sunday Laws as are Proposed for the United States.

Dr. John Thompson (general Bible agent for the Pacific Coast), described the quiet Sabbath he spent in Virginia City, Nevada. Five saloons were running, but there were no places of business open. He returned to California sick at heart, because we in Cal- ifornia had no Christian Sabbath, and thi's he repeated several times. Your correspondent, in conversa-tion with him afterward, ex-Tressed surprise at the statement, and asked Mr. Thompson if he did not' keep what he believed to be: the " Christian Sabbath ?" Why, ,certainly," was the reply. " How is it then," was asked, "`yen have no,Christian Sabbath here in_ California ?" The Legis-lature, he said, had not given them one. " Then," it was asked, " do you receive your religion and religious institutions, and Matters of faith, from the Leg-islature ? " It is to such pitiable :shifts that the logic of their madness drives them. In the evening, a mass-meeting -was addressed by Miss Coral:A. Tarr, of Chicago, Dr. Edward.  Thompson (District Secretary), and Bishop John P. Newman, of New York. Bishop Newman urged that the issue be made on a non-secular day, a day of rest. Dr. Thompson gave a glowing account of what had' been accom-plished in Southern California in the closing of saloons on ,Sunday. Miss Tarr spoke of women's work in the Sunday movement. The strength of the Sunday cause is not to be estimated by these illy - managed meetings. While there. is much division in the ranks in many respects, to all, great is the disidcratum of some kind of a Sunday law. It will require some effort to convert California, but as Mrs. Bateham said, " the leaven is working," the baleful, poisonous, corrupting influence of religious legislation. M. C. WILCOX.
