604 AMERICAN SENTINEL. The Holy Spirit and Sunday.ŠNo. 5. BY C. H. KESLAKE. THE Reformation. Whence was it? When Martin Luther waŁs led out to denounce the iniquitous practices which he saw prevalent in the Cath-olic Church; when he was constrained to proclaim at the risk of his life, that the Catholic method of justification was wrong and a fraud, and with it preached the true doctrine of justification by faithŠsomething that the Catholic Church up to that time bad never heard of, which was "not to be found in any of the creeds, or in the canons of any General Council" (Catholic Belief page 359); when Luther seceded from the pope and the Cath-olic Church, and when at Wittemburg, in the College Hall, he stood before the students, and solemnly declared: "If you do not combat with your whole heart the pope's impious government, you cannot be saved. Whosoever shall please himself with the religion and the worship of popedom will be lost forever in the life to come;" when certain of the princes, believing the principles taught by Luther, united their interest with his, and finally at the Diet of Spires, 1529, read the celebrated protest against the government of the pope, the reading of which won for them the name of Protestants, and from which in part at least, the founders of our government, adopted the idea of a "government of the people, by the people, and for the people;" when all this was being accom-plished,Šwhen, to sum it all up in a word, the Reforma-tion against popery was begun, and carried on through-out the whole of Europe,Šwhat was the power that en-tered into the lives of Luther and his co workers, and which enabled them to accomplish so much? What was the spirit that guided them in their arduous task? Promptly the Catholic will say, the devil; but, in the past at least, Protestants said, God. Yes, nothing less than the Spirit of God was the rul-ing influence in that mighty work. And, thank God, there are still ProtestantsŁ who dare stand upon the same foundation and say the same thing now; and by God's grace they will continue to say it until the day that Christ comes and puts an end to "that wicked" by the bright-ness of his coming. Mightily was the "sword of the Spirit"Šthe Word of GodŠwielded through Luther. By the straight testi-mony of God's Word was Catholicism confounded. Vainly with impotent rage, did the champions of the Catholic faith, from the pope down to the priest and friar, try to stop the work. Vain effort ! for the inspired testimony is that "the Word of God is not bound." Rec-ognizing no other authority than the Word of God, Prot-estantism for the time being triumphed. Inasmuch as it was by the Word of God that Luther prevailed, as any one can see in studying the history of the Reformation, the conclusion is inevitable that the Holy SpiritŠas already statedŠwas the real leader in  that work, the Catholic Church to the contrary notwith-standing. Through the power of the Spirit, Luther with a holy boldness denounced the papacy as antichrist. Was the Catholic Church this or not? If it was not, then the Spirit of God was arrayed against the Church of God. And "every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city divided against itself shall not stand." Thus said the Saviour on one occasion. Those words were true then; they are true now; they were true in Luther's time. But it is impossible that the kingdom of God can be divided against itself; it is impossible that the Holy Spirit can be arrayed against himself. If the work, of which Luther was the human instru-ment, was the work of the Holy Spirit, then that against which it labored was verily antichrist. If the papacy was not antichrist, then beyond the shadow of a doubt the Spirit of the Reformation was not the Holy Spirit. If, however, it was the Holy Spirit, and it was, then so long as the papacy shall exist, so long must the peo-ple of God keep on protesting; there can be no compro-mise. Antichrist then must be and is antichrist now. That party therefore which acknowledges the papacy as "our beautiful mother" not only acknowledges itself to be an own daughter of the papacy, but in the very na-ture of things acknowledges itself to be antichrist also. As the Holy Spirit led the people of God to protest against the papacy in the sixteenth century, so will he lead his people to protest against it now. While we say this we do not say, we do not even think it, that those who are avowedly papists are worse than other people. We really believe that in heart naturally they are as good as other people. But the papacy is the representativeŠthe embodimentŠof a principle which is against the government of God, and is destructive of good government on earth. It was this that led God's people in the sixteenth century to protest against it then; it is this which will lead the people of God to pro-test against it now. And when others who call themselves Protestants, ally themselves to the papacy, whether intentionally or otherwise, it becomes necessary to protest against them. In other words, when that which makes the papacy is embraced by Protestants, then the very likeness of the papacy is produced; and it becomes the bounden duty of God's people to protest against t he image of the papacy, as well as against the papacy itself. ON the 29th of the present month, a ballot will be taken throughout Canada to determine the will of the people on the question of prohibiting the traffic in intox-icating drinks. The vote will have no political signifi-cance so far as political parties are concerned. The text of the ballots is this: "Are you in favor of the passing of an act prohibiting the importation, manufacture, or sale of spirits, wine, ale, beer, cider, and all other alcoholic liquors for use as beverages?"
