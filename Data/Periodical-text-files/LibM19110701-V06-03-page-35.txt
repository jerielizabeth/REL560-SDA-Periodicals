LIBERTY 33 Church and State in Sweden S. F. SVEN SON GUSTAVUS VASA, the first Lutheran king of Sweden, was the founder of the state church of that country. Both he and his energetic son, Charles, cherished a strong tendency to rule the church; but they were opposed by such powerful Reformers as Olaus Petri and Olaus Martini, who partly succeeded in neutral-izing their effort to put the church wholly in subjection to the state. Though the church continued to be connected with the state from the time  ligious persecution has not been so se-vere in Sweden as in many other Prot-estant countries, yet there has been more than enough of it even here.
