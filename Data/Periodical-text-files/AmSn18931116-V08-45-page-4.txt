           VOL. 8, No. 45.               entitled, " Dangerous Antagonisms," in the issue of Oct. 19; and, "Stirring up Reli-gious Strife," in the issue of Oct. 26; and the article above, which was in the hands of the compositor before the receipt of the letters referred to. Of course every one realizes that what I have said is in arraignment of the asso-ciation impersonally,Šsome of the noblest characters, humanly speaking, that the world ever saw have been, through mis-taken judgment, to which all humanity is subject, champions of error, or, what is just as bad, champions of righteous causes after erroneous methods; and it is quite certain that there are many such among the ranks of the American Protective Asso-ciation, as also it is that there are in the number of those whom they antagonize. This is a contest of principles, not men; one is always sure then of a foe deserv-ing of his steel. Good men often igno-rantly range themselves on the side of bad principles; but bad principles are never found on the side of truth, right and goodness. Several of those, whose letters I have before me, are gentlemen for whom I have the highest personal regard, and whose feelings I would on no account wound. In deference to their expression of feeling, as far as I am myself concerned, I am perfectly willing to withhold all further statement, or formation of opinion, in reference to the-  American Protective Association until such time as its fruits show its character unmistakably to all. If, when that time comes, it should prove that I have been in error, in what I have said, no one will be more glad, and no one will hasten more quickly to say so, than I. W. H.

Hence, before this close association between religion and the State is even begun, a choice of reli-gion must be made by this corporate indi-vidual. But just here we are met by a distinct constitutional prohibition, which so long as observed must leave the State out of the question of religion; for it de-nies to it the power to make any selection or establish any kind of religion. The mistake which pious people are making in reference to this serious ques-tion, is in the supposition that unless the State has some kind of religion the people of the State are necessarily irreligious. But the reverse of this has always been true. The more religion the State has had, the less the people have had; and only where the question of religion has been left entirely with the people individ-ually, has the virtue, force, and moral power of it been manifested with compar-ative fullness. The reason is clear : State religion is necessarily a religion of majorities or ty-rannical minorities. In such religion nei-ther the element of justice nor freedom predominates, and hence the opposite, with all their corrupting and debasing influences must prevail. The very thing which is indispensable to the efficacy of religionŠfreedom of choiceŠis wanting in a State religion, and can only be present in full force where the State has no reli-gion and cannot have.ŠThe Independent Patriot. go and do precisely the very thing Jesus told him not to do. Jesus had said that it would have been better for the man who should do that wicked act had he never been born. The trouble with Judas was, he thought he knew something to be true, different from what Jesus was talk-ing about. He thought that Jesus would work a miracle and deliver himself, even though he should betray him into the hands of the chief priests, whom he knew were thirsting for Jesus' blood. He wanted that money, and felt confident that Jesus would take care of himself and come out unharmed. But when it was too late, he learned with bitterness that Jesus knew what he was talking about, and that he meant just what he said. He found himself in the cunningly laid snare of the devil from which he could not extricate himself ;Šyes, and all for thirty pieces of silver. How he now loathed that money Another point with Judas : by his dis-regarding the faithful warning of Jesus he went headlong into something , of which he himself could not see the out-come. After he had fallen into the snare Jesus himself could not rescue him. He had passed the bounds of His mercy and must be left to the destruction he had 'presumptuously chosen. It is a fearful situation to pass the boundary of God's forbearance and mercy. Judas had all the privileges of the other disciples. He had listened to the gracious words that fell from the lips of Jesus, but during this time when mercy and forgiveness lingered for him, his soul was so filled with self and covetousness that all the precious teaching of salvation availed him nothing. It is also said. of Judas that when he had received the sop (and Jesus plainly told them all beforehand that the man who consented to receive it would betray him) Satan entered into him. It is not at all likely that Judas realized this fact, but a fact it was. He was then under the full control of the power of evil; yes, and at the same time working for,Šhaving hired himself to,Ša fallen church power. Judas hired himself to the church, but was led by Satan. This is significant of that power which controls fallen churches..  All this, was written for our learning. We, who constitute this Republic, have had great light from heaven. For this light and favor God holds us accountable. Mercy has lingered for us, as a Nation, but when, in the face of solemn warnings, based upon God's word, sound reason and the history of other nations, we repudiate, governmentally, the principles of true religious freedom, we, at that moment, pass our probation, and ruin and desola-tion will, from that time, await us. That step has now been taken. Countenance has been given to religious laws, which mean persecution; and that act sanc-tions all religious persecution from the foundation of the world. Like Judas, those who have done this have stepped presumptuously upon ground from which heaven cannot save them, neither can they extricate themselves. The counsel of God's Spirit has been spurned (and it is only by the warning counsel and power of the Holy Spirit God can work upon human hearts). That Spirit was present in the Senate chamber, warning and entreating the representative men of the Nation not to meddle with religious dogmas when those measures were being clamored for by the chief priests of to-day. They themselves know      Can God Love and Protect This Republic? Tms Nation has been a favored one. God was manifestly in its founding; his powerful hand marvelously restrained those elements of persecution and injustice which threatened the Republic when the persecuted of other shores, who had found refuge here, themselves turned to be per- secutors. True religious, liberty, after severe contests with the demon of intoler-ance, was for the most part established. Had the same earnest and devoted energy exercised by our forefathers been perse-veringly continued by the succeeding generation the Republic would now be far in advance of her present attainments. During all these years and amid all the changing scenes of the Nation, so long as the principles of true libertyŠwhich are the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ Šwere not repudiated, God could and has blessed and prospered the Republic. But that time is now past. The SENTINEL has been telling faithfully of this evil work, stating clearly how it would be done, be-fore it was done, and since it has come to pass, its voice continues to proclaim when and how the wickedness was committed. The evil is done, although the men who did it knew not what they were doing (simply because they would not believe the truth when brought to them), yet it matters not now whether they knew it or not; for the results are the same. They might have known, therefore they are blameworthy and stand condemned, al-though they themselves may be supreme judges and law makers of the Nation. Judas knew not what he was doing when he betrayed the. Saviour, yet he was told all about it beforehand, as plainly as words could express it, by his loving Re-deemer. It seems now very strange that in face of all that Jesus told him he should  Religion and State Again. THE Chicago Presbyterian says: " We believe, as did the fathers of the Republic, in the separation of the Church and State; but we do not believe, as they did not be-lieve, in the alienation of religion and the State." Just what may be meant by this is not a little difficult to determine, either from the words quoted, or the entire arti-cle. It seems, however, that while the Presbyterian would not foist upon the State any Church organization, or require the State to support any sectarian formu-las; it would have the State and religion as closely allied as possible. But what reli-gion would it have thus allied ? Is there any which the Presbyterian can allude to in this remark, distinct from organization ? Is not this statement simply a covert ar-gument in favor of the union in fact of Church and State ? The Presbyterian is no doubt interested in the friendship of religion and the State, because of the supposed good which will accrue to one or both on account of their close association. This being the case, it is of course interested in the kind of reli-gion which the State shall be closely asso-ciated with. This interest will lead it to use its influence to secure for the State's acceptance the kind of religion in which it believes the greatest good is to be found. All other persons holding similar views of religion, and State, will also possess and actively manifest a like interest. But all will not agree as to what true religion is, and hence will widely differ as to what religion should be accepted by the State. It should be remembered that the State as such can accept but one religion. It can no more accept, encourage, and be
