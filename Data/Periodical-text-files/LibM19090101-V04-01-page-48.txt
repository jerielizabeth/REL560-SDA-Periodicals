Life and Health A Practical and Popular Monthly Journal of Health 64 Pages With Cover in Colors PUBLISHED with a view of assisting the public in the application of the hygienic principles of health ; teaching how to preserve the health ; prescribing simple hygienic remedies that aid nature in resisting disease by throwing off accumulated disease-poisons rather than adding more poisons through the use of drugs ; suggesting how disease may be avoided ; how to manage in case of sickness, and how to combat disease through the application of simple natural principles. The February Number comes nearer meeting the ideal of a monthly health journal than any previous issue. Some of the leading articles are : A Faith That Works Against Disease ; Cancer, Its Cause and Rational Treatment ; Preventive Treatment of Sore Throat; When Baby Has the Croup; The Treatment of Tuberculosis ; Children's Gardens, Their Value for Health, Happiness, and Physical Development; Cooking Les-sons; and Health Catechism. Several of these articles contain simple, practical instruction that may mean the saving of life. The March Number gives further consideration to the subject of cancer; able articles on self-poisoning; simple treatments for common diseases and emer-gencies; the attitude of physicians toward the temperance crusade. Other topics receiving consideration are: The Care of the Teeth ; The Influence of Moderate Drinking; The Effect of Light Alcoholic Liquors on German Schoolchildren; and the Difficulty of Early Rec-ognition of Tuberculosis.
