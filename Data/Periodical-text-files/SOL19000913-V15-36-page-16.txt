576 THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. CHICAGO, SEPTEMBER 13, 1900. Any one receiving The Sentinel of Liberty without having ordered it, may know that it is sent by some friend. Those who have not ordered The Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. " THE abolition of all Sunday work " is one of the demands of a new political partyŠthe " Social Pro-gress League "Šthat has been organized in New York. "A CONSTITUTIONAL monarchy is probably the most desirable plan that we could now adopt," says the Des Moines (Ia.) Globe. "Everything," it adds, " is ripe for the change." Some other statements that belong with this will be found on p. 572. AND thinkest thou that those five thousand, upon whom the hurricane and the sea fell, and slew them, were sinners above all them that dwell on the earth? I tell you, Nay ; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. A PAMPHLET purporting to set forth the "Reli-gious Life of President McKinley," published by three Methodist clergymen, is being circulated through the country, seemingly as a sort of cam-paign document. The Catholic Mirror well observes that " the dragging of religion into politics in this manner can have no effect except to cheapen the dignity of the former." akt IN justification of the movement for a federation of Catholic societies in America, our Catholic friends say that their rights are not safeguarded by the state, citing as an illustration that " the Catho-lics are obliged to bear the double expense of main-taining the parochial schools which their children attend, and the public schools, from which they de-rive no benefit." This of course is no more than any denomination might say which maintains de-nominational schools. No individualŠCatholic or ProtestantŠhas any reason to object to the payment  of taxes for the support of the civil government,,,, even though some of its institutions may be of no. direct benefit to him. And in the blessings which, the public school system confers upon society, the Catholic parent is indirectly benefitted, although his. own children may all be sent to the parochial school. DESCRIBING another race riot that took place last week in New York City, the Sun says that not a dozen men in the mob of a thousand persons who were hunting negroes " knew what the trouble was about, nor why they wanted to assault negroes; but fight is in the air," and only the activity of the police prevented probable murder. " Fight is in the air "Šthat is the right phrase for the situation; and the reason that " fight is in the air " is that we are being drawn into the climax of the age-long contest between the principles of right and :of wrong, of justice and of despotism. And with the climax comes the end. .at WE owe an apology to the city of TorOnto, Ont., for having recently published the statement that street cars were not allowed to run there on Sun-days. This was true of Toronto until within recent times, but about two years ago the city threw off the yoke of allegiance to a system which prohibited Sunday travel by public conveyance, and since then its citizens have been as well favored as any people elsewhere in this respect. Probably there are few, if any, large cities, also, where the prohibition of Sunday travel would be attended with less discom-fort to the people than in Toronto. EXAMINE THE LABEL.
