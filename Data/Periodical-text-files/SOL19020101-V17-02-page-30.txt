A DAY FOR- RELIGIO1J5 THE.  LORD'S D THE IVIC BASIS RGU MEN Â¥ +1,04.444, The Sunday-enforcement Teeter There is a strong and growing demand in these times for the enforcement of Sunday observance by civil law. Such enforcement is of course the enforcement of a religious observance and institution. American public sentiment, while it does not always come up to the standard of true American principle in this respect, is not ready to give its endorsement to the bald enforcement of religion by law. Hence there has been developed in behalf of Sunday legislation what may be called the "civic basis" argument, which essays to justify such legislation upon civil grounds, and thus secure for it the support of public opinion. The practical effect of this argument is shown in the above illustration. The character of the legislation and its effect remain the same; the religious institution and observance is still supported and enforced by law; the only difference is that there is substituted for such legislation a "civil" instead of a religious basis. The history of religious persecutions shows that with very few exceptions they were all conducted upon a "civic basis."
