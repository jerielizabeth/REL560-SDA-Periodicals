Address PACIFIC HEALTH JOURNAL, St. Helena, California.,  Ł What is  Religious Liberty? THE importance of a correct understanding I of this question, and the principles govern-ing the true relation and attitude of the church and state can not beoverestimated. Jefferson says, " The spirit of these times may, alter, will alter," and it must be apparent to all that religious legislation is rapidly gain-ing 'favor in the public mind;  and is embed-ding itself in the fundamental law of the land in defiance pf the Constitution and all Ameri-can Institutions. The Religious Liberty Library Nos. 1 to 26 will answer the many. questions arising in your mind on the subject of church and state. They are substantially bound in cloth, in three volumes; price for the set, $1.25, postpaid. Address THE REVIEW AND HERALD PUBLISHING CO., Battle Creek, Mich.
