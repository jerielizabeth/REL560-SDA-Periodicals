334 THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. HYGIENIC HELPS For the Housewife.. The books described below were prepared to assist those who wish to live in harmony with scientific health reform principles. They were written by practical housewives, and every recipe has been carefully tested. A FRIEND IN THE KITCHEN. We have no apology to offer in bringing to the attention of our readers a cook book discarding an article of diet which is every-where known to contain disease-producing germs, often of a most virulent type. While "A Friend in the Kitchen" contains no flesh food recipes, it does contain an abundance of that which is most palatable and whole-some, and it also tells how the foods may be prepared in the best possible way. Its 400 recipes are interspersed with short talks on foods and food combinations and other items of practical value and importance to every housewife, as well as to those who wish to study the sub-ject of diet for their own benefit. Remember it contains about 400 carefully tested recipes. The binding is a new preparation resembling leather, is almost as durable, and may be washed the same as oil cloth. PRICE, 60 cents postpaid.
