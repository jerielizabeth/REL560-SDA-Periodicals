MAN' g4, 1894. A.MVIZICAAN' 16 to Congress on the subject of a total sepa-ration of Church and state, and the taxa-tion of church property. This message would have been more appropriate for a governor's message addressed to the legis-lature of a State, for Congress has nothing to do with the question in the exercise of its taxing power. The whole spirit of the Constitution leaves this question to be determined by the respective States. But the President's sentiments were truly American. He said :Š In 1850, I believe, the church property of the United States which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to $87,000,000. In 1860 the amount had doubled. In 1870 it was $354,483,587. In 1900, without a check, it is safe to say, this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of gov-ernment, without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes, In a growing country, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The contempla-tion Of so vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may load to sequestration without constitu-tional authority, and through bloodshed. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally. President Garfield said :Š The divorce between Church and State ought to be so absolute that no church property anywhere, in any State, or in the nation, should be exempt from equal taxation ; for if you exempt the property of any church organization, to that extent you impose a tax upon the whole community. The census of 1890 has reported the alleged value of church edifices, the lots on which they stand, and their furnish-ings, as $680, 687,106. The following table shows in detail these values where the aggregate exceeds $4,000,000:Š All Methodists  All Roman Catholics  All Presbyterians  All Baptists  All Episcopalians  $182,132,304 118,342,366 94,869,097 83, 834, 272 82, 774, 018 Congregationalists  43,335,437 All Lutherans  35,060,354 All Reformed  18, 744, 242 Disciples of Christ  12,206,038 Ł Unitarians  10,335,100 All Jewish congregations  9,754,275 Universalists  8,060,333 All United Brethren  4,937,983 Evangelical Association  4, 785, 680 German Evangelical Synod.... 4,614,490 All Friends 4,541,334 This table does not include the value of parsonages, lots, monasteries, convents, schools. colleges, and the like; nor are these figures accurate, for a conservative estimate of the Roman Catholic " church property " alone is $250,000,000, and of the property of all sects, in this country, $2,000,000,000. Under the head of " church property" millions of dollars' worth of revenue-producing property evades taxa-tion, such as large lots of valuable land upon which there are no buildings, and which are held for revenue, and thousands of mercantile buildings, schools, and even factories. Practically, the effect of ex-emption has been to encourage the church in buying vast tracts Łof land, which are daily growing in value. Dr. H. L. Way-land cites this instance:Š I am credibly told that on a recent occasion a bishop went to the owner of a valuable tract in a neighboring county, and said, " What is the price of such and such a piece of land ?" "Sixty thousand dollars." " You have raised the price fifteen thousand dollars ?" " Yes." " Very good ; here is a check." It was bought for the church simply as an investment. The Protestant opposition to the taxa-tion of church property comes almost wholly from the Episcopalian and Luth-eran churches, which are more or less  related to State-supported churches in Europe. Yet there are many advocates of this taxation even among the Lutherans and Episcopalians. But the Roman Cath-olic Church is unanimously opposed to any taxation of its churches, schools, or other property. There are many reasons why its property should especially be taxed. The property of the Roman Catholic Church should be taxed because it is held, not by the people, but by the individual ecclesiastics, and is therefore personal property exclusively under personal con-trol. The anathemas of the Council of Trent are pronounced against all, even the clergy, who will not resist even the State itself, should the State attempt to give laymen, or anybody but priests and bish-ops, the control of church property. The sixteenth canon of the Council of Balti-more, held in 1852, shows how far a power emanating from Rome exercises influence over church property in this land. In-stances could be cited where the curse of excommunication was pronounced against all Roman Catholics who would not give the bishop control of certain property, and the persons resisting the clerical usurpa-tion were assaulted and driven- by force upon the Sabbath from the very threshold of the church which they helped to build as a house for their own worship. The churches are held in the name of the bish-ops, and not in the name of the trustees. It is said that Archbishop Corrigan, of New York, holds more than $50,000,000 worth of real estate in his own name. There have been numerous transfers of property from trustees to M. A. Corrigan: not to M. A. Corrigan, archbishop, nor to M. A. Corrigan, as trustee for the Roman Catholic Church, but simply to M. A. Corrigan. Many of these parcels cover whole squares of land, and nearly all of them are of great value. The pope's nun-cio, Bedini, came to America in 1855 to wrest the church property of Roman Catholics from the hands of the trustees and to place it in the hands of the bishops. It was because the title was vested in the bishop that the trustees of Roman Cath-olic churches in 1855 prayed the New York State legislature for redress, and the State answered that those who build the churches with their own money can govern the church temporalities as they please, and to-day the one-man power of the arch-bishop prevails over the sovereign law of the State of New York. Because the Roman Catholic bishops are the owners in fee simple of nearly all the church prop-erty within their respective ecclesiastical jurisdictions, and have the legal right to control, possess, and use it by assignment, by will, or otherwise, therefore their prop-erty should be taxed as personal property, or at least be deeded back to the wor-shipers. Calvary Cemetery, though nominally under the name or title of the Trustees of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, is in reality Archbishop Corrigan's own property. It is unlawful and against the discipline of the archbishop to bury any-where but in the archbishop's cemetery. Like a true monopolist he commands his own price and terms for lots, graves, tombstone fees, etc., for his own benefit; and I have been told by those who ought to know that the sums received have been at times as much as $2,000 a day. It seems to me that the archbishop ought to pay a tax on the receipts. The legitimate result of exemption has been the bestowment of public money upon  the Roman Catholic Church and its insti-tutions. The money donated by the City of New York to the Roman Catholic Church (to say nothing of the five and a half blocks of land in the best parts of the city, now worth $5,000,000), from 1869 to 1883 inclusive, was $8,555,250.39; from 1884 to 1893 inclusive, $5,526,733.34. Protestant denominations received during the ten years 1884 to 1893 inclusive, $365,-467.34. The New York State legislature for the year 1890 appropriated to sixteen institutions under Roman Catholic control $1,079,986.07; to all other denominational institutions, numbering twenty-eight, $946, 649.67. The amount of public money granted from the United States Treasury for the Roman Catholic Indian Missions, compared with the niggardly amounts given to other denominations, deserves notice :Š Total in 9 years.

It is earnestly hoped that all Protestant denom-inations will decline to receive further appropriations from the United States, so that they can consistently protest against the excessive grants to Roman Catholic schools. As an American I am opposed to this whole business, as recognizing the principle of a union of Church and State. Let each church support its own schools and charities, with its own money and not the money of others. The principle is wrong, for Protestant and Romanist alike, the latter sinning only more shamelessly than the former. Wherever you look, Roman Catholic church property is rapidly multiplying; and where the Protestant churches get lots, the Roman Catholics get blocks,Šentire squares,Šand hold them against all comers. Taxation or confiscation is inev-itable. Indeed, from the earliest days of the Church, every chapter in its history teaches the lesson of the danger of its policy as a great property-holder with special priv-ileges. The church derived her right to hold property from the civil power. Constan-tine the Great, great only in his sins, re-ceived his title of Great because he pro-vided by a civil law, still held sacred, that temporal power of the see of Rome, which made Dante sing : " 0 Constantine, how much evil originated, not from thy con-version, but from that grant from thee to the first pope whom thou madest rich." And in less than fifty years from that time the priests of Italy had gained one-third of the soil of that country.' In 1857 one-third of the real estate in Mexico belonged to the church, besides more than $300,000,-000 of other property in that poor coun-try, and its revenues were greater than those of the Mexican Government. When the property of the church was placed
