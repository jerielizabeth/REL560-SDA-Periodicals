"This unique position laid upon her two Herculean tasksŠTHE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT OF THE SUBJECT PEOPLES, and their defense against the barbarian races which swarmed around them on all sidesŠtasks UNDER WHICH THE OLD REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION BROKE DOWN." And at last, though "Rome had grown more selfishly exclusive in proportion as the value set upon Roman citizenship increased," SHE HAD TO ADMIT A LARGE NUM-BER OF THESE PEOPLE AS CITIZENS IN SPITE OF HERSELF. The more domineering the attitude of the Romans, the greater and deeper became the discontent of the Italians and the louder their demand for "complete amalgama-tion with Rome, which they had at first resented as a dishonor." "The justice of their claims could hardly be denied, the danger of continuing to ignore them was obviousŠyet the difficulties in the way of granting them were formidable in the extreme." Although "the temper of senate and people alike was still jealously exclusive," one popular leader after another in Roman politics "held out promises of relief" until at last there was accomplished a "sudden and enormous enlarge-ment of the citizen body" at the very time when the Republic was least able to carry the burden which its own course had rendered more difficult by far than it would have been at the beginning. From the first the decay of individual integrity prepared the way for what it brought in the end. In practise the government tended more and more to "become an oligarchy." "The senate, not the assembly, ruled Rome, and both the senate and the magistracies were in the hands of a class." "Office brought wealth and prestige, and both wealth and prestige were liberally employed in securing for this select circle 'a monopoly of political power." The senate and magistracies became "the mouthpieces of this order [the aristocracy of wealth], and identified with it in interest." "The senate became more and more an organ of the nobility [of Ł wealth], and the nobility became every year more exclusive, more selfish, and less capable." Thus, though "the right of the people to govern was still valid," "ALL THE REAL POWERS OF GOVERNMENT WERE HELD BY THE ARIS-TOCRACY OF WEALTH." "The highest offices of state were open in theory to the meanest citizen; they were confined in fact to those who had the longest purses, or the most ready use of the tongue on popular platforms." "THE ELEC TIONS WERE MANAGED BY CLUBS AND COTERIES; and, except on oc-casions of national danger or political excitement, THOSE WHO SPENT MOST FREELY WERE MOST CERTAIN OF SUCCESS." "MONEY WAS THE ONE THOUGHT from the highest senator to the poorest wretch who sold his vote in the comitia." "The elections, once pure, became matters of annual bar-gain and sale between the candidates and the voters." "Under these conditions THE CHIEF POWERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH NECESSARILY CENTERED IN THE RICH." And "while Rome had been extending her sway westward and eastward, while the treasury had been enriched, and while her nobles and merchants were amass-ing colossal fortunes abroad, the small freeholders throughout the greater part of Italy were sinking deeper into ruin under the pressure of accumulated diffi-culties. . . . The heavy burden of military service pressed ruinously upon them, and in addition they were called upon TO COMPETE WITH THE FOREIGN CORN IMPORTED FROM BEYOND THE SEA, AND WITH THE FOR-EIGN SLAVE LABOR PURCHASED BY THE CAPITAL OF WEALTHIER MEN. Farming became unprofitable, and the hard, laborious life with its scanty returns was thrown into still darker relief when compared with the stirring life of the camps with its opportunities of booty, or with the cheap provisions, fre-
