548 AMERICAN SENTINEL. expressed in the word, "Trust in God, and keep your pow-der dry." Now the cause that needs the powder of human manufacture is not of God to begin with. If it is neces-sary for God to protect his people, he will not, use either sword or rifle. The angel of God was sent to stand between Jerusalem and the invading army. When the morning came it revealed 185,000 Assyrian warriors dead on the field where there had been no baitle. Hu-man beings often lose the protection that Jehovah would give, because, like Peter, they bring in their rusty sword, or their Mauser rifle. "Peacemakers" for the Philippines. THE president of the official commission from the United States to the Philippines has returned. In pub-lished interviews be has made some statements that are of much interest to all who would study and trace the course of national affairfi. In the interview published in the Chicago Times-Herald, it is said that "he seemed to regard the Tagalos, the real rebels, rather as brave and promising children who had been led astray by bad counsels and who would be all the better when their castigation at the hands of the United States soldiery had put them in a position to appreciate the real mean-ing of the coming American rule." That he more than "seemed" to regard them as children is plain from the fact that he plainly said in the interview as published: "It will not do to consider the natives in the same way you would fully civilized peo-ples. They are to be regarded more as children. The great difference between such half-civilized peoples and the fully-civilized races is that the former lack an ade-quate sensepf fact. They are easily led astray." And so the United States must become altogether a paternal government, for the sake of these misguided children on the other side of the earth, and by libera, "castigation at the hands of the United States soldiery',  give them "an adequate sense of fact," and so put them in a position to apprediate the real meaning of American rule. Then how long will it be before this same patern-alism will be exercised at home to convey to people here "an adequate sense of fact" and teach these too how to appreciate the real meaning of American rule. Indeed we do not need to ask how long; for the thing has already begun and is steadily going on. And it is American rule, do not forget. Now and henceforth it must be borne in mind that the President of the United States is a ruler: not a presiding officer, to learn and execute the will of the people; but a ruler, a pater patrm, to decide what is best for the children of the State, and deal it out accordingly. However, it is on the subject of the Filipinos and the Catholic Church that Commissioner Schurman makes statements that reveal a new and interesting feature of the American-Philippines matter. One of these statements is that "the armies on both sides are very apt to use the church buildings as head-quarters or barracks, because the churches are the most strongly built structures." Now since only last year the United States Government paid to the Methodist Church South $484,000 for the occupancy of only one building that belonged to that church during the war of Secession, is it likely that the Catholic Church will fail to use the precedent? Will she not most surely present her claim for dainages in the case of every church building and every piece of church property that has been in any way occupied or used by the United States in the Filipino war? And since the Methodist Episcopal Church South obtained $484,000 for the occupancy of only one piece of church property, how much will the Catholic Church probably get for the 'occu-pancy of all the pieces of church property touched in the Filipino war? Another statement is, "I think it would' be one of the best things that could happen if many Catholic priests would go to Luzon, as they would undoubtedly have a great influence for good, and I have written some of my Roman Catholic friends, telling them how strongly I feel about it." He says that the Filipinos all insist that thby are "devout Roman Catholics," however much they may be opposed to the religious orders and Spanish priests in the islands. The Times-Herald explains and approves president Schurman's plans in the following words:Å  " Professor Schurman's discussion of the church question in the Philippines is of great importance in its bearing on the general situation. It presents a delicate and intricate problem which must be carefully studied if it is to be solved satisfactorily. "In order to understand it we must go back of the origin of the Tagalo insurrection against Spain. This will be found in the ill-treatment of the natives by the friars. Four religious orders had acquired possession of immense tracts of country, and their members abused their powers in various ways. They finally exercised a tyranny in which there was confiscation, corruption of the courts and desecration of the home. "When we succeeded to Spain's title to the island by treaty we assumed the obligation to maintain property rights as they were. But the Tagalo had determined upon reprisals. He proposed to despoil the friars. When, therefore, his leaders told him that the United States would not consent to this the conclusion was accepted that the Americans were prepared to become the champions of the old abuses. "The question is complicated by the fact that not-withstanding his hatred of the religious orders, the Tagalo is a devout Catholic. His complaint is not against the church as a whole, but against the offending orders only. Hence it will be necessary to persuade him that we are neither the friends of the friars nor the ene-mies of Catholicism. In the opinion of Professor Schur-man our best advocates would be American Catholic priests. "The professor cites the experience of Father Mc-
