SMITH, 0. P. 1301,1.1\4A.1"4,1 Editors Human jurisdiction extends only to outward acts, and to these only so far as they affect the rights of others. at A religious opinion is not any more entitled to the protection of law than is an opinion touching secular affairs. .At Every person's conscience is for himself alone, and if every person would be sufficiently conscientious for himself he would not try to become conscience for other people. ot "The general welfare" cannot be promoted by ig-noring individual welfare. "The masses" cannot be reached by any good which goes over the head of the individual. Religious liberty is not license to trample upon the rights of our fellowmen. It is, however, freedom from interference in all matters of religious faith ; and in all practice touching religion, not inconsistent with the equal rights of others. ..og Opinions do not outweigh rights.

This is an important question, worthy of the most careful and candid consideration. PHYSICAL REST NECESSARY. Of course physical rest is one of the necessities of human beings. Nor can it be denied that under certain conditions a regularly recurring weekly day of rest is most helpful to man. Rest seems to have been one of the objects the Creator had in view in giving the Sab-bath, if not in the beginning before the fall, at least when He called His chosen people out of Egypt. See Deut. 5 :14.≈Å SPIRITUAL REST PRIMARY. But while the Sabbath gives physical rest, and was so designed, its primary significance is, and was de-
