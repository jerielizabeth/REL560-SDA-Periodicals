Thompson (Hamilton, Ontario) ALREADY the campaign of " ' on to Ottawa' for legislation in defense of our Canadian and Christian Sabbath," announced in their manifesto of a few weeks ago, is being gotten under way by the Canadian Sunday-enforcement lead-ers. Realizing that the Provincial Sun-day laws have been swept away by the recent decision of the Privy Council, the " Lord's Day " Alliance people are " on to Ottawa " for human statutes to defend the Sunday sabbath. To be sure the Bible is silent not only as to the manner of the observance of the day, but as to any ob-servance of it at all, and more than this Sunday observers themselves are not agreed as to the manner of its observance. But nevertheless the Alliance wants, and is setting about to obtain, laws not only requiring the day to be observed, but pre-scribing the manner of its observance, by and for all the citizens of the Dominion. The annual meeting of the executive committee of the " Lord's Day " Alliance of Canada was held at Ottawa on August 13, and in connection with it the first im- portant steps in the " on to Ottawa " Sun-day-law campaign were taken. At the meeting " there was a large representation from all over Canada, including Messrs. R. L. Borden, John Charlton, Senator McMullen, and many other prominent men." A committee composed of the fol-lowing persons " was appointed to draft the proposed Lord's Day act " : Rev. Dr. Potts, Principal Caven, Dr. Car-man, E. M. MacDonnell, K.C., J. A. Paterson, K.C., A. E. O'Meara, Alex. Mills, R. U. Mc-Pherson, Mayor Urquhart, of Toronto ; D. Grant, VancoUver ; J. A. Aikens, Winnipeg; J. S. Buchanan, Montreal; D. Stockton, St. John; B. H. Eaton, Halifax; and J. T. Mellish, Charlottetown. For the purpose no doubt of aiding in the passage of the act which this commit-tee is to draft " it was decided to hold the Alliance's first triennial convention at Ot-tawa during the next session of Parlia-ment." But the most important step, and one which served to show that the move-ment now under way and the measure which it aims to secure will have the sympathy and support of the " govern-
