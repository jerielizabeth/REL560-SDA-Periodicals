94 AMERICAN SENTIN EL power of God to enable men to do right by planting the righteousneSs of God in the heart thrOugh faith in Jesus Christ. Rom. 1:16, 17. We never once dreamed that it was in the power of civil law to remove the cross and make the straight and narrow wary to heaven easy. " Must I be carried to the skies On flowery beds of ease, Whilst others fought to win the prize And sailed through bloody seas?" Indeed, we can according 'to the above, just come and join the Christian Citizenship movement and improve our civil laws, and thus make it easy to do right by legislat-ing away the cross. Then we will not need to be "cruci-fied unto the world;" We won't need to "suffer with Christ that we may reign with him." We shall need no longer to "watch and pray lest we enter into tempta-tion," for temptations will be removed by 'improving civil law, and making it" easy to do right.

How any man with an open Bible in his hand and the history of the past before him can put forth such reasoning is a mystery that .we are not able to solve. But such is the blindness of men when they "walk in the sparks of their own kindling." Were it not that the prophets have described and warned us against just such a state of things in the last days, we could hardly make ourselVes believe that men could descend into such dense darkness. Did we not read, from the sacred page that there would be a union Of religion and the State which would bring about the last great struggle between the powers of light and darkness, we could hardly believe our own ears as, we listen to such sentiments as are put forth by these would-be reformers. "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come." Lbndon, Ont., Feb. 2. THE National Reform party has now abandoned hope with reference to its so-called Christian Amendment to the Constitution, so far as concerns this session of Con-gress. After being so thoroughly disposed of before the,  hearing given 'by a committee of Congress last year, it was left in the hands of the committee without further action, and to a request recently preferred by its advo-cates for another hearing, reply was sent that no further discussion of the matter could be allowed.
