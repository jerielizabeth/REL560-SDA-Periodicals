THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 287 after this incident McCarthy reported to Chief of Police Houghton that Mace was keeping his place open on Sunday, and this led to the complaint and summons against Mace. Religious laws have always made an acceptable weapon for the malicious and the hypocritical against their neighbors. This will be found to be no less true now than in preceding generations. THE Cottage Pulpit, of Nashville, Tenn., publishes this outspoken expression of noble and worthy feeling in reference to the fines and imprisonment suffered by Christian citizens of Tennessee under the State Sunday laws :Š In regard to the persecution of Seventh-day Ad-ventists in Henry County, and elsewhere in this State, we have this further suggestion to offer : That if the intelligent Christians belonging to the communities where these men have been arrested would step forward and refund fines that an ignorant or prejudiced justice of the peace or judge has imposed upon them, under mistaken zeal for the maintenance of the State's laws, they would honor Christ and his cause by it, and relieve themselves and the church in Tennessee of the appear-ance of complicity and approval of such disgraceful proceedings. Or, perhaps better still, to show the world that America's boasted heritage of religious liberty is not all a sham and a fraud and a mockery here at the core of the Nation,Šhere in the old " Volunteer State," as her citizens so proudly call her, because of her read-iness to defend the national honor when the frontier was invaded, why not, you Christian men of honesty and intellect, exert your influence upon the governor of the State and have him remit the fines, as we pre-sume he has the power to do, and thus cleanse the hands of our good commonwealth of the uncleanness, and her fair name of the stigma, of being thought a reviver of the old inquisitorial fires of persecution under color of law. THIS account of an interview between a Presby-terian clergyman of Stillwater, Minn., and Arch-bishop Ireland on the public school question is from the New York Herald:Š The Archbishop charged the public schools with being godless, and professed a desire to introduce religious elements into them. I suggested that when I went to school we recited the Lord's prayer and read from the Scriptures, and asked how they were driven out. He confessed that it was largely owing to Catholic protests. I again suggested that committees of all religious denominations meet and formulate a ritual to be used as a text book, containing religious instruc-tions that would not be objectionable to any sect and that no persons of good morals could object to. He objected on the ground that I would not con-fess to the Catholic idea, admitting that what Cath-olics wanted was the teaching of the Catholic re-ligion in the schools. He cited an instance in which the State legislated in a matter of religion, requiring the observance of the Sabbath, and re-marked that the State didn't do that for the sake of religion, but to require the observance of Sun-day as a day of rest. He then said : " Why not legislate immediately in that way in the matter of the public schools ? ' Claiming that by such a plan the State would im-mediately arrange religion, I objected to the Sab-bath as not being a parallel, the Sabbath being com-mon to both Catholics and Protestants, but that the Catholic religion which he was advancing in his plans was not common to both Catholics and Ł Protestants. The Archbishop frankly admitted that the Prot-estant's conscience had good reason to be offended when Sisters of Charity were introduced into the Central Public School buildings and placed over Protestant children. I asked if I might infer from that that the garb of the Sisters of Charity had a teaching force. This he practically admitted. The Archbishop is an astute and plausible talker; but, as I said to him, his plan involves the impos-sible condition of putting religious instruction by the State in schools, which is contrary to the laws and conditions of the State. I suggested that this plan was one that could stand only on its merits, and in the eye of the law this religious element robbed it of all merit. He seemed confident that some compromise would be arrived at by which the difficulties would be met. I gained from him the information that his efforts are by no means considered at an end. It will be noticed that in antagonizing the Ro-man Catholic prelate it was necessary for this Presbyterian to acknowledge the impiopriety and impossibility of the State teaching religion in the public schools, although this position directly crossed the suggestion which he had previously made as to the formulating of "a ritual to be used as a text book, containing religious instructions that would not be objectionable to any sect." a JUST ISSUED I CONTAINING  60 New Hymns, . 50 New Songs, 40 Old Favorites,  10 National Songs.
