AN EIGHT-PAGE WEEKLY JOURNAL, Devoted to the defense of American institut.ons, the preservation of the United States Con- stitution as it is, so far as regards re- ligion or religious tests, and the maintenance of CIVIL and RELIGIOUS Rights. The SENTINEL will ever be uncompromisingly op-posed to anything tending toward a union of Church and State, either in name or in fact. It is well known that there is a large and influential association in the United States bearing the name of the "National Re-form Association," which is endeavoring to secure such a Religious Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will "place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." While there are many persons in this country who are opposed to, or look with suspicion upon, this movement, there are few, outside of the party, who realize what the influence of this amendment would be. The object of the AMERICAN SENTINEL Will be to Vindicate the Rights of American Citizens, which we believe, are threatened by this association. It will appeal to the very fundamental principles of our Government, and point out the consequences which would be sure to follow should they secure the desired Amendment to the Constitution. Every position taken will be care-fully guarded and fortified by sound argument. Due respect will always be paid to the opinions of others, but the rights of conscience will be fearlessly main-tained. TERMS.
