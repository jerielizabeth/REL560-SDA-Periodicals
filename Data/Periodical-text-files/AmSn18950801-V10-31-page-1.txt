SMITH, - ASSISTANT EDITOR. IN THE CHAIN-GANG UNDER THE Fug. IT was the evening of the third of July, that the eight Seventh-day" Adventists, now in the chain-gang in Rhea County, Tenn., went to prison. Court had adjourned until the following Monday, and the judge, before whom they had been tried, the attorney-general, who prose-cuted them, and the jurors, who found them guilty, had all gone home to spend the FourthŠwith their friends. But not so with the convicted Adventists. Their wives and children, a number of whom had been in court to hear the judge's sentence, had bidden them a sor-rowful good-by, and had gone to their now lonely homes. Most of their friends who had been with them through the trial had also gone home and left themŠpris-oners. It was then the sheriff said, " Come on," beckoning them to fall into line for the marsh to the jail, which was to be their prison until the temporary workhouse should be ready for the occupancy ofŠthe chain-gang. A few moments sufficed to reach the prison, and then came the registration of their names with a detailed description of each man, so that should they escape they might be easily identified. But the eight Adventists had no thought of escape. They would not resist wrong and oppression even to the extent of seeking freedom in flight. As the sheriff registered their names, some, earnest of the patriotic demonstrations of the morrowŠ" the glorious Fourth "Šattracted their attention and reminded them that it was  the eve of the National Independence Day; and one of them said, with a smile and yet sadly, and with just a touch of irony in his tone: " Sheriff, won't you please erect a lib-erty pole to-morrow where we can see it ?" Oh, what a train of thought is started by that question! What! a liberty pole and a flag for convicts? What could " Old Glory," the " Star Spangled Banner," the emblem of Freedom, the flag of both the State and the Nation, mean to men who had violated the "law" of the land, who had braved the power which wears the flag? What comfort could chain-gang convicts, " law" breakers, possibly derive from looking upon the banner unfurled by the power that enslaves themŠthat power that brands them as enemies of the State, and drives them to the stone pile with the vilest criminals, that locks them in loathsome cells or works them ten hours per day under a broiling sun, for no other offense than wor-shiping God according to the dictates of their  own consciences? In short, What is the flag of the Union to Seventh-day Adventists to-day ? Ah! thrilling memories cluster around that flag; for while Seventh-day Adventists have no taste for war or carnage, while they as fol-lowers of the Prince of Peace are opposed to war, even as are the Quakers, they remember that it was in the providence of God that this land became an asylum for the oppressed of other lands; and they love the old flag because under its folds their forefathers found that liberty to worship, which was denied them in the Old World, and which is to-day denied Adventists in "free Amer-ica;" not because of the flag nor of that for which it stands, but in flagrant violation of the prin-ciples represented by every fiber of that noble banner; principles for which patriots died in 1776, and for which in this year of our Lord, 1895, men toil in the chain-gang in Tennessee. And in the language of the poet these men can to-day look upon that flag and sayŠ " Thou art Freedom's child, Old Glory, Born of Freedom's high desire." * The flag had its birth in the days of Washington, and Jefferson, and Madison, and Patrick Henry; in the days when men knew the value of liberty because they had known what it was to be denied freedom of conscience; in the days when humble Quakers, pa-tient Mennonists, noble Baptists, warm - hearted Methodists an d staunch Presbyterians a 1 ik e claimed as an inalienable and God-given right, freedom to worship their Creator according to the dictates of conscience, and challenged the right of any man to dictate to them in matters of religion, or in any manner to come between them and their God. Those stars and stripes stand for the immor-tal Declaration of Independence and for that noble charter of liberty, the Constitution of *From "Old Glory," by James G. Clark, in Arena for May EDITORS. " KNAVES have stolen thee, Old Glory, for their Babylonian bowers; From their festal walls and towers droops the flag that once was ours; O'er their crimes thy beauty trails, and the old-time answer fails When from chain-gangs, courts and jails men appeal to thee, Old Glory."
