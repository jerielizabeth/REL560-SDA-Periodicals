THE "SUCCESS" NASAL SYRINGE Of the thousand and one remedies that have been used in 0* treatment of that very common and horrible dise.se, nasal catarrh and other nasal affections, none have been wholly suc-cessful. The main reason is that the remedy has not reached the diseased parts. The douche and atomizer have been used to force the medicine through, hit or missŠgenerally missŠand thus the rough honeycomb-like, burrowed tissues were allowed to re-tain the irritating, poisonous matter, while the disease pro-gressed from bad to worse. The physician was abused and the'  edicine declared worthless. By the use of the "Success" Syringe the medicine is applied without danger or irritation, directly to the disease. Every little cavity, nook and corner can be reached and all foul matter washed away and the disease speedily cured. The tube being soft and pliable there can be no danger as from hard instrumeits.
