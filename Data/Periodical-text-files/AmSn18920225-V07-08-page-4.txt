Badly Mixed. REV. JUSTIN D. FULTON, D. D., author of "A Fight with Rome," " Why Priests Should Wed," "Washington in the Lap of Rome," and numerous other works of like nature, is perhaps regarded by the public, as one of the most firm and fearless ene-mies to the aggressive and ambitious de-signs of Rome in this country. As one listens to, or reads his burning words, he can but be convinced of his earnestness, and perhaps of his sincerity; but the ques-tion may often arise in one's mind, What is all this fuss about ? What is the Doctor fighting so fiercely ? Is it Romanism or is it Romanists? Romanism is, and al-ways has been, and by its very nature, must always remain, the enemy of civil and religious liberty; and hence of intel-lectual and spiritual development. Ro-manists are the poor unfortunate children of this, false, paternal system. To fight Romanism for the, purpose of liberating the Romanist, is a noble work; but to fight the Romanist is to attack those who' are already spiritually and in-tellectually down, and who, therefore, are the very ones who most need our sympa-thetic help. It must never be forgotten that Zwingle in Switzerland, Calvin in Geneva, Henry VIII. in England, and Knox in Scotland, all made the great mis-take of espousing the very principles of Romanism with which to fight the Ro-manist; and thus, in their respective lands, they ruined or retarded the real Reformation. Romanism is a union of Church and StateŠa spiritual despotism. All the black record of the Papacy, is simply the logical, and unavoidable re-sult of that union. To fight Romanism successfully, the Romanist must be taught this fact, by precept and example. The United States is the only nation that has ever, even in theory, totally separated Church and State. The people of the United States are the only people who, as a people, have ever professed to depend upon the power. of God only in the fight with the Papacy, and with all iniquity. It follows that the true Christian Ameri-can stands on a, vantage ground in this conflict with the prince of darkness. He needs only to be strong in his faith to-ward God, and ever true to the principles of American liberty. He must not be-come a Romanist to fight Rome, for this is to fail. Dr. Fulton has seemed to realize these facts at times, but in his attempt to carry them out , he has become badly mixed. From pages 219 and 220 of " Washington in the Lap of Rome," I quote the follow-ing THE STATE HAS NO RIGHT TO RECOGNIZE THE CHURCH. If the Court of Special Sessions can corn-mit to a Roman Catholic institution, children be-tween seven and fourteen years of age, as idle, truant, and vicious or homeless, then the State can put its neck into the yoke Rome has been framing for many years. . . . The law says NO CONNEC-TION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. The free exer-cise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed in this State for all man-kind. The Constitution of the United States, in providing for religious liberty, expressly declares -that no restraint should be exercised, that Congress should make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; but recognizing the principle introduced to the no-tice of mankind by Roger Williams, who repudi-ated toleration, because the right to tolerate implied the right to persecute; and who would not accept as a favor from man what had been given him as a right by God. This is Americanism not, Romanism. It is not only Americanism, but it is good religion, and good politics. But strange as it may seem, on the next two pages of this same book, and written by the same pen, I find the following :Š Put the Bible back where it belongs. Let it be-come a text-book for the children of America. . . . The Bible ought to be made a text-book in every in-stitution helped by the State, because of what the Bible does for the State. If the Romanists do not like it let them dislike it. Speaking of the idle, and vicious, and homeless, he says, " They are children of the State. Give them religious instruc-tions by giving them access to the word of God." In all this, of course, as the context plainly shows, the Doctor means the Prot-estant Bible, to be read by Protestant teachers to all, Catholic and Protestant alike, in the State schools. He means also, Protestant " religious instruction " to be given by Protestants to all, es-pecially to the children of Catholics, in the State schools. And yet, it was only two pages back that the Doctor informed us with much enthusiasm and apparent sincerity, putting his words in large cap-itals, that, " the State has no right to recognize the Church," and again, that all worship shall ever be free, and " with-out discrimination or preference." This same Doctor is now arguing his preference for the Protestant religion, and the Prot-estant Bible, and that these, instead of being left " free " for the choice of every one, shall be forcibly taught in the State schools, and every tax-paying Catholic shall thus be forced to support what he does not believe, and worse yet, shall have his children taught it. Verily, Dr. Fulton's ideas of liberty, and of prefer-ence, and of freedom from all discrimina-tion, must be badly mixed. And the ar-gument in support of all this is the old pagan idea that religion is a benefit to the State. True, religion, supported only by the power of God, and taught only by the warm willing-hearted of his people, is a benefit to the State. But any religion that has to be taught compulsorily by the State, and that depends for its support  upon taxes extorted from those who do not believe it, is a curse to the State and the people. Again Dr. Fulton says on page 227 :Š Resist this devil of Romanism and it will flee. Put the Bible back where it belongs. . . . See to it that the children of the State are given reli-gious instruction, so that they shall know the chief doctrines of the Bible. Let there be no sectarianism taught and no antagonism engendered. One can but smile to see this positive contradiction in almost the same sentence. Every one knows that there is not one of the "chief doctrines of the Bible," that is not a basis of sectarian division, and that different sects understand them dif-ferently. The Bible itself is a basis of sectarian division between Catholics and Protestants, and between all Christians and the Jews and agnostics. Viewed in the light of past history, the idea of teach-ing these doctrines to all, and compelling all alike to support their teaching in the State schools, and doing all this without engendering any antagonism, is supremely ridiculous and absurd. The very attempt to do such a thing, would, as in the fourth century, engender such an antagonism of sect with sect, that council after council would be demanded to 'settle the contro-versy; and these councils could only re-sult, as then, in compromise after com-promise between the contending factions, till if anything could precipitate a reli-gious war upon this Nation, that would. The fact is that all this advocated' by Dr. Fulton is Romanism. It is precisely the same principle that evolved all the, marvelous mechanism of the Romish hie-rarchy, and so cursed the world for cen-turies. After this it will not seem surprising that in the same book on page 49, Dr. Fulton quotes the Blair Joint Resolution to amend the Constitution of the United States, and indorses its principles. Every reader of THE SENTINEL knows that that resolution is, in principle, Romanism; and that, if passed, it would build a new Pa-pacy out of the Protestant churches of the United States, even if there was not a pa-pist in the Nation, in precisely the same way that the Papacy was built out of the Christianity of the fourth century. Now, however, as the Papacy is a far greater political power in this land, than any other professedly religious organization, for a Protestant to advocate the putting of religion into the control of the State, as Mr. Blair and Dr. Fulton certainly do, is simply to advise Protestantism to strengthen the hands of the Papacy. When the teaching of the Christian(?) re-ligion is made compulsory in the State schools, the State will then claim and ex-ercise the right to decide what is the Chris-tian religion. What will then be called Christianity, will not be a matter for the discussion of each individual conscience, guided in' its search after truth by the Spirit of God; but it will be a matter for the dictation of the strongest political power
