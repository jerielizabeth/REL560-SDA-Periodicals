"IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT."ŠJesus Christ.   VOLUME 14. NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 7, 1899. NUMBER 35.         Published in the interests of Religious LibertyŠChris-tian and Constitutional. AWAny one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to INV fOrit. (Entered at the New York Postoffice.) No STATE, or government, ever yet became religious without doing harm both to religion and to the rights of the people. No state can profess one religion without being against some other religion. ot THE serpent of falsehood will always choose para-dise as the place from which to do his speaking, when he can get intoŁ it. We cannot accept unguardedly any statement, no matter with how much truth and good-ness it is associated, without running grave risk of deception. .4 .4 THE antediluvians remained unconcerned on the eve of the deluge, taking no steps to save themselves from the coming catastrophe; and their mistake has been repeated by men in every age since that time. It is being repeated by many to-day. It is being made by you, if you are engrossed with pleasure-seeking and, the service of self. That pathway always ends in an un-pleasant surprise. .4 .4 THERE are many places in this countryŠone at least in every StateŠwhere a model community exists, so far as it is in the power of law to produce such a commu-nity; places where the inhabitants never get drunk, never steal, never commit murder; where the great ma-jority go to church, and all observe Sunday. Those places are the State penitentiaries. And when people advocate a scheme of reforming society by law, as so many are now doing, it devolves upon them to show  what power there is in law to maintain society on a higher moral level than prevails in the penitentiaries. .4  .4  THE object of law is to protect men in the enjoy-ment of their rights. It protects men from one another; it guards each one against encroachment by the others. But it can protect no man against himselfŠagainst evil in his own heart. It cannot keep him from doing wrong. And therefore human law cannot undertake to prohibit wrong doing, as such. It prohibits the wrong-doing when, and only when, that would invade another's rights. All men have the opportunity to do wrongŠthey must have it in order to develop character. And they are to be judged, and condemned or justified, not now, but at the end of the world; not here, but at the bar of God, and by the law of God. Any human law, therefore, which prohibits a thing merely because it is wrong, or is deemed so, is contrary to the purpose of God, and can work only evil as long as it exists. - 14 The Deceptive Spirit of Politics. SINCE writing what was printed last week under this heading, an incident has occurred which strikingly illustrates the commingling of religion and politics which has brought the religious world under the spell of a great deception. In the press reports the incident is thus described:Š " OCEAN GROVE, Aug. 27.ŠA most extraordinary scene, the climax of the great camp-meetings of the past week, took place to-day when a great crowd was aroused to heights of religious and political enthusiasm. "The latter was the result of the visit of President McKinley, which called forth a remarkable address by Dr. A. E. Schell, of New York, corresponding secretary of the Epworth League. He said:Š " 'The church militant salutes the nation militant, and recognizes that their mission and duty is to day
