The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, MARCH 26, 1903 NO. 13 The American people have not gone to Canossa, but something certainly has happened that can scarcely be said to have ever happened before. . . . The transactions must increase the size of Rome in American affairs. ŠSpringfield Republican, July, 1902. Against such legislation [the Sunday-closing legislation now pending in the Illinois legislature!, all fair-minded men should protest. The State should not be used as a club by those in one branch of business to injure those in another equally lawful. If it is innocent to sell milk and bread six days in the week, it is no less so on the seventh. ŠThe Law Rfgister, Chicago, March 4. I believe that all strictly church properly ought to be taxed. . . . I would have all strictly charitable insti-tutions free. But I do not know why a Jew should be taxed to help support the Church of the Messiah; I do not know 'why I should be taxed to support the Cathedral; I do not know why the Catholics should be taxed to support the Brick Church. Let the people who beliebe, believe enough  and care for their religious belief enough  to pay for it, or else go without it. That seems to me to be the fundamental principle of justice and right in the whole matter. ŠDr. Minot J. Sabage, New York, March 8.
