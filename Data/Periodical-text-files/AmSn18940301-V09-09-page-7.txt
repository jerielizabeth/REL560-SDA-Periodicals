That the penalty for violating any provision of this act shall be a fine of not less than ten dollars for the firs offense; for second or subsequent offenses, a fine not exceeding fifty dollars, and imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than thirty days, and one year's forfeiture of license, if any is held by the offender or his employer. SEc. 3. That this act shall take effect upon its passage. It will be seen that this bill throws a sop to Seventh-day Adventists in the shape of an exemption clause. But the so-called exemption will be spurned by every consistent Sabbath-keeper. Con-gress has no right to pass such a bill either with or without an exemption. The principle is wrong and no amount of exemption can make it right. So long as the right to touch religious questions is asserted by the law-making power the evil remains no matter how attenuated it may be. Adventists will oppose the whole thing. A CATHOLIC paper says that, with the approval of the pope, the general of the Jesuits has written to the emperor of Ger-many expressing thanks for the progress of the bill for restoring his order to favor in the empire. Father Martin promises that the society will be very good, and devote its energies to Catholic education, and to the training of missionaries who shall carry the gospel (of the Jesuits, of course) to the colonies of the empire. The remarkable feature of the case is that this is just what Bismarck expelled them for. -Exchange. THE Catholic Standard, Archbishop Ryan's organ, says :- Many of our non-Catholic newspapers aro accus-tomed to speak of certain members of the hierarchy and other distinguished ecclesiastics and laymen as belonging to the party of " Liberal " Catholics. Such a party, we are happy to say, has no existence in the Catholic Church. This is but molding in other phrase the familiar motto, " Rome never changes." It should serve as a warning to those who imagine that not only individual Catholics but that Rome herself is becoming liberal. THE destruction of every empire has been preceded, after a period of careless luxury, by a comatose condition of the mind which has closed the eyes to external warnings.--Sir Samuel Baker. Waterman's Ideal Fountain Pen "I find the most satisfactory pen of its kind," says Chauncey M. Depew, President of the New York Central R.R., and thousands of others are ready to bear a similar testimony. This pen is simple and yet highly philosophi-cal in its construction. It rarely gets out of order and seldom needs repairs. The pen-points are fine, medium or coarse, and of all grades of flexibility from soft to very stiff. Any hand can be suited. A full guarantee goes with each and every pen. The cut shows a No. 4 pen (gentleman's size) reduced about one half in size.
