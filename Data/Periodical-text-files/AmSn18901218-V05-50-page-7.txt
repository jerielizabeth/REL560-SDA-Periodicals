SIBERIA AND THE NIHILISTS WHY KENNAN WENT TO SIBERIA, By William Jackson Armstrong, (Late Inspector General of United States Consulates.) This is one of the most intensely interesting and thoroughly reliable con-tributions to literature on Russia and the Nihilists ever published. It comprises Mr. Armstrong's famous lecture on "Siberia and the Nihilists" (delivered first in Cooper Union, New York, and afterwards by special request of many eminent men in Lincoln Hall, Washington), together with some exceedingly interesting letters and newspaper criticisms from the pens of the author and George Kennan, the Siberian traveller. EVERYBODY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK,  because no one can be intelligent upon the subject of which it treats without familiarity with its contents. Besides, the book is a powerful stimulus to that love of liberty so essential to the maintenance of free Government. It contains some pointed and caustic criticisms upon Mr. Kennan's defense of the Russian Government after his first visit to that country, and explains WHY KENNAN VV,ENT TO SIBERIA  the second time. The Century articles which were the result of that visit fully justify the position taken, and the statements made by Mr. Armstrong in 1883. 160 PAGES, PAPER Coypus, PRICE 25 cents.

THE NATIONAL SUNDAY LAW THIS PAMPHLET CONTAINS THE ARGUMENTS IN BEHALF OF THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS, AND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BLAIR SUNDAY- REST BILL, WHICH MR. JONES PRESENTED BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR, DECEMBER 13, 1888. Mr. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING."  And Mr. Jones' comments make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially Legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is based on Scripture and history, constitution and law, showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-Law Movement of the Fourth Century, AND THE Sunday-Law Movement of the Nineteenth Century.

A., Rector Christ Church, Los Angeles. Cal. The above is the title of a treatise written by the author at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a dis-cussion upon the present aspect and aims of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as the Papacy, or Vaticanism, is outlined in the prophecies of Holy Scriptures with sufficient accuracy to determine what the " Papacy " is, and what is to be its future devel-opment and ultimate end.
