This volume is a concise and val-uable collection of historical data relative to Sunday, collected from many books. The author has spent much time in getting these together in handy form for reference. When was Sunday observance instituted? What brought it about ? Is there Bible authority for it ? These and many more equally im-portant and interesting questions are answered in this book. 232 pages, paper covers, 5o cts., postpaid. - PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO. 11 West 20th Street New York City 790  THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY  Sellemeil THE now.
