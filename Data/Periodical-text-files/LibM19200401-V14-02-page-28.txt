R. Bell IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 1111111 T  HERE are two institutions in the world that are ordained of God. Each has its own Heaven-appointed work. Their work is along parallel lines, but neither conflicts if the divine plan is carried out. These two insti-tutions are the state and the church. Civil government, the state, is ordained of God, and its laws pertain solely to man's rela-tion with man in temporal affairs. The church is ordained of God, set in the world under God for the saving of the lost; and all its laws per-tain only to that relationship which men sus-tain between themselves and God. Civil government is set in the providence of God to keep men civil in their relations the one with the other, and pertains only to men. Reli-gion, the church, is set in the providence of God to deal only with sin, saving men from it. Re-ligion is an experience of the heart. It is a personal relation between man and his Creator. All of religion's customs and' usages belong to the realm of conscience, a realm with which the civil government can never rightfully deal. The only work of the church is to persuade men to be reconciled to God. The gospel which the church is to minister to men has no other legitimate power than the power of love. In no sense whatever is the church to enter the realm of the state. By Him who ordained both civil government and the church, the law has been handed down for the guidance of each, which reads: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's." Luke 20: 25. Should the church and the state hew to the line in their Heaven-appointed spheres of ac-tion, each performing its own work separate and distinct the one from the other, then liberty with its full measure would be enjoyed by all. Force belongs to the state, and carries with it " bonds and imprisonment." Persuasion, backed by a love unfathomable belongs to the church. An opinion handed down by the supreme court of Ohio reads: " True Christianity asks no aid from the sword of civil authority. It began without the sword, and wherever it has taken the sword, it has perished by the sword. To depend on civil authority for its enforce-ment, is to acknowledge its own weakness, which it can never afford to do. It is able to fight its own battles. Its weapons are moral and spiritual. and not carnal. Trio' Christianity  never shields itself behind majorities. . . . A form of religion that cannot live under equal and impartial laws ought to die, and sooner or later must die." Take the matter of Sunday laws. Sunday is an institution of the church. It is a religious institution. Take religion out of Sunday, and there would be nothing to it. Take religion out of a Sunday law, and there would be no Sunday law. A Sunday law is an acknowledgment of the weakness of the Sunday institution. It is a confession that Sunday "cannot live under equal and impartial laws." When the church seeks the power of the state, as it does in every Sunday ordinance, it is a sign of decay, the hanging out of the flag of distress. The United States Senate report de-clares: " Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion for enforcing re-ligious observances." A Sunday law uses fines and imprisonments. A Sunday law means that the church has left the Heaven-appointed path. The proper peti-tion for Christians begins, " Our Father who art in heaven," and not, " The Honorable City Council " or, " The Honorable State Legisla-ture." We can rest assured that when the voice of the church is heard in the city council cham-ber, or the State legislature, or the national Congress, asking for laws to sustain its prac-tices, and to enforce them upon others, it is silent in the court of heaven. Again, a Sunday law makes a matter a crime if it is done on Sunday, that is recognized as lawful and right on the other six days of the week. It makes a man who is recognized and looked up to as a good law-abiding citizen through six days of the week a criminal because he does on Sunday just exactly as he has been doing all through the other six days, and in the doing of which he was looked up to and re-spected. If what a man does on Sunday is wrong, then the same thing is wrong on any other day of the week. If it is not wrong to do certain things on the other six days of the week, what is it that makes it wrong to do those same things on Sunday? Why does the church get up a petition and seek the power of the state to stop men doing things on Sundays The church deals with sin. Is it sinful to operate a store, or perform honest toil during six days of the week/ If not, is it a sin to
