Temperance Two Kinds of Bars C. M. SNOW THERE are two kinds of bars con-nected with the saloon business Š the kind over which men pass their money and receive in exchange the poisoning of body and soul, the filching of their rea-son, the disgrace, sorrow, and poverty of themselves and their families ; and the  for the families of the poor, in the place of scaffolds on which to hang the head of the household when drink has made him the murderer of his own flesh and blood ; we can prepare the children of the poor to do honest battle with adversity, in-stead of sending them to sweat-shops to grow up to manhood with a handicap of ignorance and a predilection for crime ; kind behind which men are shut away from the rest of humanity when drink has driven them to crime. He who passes his earnings over the one tempts the devil to put him behind the other. Abol-ish the first kind, and we can dispense with more than three fourths of the latter. We can do more than that Š we can stop a river of sorrow, and wipe out a sea of tears ; we can put peace and hap-piness in the place of turmoil, abuse, and wretched poverty; we can build parks for tenement children to play in, instead of prisons for their fathers and brothers to be shut away in ; we can build houses  we can write, " Vacant Š for Rent," over the gates of our poor-farms and almshouses, and stop a great portion of the turbid stream that is flowing into our asylums ; we can close two thirds of the brothels, put the procurer and pro-curess largely out of business, and feel that the dangers threatening our daugh-ters from that source are reduced in like ratio. We can do all that, and more, when we have closed that kind of bar over which money is exchanged for liquor, character for appetite, peace for misery, honor for disgrace, hope for de-spair, and the possibility of heaven for the certainty of hell.
