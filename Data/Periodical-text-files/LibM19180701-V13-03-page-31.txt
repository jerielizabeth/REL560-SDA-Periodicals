Editorial Brevities                   Let America Shun the Trap THE church, as such, should never meddle in political matters. Her mis-sion pertains to spiritual and not secular affairs. Her voice may rightfully be raised in protest against encroachments upon her divine privileges and rights, but she should never be heard soliciting secular aid to forward her divine inter-ests, nor should she exert her power to gain political influence with the state. The more popular and numerous the adherents of any religious sect, the more dangerous is their influence when their united force is exerted in politics. The state should never recognize the head bishop of one sect above another, no mat-ter how few or many its adherents may be. For the good of both the church and the state, they ought to remain abso-lutely separate, and operate without aid-ing or abetting each other in their dis-tinctive fields of spiritual and secular concerns. It is highly incongruous for any church organization to have diplo-matic relations established with the civil powers. Such relations have always been produ'etive of great evils, in both spirit-ual and secular realms, and they always will be productive of dire consequences. Let America shun the trap into which the European powers have fallen. Gon created the mind to be free. He has never conferred upon any one the right to imprison it. Human enactments which circumscribe conscience, subject the soul to a thraldom more humiliat-ing and more ruinous than any the body has ever endured. Where conscience is fettered, there is no freedom worthy of the name. It took many generations for men to learn that he who prescribes laws to hamper or to crush the consciences of men, makes a slave of himself and of his posterity. as well as of those against whom sueh laws are aimed. He only is AMONG all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of human history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated the law of God.Š Report of Senate Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, Jan. 19, 1829. A SEEKING sinner can always find a seeking Saviour. A man who truly loves God does not need to be compelled to worship him. There is nothing to hinder a man from observing the Sabbath if be wants to. If he does not want to, and he is compelled, then he has been changed, not into a Christian, but into a hypocrite. The gift of civil power of compulsion in religious concerns is the worst calamity that can befall any religion. LIBERTY is the state or condition of being exempt from the arbitrary control, or domination, of others. It is freedom from artificial restraint. Politically, it is the possession and exercise of self-government. Morally, it is the posses-sion of power to preserve at all times the approval of one's own conscience. Liberty being all this, it exists only in consonance with that which is right. There can be no real liberty in the vio- lation of right principles. C. P. B. IN every country and in every age the civil government which has recognized religion, true or false, has enforced it under pain of death, and has always been hostile to individual freedom in re-ligious matters. This country is in dan-ger of following the same course as did the Roman Empire. " It was the aim.  of Congtantine to make theology a branch of politics ; it was the hope of every bishop in the empire to make politics a brawl of theology. Already, however, it was apparent that the ecclesiastical
