The Supremacy of the Papacy By Alonzo T. Jones VIII THE PAPACY-THE VERY SAME PAPACY THAT THE WORLD KNEW IN THE TENTH CENTURY-IS TO-DAY AIMING TO SECURE TO HERSELF A RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SHE HAD THIS ONCE. THE ARTICLES THAT ARE APPEARING UNDER THE ABOVE HEADING ARE A STUDY OF HOW SHE USED IT. SINCE IT IS HER OWN BOAST THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES," TO KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH SUCH SUPREMACY WHEN SHE HAD IT IS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH IT WHEN SHE SECURES IT AGAIN. Three PopesŠ"Confusion Worse Confounded." BOTH colleges of cardinals now united against both popes. The two colleges of cardinals met in one, at Leghorn. There they agreed, and de-cided to set their authority above that of the popes ; and, on that authority, to call a general council to assemble at Pisa, March 25, 1409. Each company of car-dinals sent a summons to its respective pope, and circular letters throughout the realms of Europe that recognized the re-spective popes. Benedict's cardinals charged him with being " the author and maintainer of the schism," and as " wicked as the Jews and the heathen soldiers who would rend the seamless robe of Christ." They charged him with insincerity, artifice, obstinacy, and contempt of his oaths. Gregory's cardinals charged him with being " a man of blood, without honor, the slave of his carnal affections, a drunkard, a madman, a proclaimed heretic, a sub-verter of the Church of God, an accursed hypocrite." They charged him and Bene-dict XIII. with all the evils that accom-panied the schism. They declared that they had chosen Gregory XII. " as the best and most holy of their Order ; he had sworn deeply, repeatedly, solemnly, to ex-tinguish the schism by renunciation. He had afterward declared such renunciation diabolic and damnable ; as though he had taken the keys of St. Peter only to acquire the power of perjuring himself, and of  giving free license of perjury to others." The two popes, seeing that a general council was to be assembled, each himself called a general council! But the general council called by the cardinals became the real one. In the general council of Pisa thus called there were twenty-six cardi-nals, four patriarchs, twelve archbishops and eighty bishops in person, and four-teen archbishops and a hundred and twoŁ bishops by their representatives. There were eighty-seven abbots in person, and two hundred by representatives. The-generals of the four great Orders of the Church were present; delegates from thirteen of the great universities of all Europe were there Š Paris, Toulouse, Orleans, Angers, Montpellier, Bologna, Florence, Cracow, Vienna, Prague, Co-logne, Oxford, Cambridge Š and the chapters of a hundred metropolitan and collegiate churches. There were three hundred doctors of theology and of canon law. There were ambassadors of the kings of France, of England, of Portugal, Bohemia, Sicily, Poland, and Cyprus ; of the dukes of Burgundy, Brabant, Pome-rania; of the margrave of.  Brandenburg; and the landgrave of Thuringia, with many other German princes. After the formal opening of the council, proclamation was made at the doors of the cathedral. " demanding whether Peter de Luna or Angelo Corario were present, either by themselves, their cardinals, or
