Sunday=Law Oppression in Philadelphia Again PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR Th Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XIX WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 21, 1904 NO. 3 Ł Christian clergymen should "maintain the Christian Sab-bath " by Christian methods. " That obserl'ance of the Lord's day that is secured by force cannot be pleasing to Him in whose honor the day is set apart. The Committee of Fifty may compel men to abstain from selling candy and cigars on Sunday, but it cannot compel them to an exercise of the heart and will rivhich alone could make their abstinence service acceptable to God."Š See Page 41. " The persecution of obscure, insignificant, petty trades-men and lromen who eke out small livings by selling apples and tobacco on Sunday is not the work to which our relig- ious leaders are summoned. . . . For fifty Christian gen- tlemen to associate themselves for the purpose of devoting their holy zeal to this petty business is a wretched, miser-able, silly farce." Š See Page 41. The supreme court of Pennsytbania has declared that the purpose of the Sunday law of that State is "to enforce the obserl'ance of Sunday." This is the exact truth, and this has been the purpose of the enforcement of the Sunday law in Philadelphia during the past year. And nothing more than this is needed to establish the fact that that law is in 'Notation of the article of the constitution of Pennsyl-'bania which begins loith the declaration that "all men have a natural and indefeasable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience," and that its enforcement outrages the natural and constitutional rights of citizens.
