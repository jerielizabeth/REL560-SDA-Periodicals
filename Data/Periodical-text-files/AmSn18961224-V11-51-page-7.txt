(SECOND EDITION.) BY ROSALIND AMELIA YOUNG A Native Daughter. ** Pitcairn Island, one of the volcanic gems of the Pacific. has been heard of wherever the English language has been spoken. The story of the working out of the problem of human life on its limited territory reads stranger and more thrillingly in many respects than a romance. But most, if not all, or the tales told and books printed have either been too fragmentary or incorrect and misleading. It will be interesting to the frier n: of that miniature world to know that an authentic history) Lr been written, and that by a native of the island, ene to 11, manor born. Miss Rosa Young is one of the direct descendant,  of the mutineers of the Bounty. The book is a plain. um ar nished tale of Pitcairn and its inhabitants from its settler to the year 1894. It is written with a charming simplicit3 of style which refreshes the reader and invites a continual pet I -sal. Illustrated with 26 engravings by the half-tone procmr, and its 23 chapters have each a neatly engraved heading. Price, $1.00 With Sentinel, - 1.50 ADDRESS, AMERICAN SENTINEL, 39 BOND ST., NEW YORK.
