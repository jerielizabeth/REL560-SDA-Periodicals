THE MARVEL OF NATIONS This remarkable book contains a portrayal of American progress since the founding of the nation to the close of the nineteenth century, when this nation stood as one of the first nations of the world. The manner of its rise and its political nature are evidence of its prophetic importance. While the historical past and the prophetic present of this nation are of great interest to the American people, the principal and most interesting feature in this work is its teaching of the Scriptural future of the United States. As evidence of the public appreciation of this work, the 300,000 copies circu-lated will testify. The work contains 324 pages. Beautifully and substantially hound in two styles.
