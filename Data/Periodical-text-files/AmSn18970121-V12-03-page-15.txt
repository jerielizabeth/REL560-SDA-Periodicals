COON BROS., Battle Creek, Mich. Gentlemen: Wash day has been made easy by the use of the "Cyclone:" have given it a thorough trial. Did a large washing for myself, and assisted a neighbor besides; have washed two very heavy spreads, two quilts, a bed tick, and a few other heavy articles. We get the real worth on these heavy articles more than we can on the common macnine. I haven't got to be the last to put my washing out either. Yours truly, MRS. FLORENCE MAY.
