Waterman' * Ideal Fountain X® Pence Claims first attention, as it certainly is The Best Fountain Pen on the Market. Other makes may be good, but the WATERMAN IS THE BEST. Some points of excellence are:Š The fine quality of the gold pens; The reliability of its feed,'which has stood a ten years' test; The absence of any portion of the feed on the top of the pen point, whereby it is left untrammeled and acts with all the ease and grace of any first-class gold pen. Vi,ATERMANWIIIEPf Among those who use the Waterman Pen are REV. LYMAN ABBOTT, Editor "Christian Union," New York. CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW, Pres. N. Y. C. & II. R. R. Co. HON. W. E. GLADSTONE, Hawarden, England. JOHN WANAMAKER, Ex-Postmaster General. And thousands of others whose judgment may safely be trusted, all of whom with one consent pronounce the -Waterman "THE BEST FOUNTAIN 1-11-in\T." Among the many excellent features of this pen, to some of which we call attention, stands one of no mean value, and that is the shape of the holder. There is, in the new style, no prominent collar or shoulder to come in contact with the fingers when writing, but the holder has the pleasing touch of any ordinary good pen holder. The Waterman makes a most acceptable present to a parent, to a child, to a brother, to a sister, to a friend, to anybody, and will be SENT AT OUR RISK to any address in America on receipt of price. In ordering state what kind of a pen you like best. Whether stiff or flexible, fine or coarse, etc. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED. No. 12. Ladies' size. [Small] $2.50. No. 14. Gentlemen's size - - $4.00.
