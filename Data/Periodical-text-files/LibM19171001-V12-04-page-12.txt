G. DANIELLS ATHEOCRACY is a form of gov-ernment in which all the affairs of men, whether temporal or spir-itual, civil or religious, are united under the control of God. The government of Israel was a true theocracy. It was really a government of God. When doing their duty, the kings of Israel ruled the people according to the directions of God. But the kings did not always do their duty. Many of them —rejected the counsel of the Lord. This was carried to such an extent by Zede-kiah that God said to him: "Thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown : this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, over-turn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Eze. 21 : 25-27. In fulfilment of this sentence, the kingdom of Israel was subsequently overturned three times Š once by Medo-Persia, once by Grecia, and once by Rome. Soon after the third overturn-ing, the theocracy of Israel was removed from the earth, and, according to the sentence of God, "It shall be no more, until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it him." He " whose right it is," and to whom that kingdom will be restored, is the Lord Jesus Christ. Of him we read: " He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:- 4406 Ł Ł  and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1: 32, 33. When Christ was on earth, he declared to Pilate that his kingdom was not of this world. John 18 : 36. He further declared that the time when he would sit upon the throne of his kingdom would be at his coming. Matt. 25: 31, 32. " Therefore while this world stands, a true theocracy can never be in it again. From the death of Christ until now, every theory of an earthly theocracy has been a false theory. And from now on until the end of the world, every such theory will be a false theory. Yet such was the theory of the bishops of the fourth century." And it was this theory that led to the establishment of the Papacy. Augustine's Dangerous Theory . Augustine, one of the Fathers of the Catholic Church, reasoned thus: " It is indeed better that men should be brought to serve God by in-struction than by fear of punishment,
