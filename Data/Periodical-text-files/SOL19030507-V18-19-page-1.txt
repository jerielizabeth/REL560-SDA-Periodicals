PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, MAY 7, 1903 NO. 19 16. The growth of the Roman Church in the United Slates is one of the most striking facts ih history. What makes it all the more noteworthy is its unexpectedness. . . . That a new country, openly sworn to the principle of per-sonal liberty, should have proved to be the most favorable ground on earth for the growth of a church openly sworn to the principle of authority is surely a notable thing. It is probably true that during the nineteenth century the actual gain to the Roman Church in numbers, wealth, influence,  and prestige has been greater in the United States than in all the rest of the world together. And the gain is not only or chiefly in the particulars mentioned. She has gained the popular good-will, or at least a favorable prepossession, and she has conquered respect. . . . Whether or not Rome is gaining from or losing to Protestantism in the ag-gregate is a question to which it is very difficult to give a reply. . . . What can with certainty be said at present is that  THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY GENER-ALLY ARE MUCH BETTER DISPOSED THAN THEY WERE AT AN EARLIER DATE TO SUB-MIT TO A CHURCH WHICH DEMANDS OBEDI-ENCE. The self-assertive habit of personal independence in every relation of life has been greatly weakened, and promises to grow still feebler in our more highly organized life, where the individual continually counts for less and the organization for more.
