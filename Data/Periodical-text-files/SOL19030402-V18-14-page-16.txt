A TWE\ TY-FIVE CENT EDITION OF  POWER FOR WIDESSI\G- Heretofore the 75 cent edition of this remarkable volume on the work of the Holy Spirit has been the only one obtainable; but a new edition in paper covers is now ready, the price of which is 25 cents, postpaid. We believe the mere announcement of this fact will induce hundreds to secure a sufficient number of copies to supply their Sabbath-school classes and friends who are interested in the subject. It is so filled with incidents resulting from the operation of the Spirit on hearts that it will be eagerly read by all. AN ILLUSTRATED DESCRIPTION WILL BE SENT ON APPLICATION.
