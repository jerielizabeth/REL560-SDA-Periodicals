The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII THURSDAY, JANUARY I, 1903 NO. 1.1StIED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR            TO OUR PATRONS AND FRIENDS: With this issue the weekly publication of THE SENTINEL is resumed.  Although as a monthly THE SENTINEL has received general commendation, it has been the universal testimony of its friends that as a magazine it was by no means as well adapted for free circulation and distribution, and for re-mailing, as when it was published in the lighter and much cheaper (per copy) form in which it appeared as a weekly. The publishers have realized that this was a serious impediment to the fulfillment of the purpose for which THE SENTINEL is published, and therefore have decided to issue it again in a shape that is free from this objection. It was not deemed necessary to change from the magazine form, and since many have grown to like THE SENTINEL in this smaller shape, it has been decided to issue the weekly in the same form. The number of pages is reduced to one-fourth the number contained in the monthly, and this makes a periodical that is free from the "bulkiness" of which some have complained regarding the monthly, and which is of course much cheaper per copy. And there is another important reason that has led to this return to weekly publication. A great deal is taking place in these days in the special field to which THE SENTINEL is devoted, so much in fact that monthly pub-lication was too infrequent to meet the needs of the situation. It is not ex-pected that the weekly can do that adequately, but of course it will present a report four times as often as the monthly, and each time the matter will have a freshness that could not be the case with much that was presented in the monthly. This is a change that will no doubt be appreciated by all. We shall try to make THE SENTINEL an attractive and valuable publi-cation, and ask that all our patrons and friends will co-operate with us in giving it as wide a circulation as possible.
