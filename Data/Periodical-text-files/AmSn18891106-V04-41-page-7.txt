WE do not mean that a National Sunday Law is now ready, but that-a treatise underthis name, prepared by Alonzo T. Jones, is now ready for circulation. This pamphlet contains the arguments in behalf of the rights of American citizens, and in oppo-sition to the Blair Sunday-rest bill, which Mr. Jones presented before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, Dec. 13, 1888. Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING," And Mr. Jones's comments will make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accompanied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is Based. on Scripture and History, Constitution and Law, Showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-law movement of the fourth century, the Sunday-law movement of the nineteenth century, the methods used in securing  indorsements to the petition for the Blair bill, and the workings of such Sunday laws as are propose for the United States. The work contains one hundred and ninety-two pages. Price, 25 cents. Address, AMERICAN SENTINEL, 1059 Castro St.. Oakland, Cal.; 43 Bond St., New York. West Shore Railroad N. Y. C. & H. R. R. R. Co.
