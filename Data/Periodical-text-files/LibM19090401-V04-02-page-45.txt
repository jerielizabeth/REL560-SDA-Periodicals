T h e President w h o turns down his glass at a ban-quet where wine is  served strengthens many another of weaker will to do the same on that or some other occasion. It is with pleasure, therefore, that t h e friends of temperance have learned of the action of Em-peror William of Germany in re-gard to the use of alcoholic bev-erages. Induced, possibly, to take such action by the constant increase in the use of these beverages, the emperor appointed a commission a year or two ago to investigate the question of the con-sumption of liquors by the people of his realm. The returns of this commission opened the eyes of the emperor to a con-dition of things that was far from promising. He found that the people were taxing themselves for alcoholic beverages more than he was taxing them for the support and increase of his navy. They were drinking of beer, wines, and other alcoholic drinks the enormous total  of 2,020,674,300 gallons a year, or thirty-three and one-half gallons for every man, woman, and child in the whole German empire. The emperor doubtless reasoned that his example would be more telling than his words in combating the evil. There-fore it was that he made the de-cision, in Decem-ber last, to ab-stain henceforth from the use of intoxicating 1 i q - uors as a bever-age, and person-ally to use at s t at e banquets and receptions a temperance b e v-e r age, specially prepared for that purpose. There is probably no other 4  record in history of a crowned monarch taking such a position. During the proceedings of t h e Methodist Preachers' Meet-ing at New York on Dec. 21, 1908, resolutions were adopted con- gratulating the emperor upon the posi- tion he had taken, and assuring him of the prayers of the 974 ministers present and the 200,000 communicants whom they represented. An engrossed copy of these resolutions, a reduced facsimile of which appears on this page, was for- warded to the emperor through the American minister at Berlin. It is hoped that from the influence of this example much good may accrue to the cause of temperance not only in Germany, but throughout the world. t4.t  .fpf 61414  - 4,7i0 41fttiartiti4*elertL"la"?tatiflii-tiiiitirltirsfil-LrilholietLfir  i4iki4tfili.wiR Aiera60.i.77.eatta ' "  0.44,  fec44; ..44,(44VeAmAte,(4.-,6:  xo. -14,;34e: 4,45'.4,w.a,;orfr.a.,:JI4.1, 1114.!=c OF h.( NKr cop.pit.'4n litre; a  the Ittater4eyo "toe call the hviiihirktilt-  fig; f;eit htthertiFitt 137,74¥Ay'r.',44.060,144:PJ  apex/ ¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥" ¥
