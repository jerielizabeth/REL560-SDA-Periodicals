 MARCH 9, 1893.                indicted, and the attorney-general has doubtless pocketed, ere this, $2.50 for the service, but no arrest has yet been made upon this indictment. Other like cases there were, but the writer has not the names at hand. All the indictments upon which arrests had been made, but which did not corre- spond with the order directing the attor- ney-general to secure indictments, were quashed upon motion of the attorneys for the defense; the judge holding that he could not confer any such wholesale au-thority, as it was the evident intent of the statute, that the attorney-general should be appointed prosecutor ex-officio only in cer-tain well-defined cases. It seems probable that His Honor signed the order simply upon the request and representation of the attorney-general without so much as read-ing it, for while it is very possible that the attorney was ignorant of the law, it does not seem probable that Judge Swig-garb was not familiar with the practice of the courts of Tennessee in such cases. Such are, briefly, the facts in regard to these cases, as learned right on the ground by the writer. They simply afford addi-tional evidence that the prosecution of Adventists in Tennessee is religious perse-cution. It is related of the cruel Emperor Adrian that on one occasion when one of his governors wrote to him concerning certain charges against the Christians, he replied, saying, " If the people of the province will appear publicly, and make charges agains the Christians, so as to give them an opportunity of answering for them-selves, let them proceed in that manner only, and not by rude demands and mere clamors. If any thus accuse them," he continued, " and show that they have com-mitted any offense againt the laws, do you decide according to the nature of the offense. But, by Hercules !" exclaimed the impetuous emperor, " if the charge be a mere calumny, do you estimate the enormity of the offense, and punish the calumniator as he deserves." Such was the command of a heathen emperor, but such is not the law of a pro-fessedly Christian commonwealth. As we have seen, the law of Tennessee provides a secret inquisition before which secret charges may be made, the real accusers never being known, they appearing, if at all (and in these cases they have not ap-peared) simply as witnesses for the State. The charges are made in secret; the ac-cusers never confront the accused; but their own brethren in the church and members of their own families are re-quired to furnish the evidence upon which they are convicted. This is the manner in which the Adventists in Tennessee are prosecuted. None of their neighbors are willing to allow their names to be used as prosecutors; indeed nobody in the county is willing to appear in that capacity, ex-cept the attorney-general, and that for the reason that "the Adventists are good neighbors ; " nevertheless, residents of the county to the 'number of forty, so General Lewis says, petitioned him to prosecute the Adventists for Sunday work and com-pel them to stop it. Scores of white men 4n the county who are not Adventists, work on Sunday more regularly and more publicly than do the Adventists; but only the Adventists and a few negroes are prosecuted. As was remarked in these columns a week or two since, so far is the prosecution of these memo from proving that the prosecution of the Adventists is not persecution, that any one who is acquainted with the status of the average colored laborer in the South will understand the added igno-miny that it was expected to put upon the Adventists by condemning them to the chain-gang in the company of " niggers." A few people in the North may be de-ceived by this pretext, but it will only open the eyes of the people of the South to the enormity of the outrage which is being perpetrated upon an unoff ending and conscientious people, by the author-ities of Henry County, Tennessee. C. P. B. tions from organized labor from every State in the Union, except New York, asking that the Fair shall be located in Chicago." That Fair was located there. But even before it was located there, the demand was made by Congress that Chi- cago should show its ability to carry out the Fair by subscribing for ten millions of her stock. The workmen put their hands into their pockets, and with dimes and fifty-cent pieces and dollars sub-scribed for millions of her stock. What did the Church do ? Did the Church demand that there should be an exposition of the world's products and man's ingenuity ? If it did they did it silently. The workmen responded in this substantial way; and since then they have built the Fair and consecrated it with their blood. Hundreds and hundreds of workmen have been killed and maimed in the construction of that mighty work. And I think that because of these reasons what we have to say should have addi-tional weight attached to it. Not only that, but giving all due credit to the master minds who designed and planned that wonderful expositionŠgiv-ing them all due creditŠthe products ex-hibited there come from this kind of hands. (Here the speaker clapped his hands together.) And after we have built the Fair, sacrificed our lives in doing so, after we have contributed by our in-genuity and labor in placing there the exhibits, these men who had no hand in it, neither in designing, constructing, nor in' anything else connected with it, have come and shut the gate and turned the lock on us workmen, and then they come here with the miserable plea that they are instructed, that they are justified in speak-ing for labor. It is absolutely astound-ing, the assumption these men have in making their plea. I cannot comprehend how they could risk their reputation for veracity, for honesty, and for truthŠand that is all the stock in trade that the clergy have, and if that is lost they are goneŠhow they could risk their veracity and honesty in making these statements. One of them comes here this morning, and says, " I hold a petition from a labor Union in New York City." What labor Union ? Rev. Mr. W. F. Crafts here spoke up and said : " The engineers of the United States." MR. IVIoRGAN.ŠWho ? MR. CRAFTS.ŠThe Brotherhood of Lo-comotive Engineers. MR. MORGAN.ŠNo. Look here, that claim, that statement that is made that they duplicate things is basely, maliciously false. They do not duplicate thitgs. And then they bring in a single petition from one of the local Unions in the State of New York, and make people believe they have got another organization. MR. CRAFTS.ŠOh no. MR. MORGAN.ŠWell, of course my comprehensive faculties are not equal to grasp your way of managing these things. (Laughter.) Another statement is made that because the engineers of the United States speak, that settles the question ; that they are the most intelligent of ali workmen in the United States. I abso-lutely repudiate that statement, and I give my reasons therefor. There is hardly an occupation to which man is obligated that prohibits to the same extent, intellectual development, as the locomotive engineers' occupation does. And hence when you assert that in presenting their claim to a        Ł Ł  Ł                       A False Claim.   A PARAGRAPH from an article in the Chicago Herald, entitled, " False Claims Concerning Sunday," says :Š The claim that Sunday is the Sabbath under the fourth commandment of the Decalogue is false in point of fact. If that commandment continues to govern men, as a specific law, the seventh day and not the first is the Sabbath. That point was so clearly put dur-ing the discussion of Mr. Quay's motion in the Sen-ate that his language was amended, lest the law should apply to Saturday, and so defeat the ends which the friends of Sunday sought. This fact is an unequivocal condemnation of those who call Sunday the " Sabbath," " God's Holy Day," etc. When Congress dare not legislate concerning Sun-day under the name of " Sabbath " because Sab-bath is the biblical and universally recognized name of the seventh day of the week, "Saturday," nothing more is needed to show the false character of the claim that it is a " violation " of " the Sab-bath " to open the World's Fair or to pursue " worldly " business on that day. That little epi-sode in Congress is proving to be a strong factor in the indictment which charges false claims at the door of the advocates of Sunday closing. This is perfectly clear. It is a fact, the claim that Sunday is the Sabbath is false. The statement of the evidence of that falsity, which the Herald makes in,  this paragraph, is so lucid that the most super-ficial reader must realize it, and stop to consider. What is to be the result of a legislative course which starts from such a basis ? What will be its eventual moral effect ? Unrighteous in conception 'and in execution. Can unrighteousness produce righteousness, or must everything pro- duce after its kind ? Speech of Thomas Morgan Before the House Committee on the World's Fair Sunday Opening Resolution.     (Concluded.)   I WAS going to say, Mr. Chairman, that in addition to the authority that I have here set forth, I wish to say that we, work-men of Chicago, particularly and espe-cially demand the right to be heard with more consideration than our opponents. As soon as the word went forth that it was proposed to have an exposition, a world's exposition, in the United States, the labor organizations everywhere re-sponded with gladness to that proposition ; and as soon as it was settled that the World's Fair should be held somewhere in the United States, Chicago workmen put forth their claims to Chicago as the proper geographical point to have a world exposition located. They backed up their request that Chicago should be the place, with petitions from labor organizations throughout the United States, to such an extent that Congressman Hawley was able to stand up in the Congress of:the United States and say, " I hold in my hand peti-
