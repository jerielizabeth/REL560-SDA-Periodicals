Two weeks ago we printed in these columns the appeal of Cardinals Gibbons, Vaughan, and Logue, for the establishment of an inter-national court 'of arbitration. For a number of reasons this subject is wor-thy of more no-tice that it has yet received ei-ther from us or at the hands of the press gener-ally. The three cardinals named did not go so far as to say in so many words that the Papacy ought to be made the su-preme arbiter of the world, but nobody can doubt that such was the purpose of their appeal. " Such a court existed for centuries," say they, " when the nations of Christendom were united in one faith. And have we not seen nations appeal to that same court for its judgment in our own day?" Only One of Many Similar Suggestions. This covert suggestion of Cardinals Gibbons, Vaughan, and Logue, is only one of many similar ones made within the last ten years. To avoid a war in 1885, which Germany dared not undertake because of France, Bismarck turned to the Pope as arbitrator; and Rome, seizing the fact, has ever since, in season and,  out of season, urged that " his holiness " be made the arbiter of the world. In its issue of Feb. 17, 1894, in an article on "The Pope as International Arbitrator," the Catholic Mirror said: " International ar-bitration is gaining ground more and more, and it promises to hasten the day when the sword shall be sheathed forever. . . . " Daring the century from 1793 to 1893 there have been fifty-eight international arbi-trations. . . . From 1793 to 1848, a pe-riod of fifty-five years, there were nine arbi-trations; there were fifteen from 1848 to 1870, a period of twenty-two years; there were four-teen from 1870 to 1880, and twenty from 1880 to 1893. " The most interesting arbitration of the century was that in which the highest repre-sentative of moral force in the world was ac-cepted in 1885 by the apologist of material force to mediate between Germany and Spain. Leo XIII. revived the roll of the popes in the Middle Ages. " The obstacles to an international code are not insurmountable. . . . " An interesting quotation from the Spec-Ptor and English Review says: ' Humanity is  in search of an arbitrator whose impartiality is indisputable. In many respects the Pope is, by position, designed for this office. He occupies a rank which permits monarchs as well as republics to have recourse to him with-out sacrifice of dignity. As a consequence of his mission the Pope is not only impartial be-tween all nations, but he is at such a degree of elevation that their differences are impercep-tible to him. The difficulty about religion is becoming weaker every day. . . . The fact that the most haughty statesman of Eu-rope [Prince Bismarck] recognizes in the face of the world that he can, without loss of dig-nity, submit his conduct in an international affair to th e j adgment of the Pope, is an ex-traordinary proof that the Pope still occu-pies an excep-tional position in our skeptical modern world.' "Why should not the excep-tional position of the Pope be utilized by the nations of the world? He is the highest rep-resentative o f moral force on earth; over 200,000,000 of Christians scat-tered through- out all nations stand at his back, with a moral power which no other human being can command." The Ambition of the Papacy. No one familiar with the situation and with the utterances upon this subject emanating from high sources in the Roman Catholic Church, can doubt that the ambition of the Papacy is to once more dominate the nations something as she dominated them when in 1076, Henry IV. of Germany, " the highest of sec-ular potentates, stood for three days in the courtyard of the castle [of Canossa], clad in
