LIBERTY 55 Daniel II and 12 and Revelation 16, the Turkish Empire was not only to come to its " end " in Europe, but also in Asia. According to the Bible, the battle of Ar-mageddon is to be fought immediately after the Turkish Empire is " dried up." In the preceding issue of this magazine we went quite fully into the Biblical and historical exposition of this question. Since then our position as based upon the prophetic i n - t er p r eta-tion has been verified by the recent war develop-ments.

Luther a n d 11 i s colaborers understood the fulfillment o f this prophecy to constitute a sign of the end of t h e world. In speaking of this prophecy, the great Re-former s a i d, "If we beat back the Turk, t h e prophecy OF TURKEY of Daniel will be fulfilled and the end will be at hand.
