I sobbed and closed the book. (I've loved that tale of freedom since a child.) Within my heart that selfsame love doth hide (If blame there be for such, I guilty plead). I'd rather take the lonely path astride The rugged heights than find my daily meed With rabble, who would blindly harness me With hated reins, and ask me to give o'er My mental freedom, and in thought to be A mawkish manikin forevermore. No! I would live, and I must be complete Within myself; and though my earthly trail May lead to sweet success or to defeat, May lead o'er mountain top or through the vale, I'd rather live in wild, free bliss one day Than years on years and tyrants' rule obey. This call within is nature's truest voice, And I, responding, wondrously rejoice!
