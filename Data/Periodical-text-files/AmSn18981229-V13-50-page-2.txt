Tan founders of the American Republic doubtless be-lieved in expansion. They were no more opposed to such a thing than are the most ardent imperialists who are to-day trying to explain away the Constitution and Dec-laration of Independence in defense of their views. But what is the thing to be expanded? That is the vital question in the whole discussion. Is it the American army and navy? Is it the incubus of militarism? Is it military government, or any other form of arbitrary rule? Are these the things which need expansion for the fulfillment of the national purpose? We think not. Our forefathers expanded the truths which underlie free government. They did this in the Declaration of Independence and the national Constitution. They pro-claimed to all the world the truths which till then they had harbored in their own minds, that all men are by creation equally endowed with certain unalienable rights, and that to preserve these rights is the one legitimate purpose of governments among men. They asserted these as self-evident truths; and they asserted them as much for the inhabitants of the countries of Europe, as for themselves. Upon these principles, the American Republic was founded; and under the influence of this example the up_ plication of these principles in the governments of the world gradually expanded, and all mankind were the gainers. That they were not at once carried fully into effect by the American Government, and that the history of the nation down to the present time has been marked by various denials of these principles in American insti-tutions and laws, are not facts which invalidate the principles, or which constitute an argument for repudiat-ing them to-day. The founders of this Republic believed in the expan-sion of free government. That was the kind of govern-ment they set up for themselves and advocated for all the world; and that is the only kind of government which it can in reason be supposed they would wish to  Ł see extended beyond the shores of the American conti-nent. But is it such government that it is now proposed by-the advocates of "expansion" to extend? No; it is not, claimed that there is to be any "expansion" of free gov-ernment. It is not pretended that "government of the people, by the people, for the people," is to be set up in any of the newly-acquired territory. The "expansion" is to be simply an extension of the authority of the United States GoV'ernment. No pretense of anything else is possible, for it is well known that the people of all these territories, with the possible exception of Porto. Rico, do not want to be ruled by the United States, but want to govern themselves. They are to be governed without their consent, and the government which has ac-tually been set up, so far, in those territories, is the auto-cratic government of military rule. It is explained that this government will be contin ued until the people shall have become fitted for self-gov-ernment. But how long will it take for a people under the despotism of military rule to learn self-government? How long time will be required to establish the principles and institutions of free go vernment under a regime which denies and suppresses them? About as long, evidently, as would be required for a person to learn to swim with-out going in the water. It is not necessary that the inhabitants of Porto. Rico, Hawaii, or the Philippines should be "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" to know how to govern themselves. It is not necessary that they should know all the tricks of the politicians and be stamped with such other marks of "civilization" as usually come to the sur-face in a political campaign, in order to have good gov-ernment. It is not the politicians, and the diplomats, and the bosses, however well educated they may be, that make good government in the United States. In fact, they do nothing to promote good government at all, and much to hinder it. If all such eminent representa-tives of our modern civilization could be transported to-the Philippines, and their places here taken by native-Filipinos, American government would be a good deal better than it is. Here, we have the church in politics; the State and national "bosses" in politics; the "diplomats" who care-everything about policy and nothing about principle; the buyer and seller of public office; and the buyer and seller of votes; and between all these, American govern-ment comes a long way from being the free and just gov-ernment which the signers of the Declaration of Independ-ence and the framers of the national Constitution meant it to be. Good government is not necessarily such a compli-cated affair as might be thought from a study of the political machinery now employed in the government of the United States. The prime essential of good gov-ernment is a disposition to behave one's self and not meddle with the business of others; and this disposition is about as frequently met with in the Islands of the Sea
