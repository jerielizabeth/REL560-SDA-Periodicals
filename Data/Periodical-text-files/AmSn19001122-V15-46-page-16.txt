Those wk.) have not ordered The Sentinel' need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.: , WE print this week a partial report of the pro-ceedings of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Asso-ciation; more will appear later. And immediately following this convention in Wisconsin comes the "Conference_ of Religion" in New York City, of which we will also give a special report. The next few issues of THE SENTINEL will be among the best that have ever been issued. Now-is the right time to circulate a few copies among your friends. " I DON'T understand all this THE SENTINEL says about natural rights and religious liberty," some people are saying. Well, dear readerŠif you are one of theseŠthe subject of man's proper-  relation to the' civil power, and of the distinction between the things of Cesar arid the things of God, is-rather a deep subject, and we can't help that; but it is an ' intensely practical subject. It is one you can not separate from your own eXperienee, and that you will -be called upon some day to explain. We do not ask you to study these things for our benefit, but fOr your own,. The thertes' of, the Scripture are deep, but we can not afford to skip them, neverthe-leSs. .4 .4 HAVE you:seen the "World's Oadook " number of-the Signs of theTimes, pUblished in Oakland, Cal.?

As announced last week, THE SENTINEL. of December 6 will be speci`ally adapted to ,educational effort in connection with the agitaVori 'for closing the Pan-American Exposition on Sunday. 'Do, not forget the date, and do not fail, to share this :effort with us, by circulating a goodly number of this special issue. This number will be profusely illustrated with-half-tone cuts, and printed upon sup'ercalendered: stock, thUs making the paper attractive as well as irisirtictive. The price will be one dollar per hundred, or —eight dollars per thousand to tract,  societies. It will be remembered how far-reaching were the results of the Sunday closing agitation in connection with the World's Fair, when our nation took sod.m-, portant a step in repudiating the principles of Prot-estantism by enacting a confessedly religious law, making as a condition of goVernMental support the closing of the gates on Sunday. We now have op-portunity to recall the tremendous significance of that legislative action under circumstances. that will at once add interest and lend force to that bit of American history. We are confident that friends of religious liberty everywhere will gladly embrace this opportunity to sow the seed of truth under condi-tions so favorable.
