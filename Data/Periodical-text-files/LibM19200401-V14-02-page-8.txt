38 LIBERTY of a union of church and state. Life's ac-tivities are more complicated today, and if everything is going to be prohibited that is unnecessary on Sunday in har-mony with the judgment and discretion of the police court of the District of Columbia, how do we know that the po-lice magistrate will not go to even greater extremes in interpreting what is unnecessary than did the Puritan  magistrate in the seventeenth century I Let every one who is a lover of free American institutions and religious lib-erty send in a vigorous protest against this compulsory Sunday observance bill, H. R. 12504. Write your representative in Congress and give your reasons for being opposed to the employment of force by the civil powers to compel the observance of a church creed.

When a law is ignored, disregarded, vio-lated by the great majority of the peo-ple, the law's enforcement is not even attempted. This truism is demonstrated by the failure of the States to enforce the anti-quated blue laws on their statute books. These laws in our times savor too much of the ridiculous even to think of uni-versally enforcing them. Sunday and the manner of its observ-ance is a good illustration. The Puri-tanical method of observance of the day finds no recognition now, even by the " strictest sect " of the modern Pharisees. The camp is very much divided as to how Sunday should be observed, inas-much as twenty-five million professed Christians differ on this point from other religionists. " A Catechism Primer of Christian Doctrine," by Roderick A. McEachern, priest of Columbus Diocese; published by the Catholic Book Company. Wheel- ing, W.
