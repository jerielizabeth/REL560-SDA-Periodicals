Is it possible that a book with nearly 900 pages, full of the story of the sayings and doings of Jesus while here on the earth, can be of that simple char-acter as to be interesting to children from six to twelve years old, and at the same time contain such wonderful revelations of divine truth as to inspire in men and women of deep Christian experience a love for the book surpassed by none except that for the Bible itself? Yes; this is true as many can testify. The mechanical construction of the book is an achievement of rare merit. More than 300 excellent pic-tures illustrating as many salient points, and trite say-ings of the Master, embellish the work. It is bound in four styles, at prices ranging from $3.50 to $7.00.
