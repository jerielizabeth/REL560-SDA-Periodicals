NOTE.ŠAny one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It: is our invari-able rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be, asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office. SENATOR PLUMB, of Kansas, gave ex-pression to an important truth, when he said : " Whatever domain Government in-vades it dominates. The jurisdiction which it takes it keeps." Those who are asking various measures of religious leg-islation should make a note of this fact. IF the State had the right to require or to forbid one religious observance, it would have the right to require or to for-bid any or all others. This is why all Christians who prize religious liberty as they should, and who are willing that others should enjoy' the same privileges that they themselves do, oppose all State interference in religious matters. They insist that all must be left absolutely free to worship or not to worship, just as they please. THE Bakers' Assembly 5,296 Knights of Labor, of Boston, have resolved to ask the next Legislature of Massachusetts to enact a law prohibiting the opening of bake-shops on Sunday, and a committee was instructed to present the matter to the General Court and to conduct, during the next few months, a vigorous campaign in favor of Sunday closing. The members of the Assembly will, it is stated, request all labor organizations to assist them in this work. -Ł Ł THE Christian Advocate has the follow-ing :Š Speaking of the flag of our country in connection with the schools, the Youth's Companion says: " The flag, rightly regarded, represents many good things besides loyalty; it represents truth, religion, liberty, law, self-sacrifice, mutual help, and for-bearance for a common good." There are men in our country who deny that the flag has anything whatever to do with religion. They would teach the children that there is no religious Significance whatever in the banner of the Republic.; They tell us that it rather signifies a complete divorce of the Nation from religion. They contend that in our country not only are Church and State separated, but religion and the State also. This is'a false and dangerous sentiment. But for religion we would have no Republic. The foundations of our Gov-ernment were laid in the principles of Christianity. The teachings of Christ are interwoven with our laws, our literature, and our national customs and life. The flag represents religion, protects it, and derives from it strength and glory. The idea that " the flag " represents re-ligion is utterly absurd. George Wash- ington, one of the founders of this Repub-lic, and its first President, said: " The Government of the United States is in no sense founded upon the Christian relig-ion," therefore the flag of this country can in no sense represent the Christian relig-ion. And if it did represent the Christian religion what phase of it would it repre.:  sent, Protestant or Catholic ? The men who teach that the flag has no religious significance teach truly, while men who teach the contrary show thereby their de-sire to have their religion enforced by the power represented by the flag, namely, by the State. PURE Christianity, that of the Bible, will never form a union with the world, nor with worldly powers. " A church thoroughly nationalized " is a spiritual harlot according to the word of God; and a " nation thoroughly Christianized," as far as the aegis of law can make it so, is but a repetition of the Dark Ages.- A true Christian nation will be seen only when Christ destroys the national governments of earth and reigns in glory over a people redeemed by divine grace, not by civil law. -ŁŁ CARDINAL GIBBONS is credited with saying : " I do not wish to see the day when the Church will invoke or receive any Government aid to build our churches, or to pay the salary of our clergy, for the Government may then begin to dictate to us what doctrines we ought' to preach, or rather what we ought not to preach." Upon this the Christian at Work remarks : " Now let the Cardinal extend the princi-ple to the schools, and he will be in exact accord with the best Protestant sentiment of the country. The Cardinal is on the right road; only he ought to beware of stopping at the half-way house." A LONG article in the New York Trib-une, in reference to the International Con- gregational Council, held in London, in July, closes with this paragraph :Š It should not be without significance that this Council, with representatives from all the world, passed unanimously a resolution expressing the hope that the Worlds's Fair of 1893, will be closed on Sundays. No one who intelligently notes the signs of the times will deny but that this is significant as an evidence of the rapid and world-wide spread of the movement for the legal enforcement of Sunday ob-servance. Take in connection with this and all that it means the latest judicial expres-sion from Judge Hammond of the United States Court in his decision upon the King case, that " to work on Sunday may be harmless in itself because, as the peti-tioner believes, God has not set apart that day for rest and holiness, and yet, if man  has set it apart in due form by his law for rest, it must be obeyed as man's law, if not as God's law.," These things are significant. They sig-nify the general willingness to accept a legal religion and enforce its dogmas by law, and Also that the necessary legal con-ditions are almost ready. Ł Ł Ł  THE Truth Seeker makes the following excellent point against Judge Hammond's decision in the King case :Š The Judge says that it is not necessary to main-tain that to violate the Sunday observance custom shall be of itself immoral to make it criminal in the eyes of the law. " It may be harmless in itself because, as the petitioner believes, God has not set apart that day for rest and holiness to work on Sunday, and yet, if man has set it apart in due form by his law for rest, it must be obeyed as man's law if not as ,God's law." By this, it is seen, any Legislature can establish religious holydays, enforce their observance, and the United States courts af-ford no redress. We do not believe this is good law; it certainly is monstrously unjust. The Truth Seeker is right; the same power that can forbid work upon one day of the week can forbid it on another day; and if, as Judge Hammond asserts, there is no constitutional limitation upon this power, the minority is left absolutely at the mercy of the majority. "EVERYTHING good," says the " Pearl. of Days," " centers in a Christian Sabbath for the public worship of God. Let this worship cease in any city or town in our country, and in fifty years there would not be a large business enterprise in it. The moral tone of society would be such that business on a large scale could not be done: There would not be confidence enough to enable men to form and manage corporations. No family of culture and refinement would live there. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, would be like the - cities of Egypt and AssyriaŠgiven up to the owls and bats to inhabit." More arrant nonsense was never written. The history of all past civilization dis-proves the claim.
