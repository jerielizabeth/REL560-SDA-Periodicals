44 LIBERTY in me any more, and if you don't drop him, Mike, he will drop you." The whisky business is a lawless des-perado. It tries to " get the drop " on boys and girls, on men and women, on politi-cians and officers. The train-robber pre-sents his pistol with the demand, " Your money or your life." Rum gives no such alternative; its demand is, "Your money and your life."Š Selected. Some Lessons in Figures THE folowing figures are worthy of care-ful study; for they show how much of the people's money is spent. In thirty years the drink bill per capita in the United States has increased fivefold. In 1875 intoxicants cost $5 per capita. In 1885 intoxicants cost $11 per capita. In 1895 intoxicants cost $15 per capita. In 1905 intoxicants cost $25 per capita. In 1905 the citizens of this so-ca:led_, " Christian nation" spent $1,600,000.000 for intoxicants; $600,000,000 for pleasure ; $24,000,000 for chewing-gum; $1o,000,000 for poodle dogs; and $8 000,000 a day for gamb:ing. The amount contributed to foreign missions was $7.500,000. Words of Warning IN persuance of its campaign against strong drink a few years ago, the French Anti-A lcohol Society displayed on walls and other suitable places in Paris, small bills, on which were printed short sentences intended to give pause to bibulous pers-ns, such as the following: Š Alcohol nowadays is responsible for more ravages than pestilence, famine, or war.Š Gladstone. Alcohol is no more a digester than an appetizer. In whatever shape it presents itself, it is only a poison.Š Fransisque Sarcey. Do you know what that man is drinking from the glass which shakes in his trem-bling hand? Š He is drinking the tears and the blood and the life of his wife and children.Š Lainonnais. Alcohol gives neither health nor strength nor warmth nor happiness. It does noth-ing but harm.Š Tolstoi Alliance Nezvs, London. Alcohol WHEN a boy, we heard a drunkard boast-ing that no man had ever been able to throw him in a wresting match. Said a bystander, " There is one that has thrown you many times." " Who?" demanded the boaster. " Hall," was the reply. " What Hall?" said the boaster. " Alco-Hol," was the response. Of course the joke created a laugh; but what a suggestion was in it! A!cohol has not only thrown but slain his thousands. All along the stream of time lie the wrecks of life. Human caricatures, man-made brutes, tears of wives, cries of children, ruined homes, paupers' graves, and moun-tains of crime, mark the pathway of the ravages of this hydra-headed, Briarean-handed, stony-hearted giant.Š Signs of the Times. Temperance Brieflets GRAPE JUICE has kilted more than grape shot.Š Spurgeon. Strong drink is not only the devil's way into a man, but a man's way to the devil. ŠAdam Clarke. I oppose drink because it opposes me. The work I try to do it undoes.Š Lord Brougham. Drink is the mother of want and the nurse of crime.Š Lord Brougham. Nine-tenths of our poverty, squalor, vice, and crime spring from this poisonous tap-root. Society, by its habits, customs, and laws, has greased the slope down which these poor creatures slide to perdition.ŠGeneral Booth. Nothing is so great a friend to the mind of man as temperance. It strengftens the memory, clears the appreer s'on, and sharpens the judgment, aril, in a word, gives reason its free scope of action.ŠDr. South. Our Annual Drink Bill IN its issue of May 8, 1907, the American Grocer gave its estimate of the annual drink of the United States, for the year ending June 3o, 1906, as follows : Š Beer  $852  974,955 Spirits   495,083,239 Wines  102,797,254 $1,450,855,448 Total
