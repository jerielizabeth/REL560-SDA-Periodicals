The Supremacy of the Papacy By Alonzo T. zones V THE PAPACY-THE VERY SAME PAPACY THAT THE WORLD KNEW IN THE TENTH CENTURY-IS TO-DAY AIMING TO SECURE TO HERSELF A RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SHE HAD THIS ONCE. THE ARTICLES THAT ARE APPEARING UNDER THE ABOVE HEADING ARE A STUDY OF HOW SHE USED IT. SINCE IT IS HER OWN BOAST THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES," TO KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH SUCH SUPREMACY WHEN SHE HAD IT IS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH IT WHEN SHE SECURES IT AGAIN. H  AVING obtained a general view of the miseries of Europe under the horrible anarchy of the supremacy of the Papacy, it will not be necessary, nor in-deed have we space, to follow the history in any further detail than is presented in the course of the individual popes, who, on their respective sides, not only kept up but increased this anarchy for a period of forty years. THE BRUTAL MADNESS OF URBAN VI. Pope Urban VI. discovered that some of his cardinals had spojcen of appointing guardians for him, because of his extreme and desperate conduct. The six who seemed to have thought of it were ar-rested by him, and, loaded with chains, were " cast into a close and fetid dun-geon, an old tank or cistern." The in-quisitors whom he sent to question them were so affected by their sufferings that when they returned to report to the pope " two of them burst into tears. Urban sternly taunted their womanly weakness. Theodoric on his own account ventured to urge the pope to mercy. Urban be-came only more furious ; his face red-dened like a lamp, his voice was choked with passion." After having kept the cardinals some time in the dungeon, causing them to " suffer from hunger, thirst, cold and reptiles," Urban next caused them to be  horribly tortured. This occurred in No-cera. Urban was besieged in Nocera ; but, by a sally, he escaped. " He dragged with him the wretched cardinals. During the flight to the galleys, the bishop of Aquila, enfeebled by torture, could not keep his sorry horse to his speed. Urban, suspecting that he sought to escape, in his fury ordered him to be killed; his body was left unburied on the road. With the rest he started across to Sicily; thence to Genoa. The cardinals, if they reached Genoa alive, survived not long. By some accounts they were tied in sacks and cast into the sea, or secretly dispatched in their prisons." Only one of the six was spared. Pope Urban's madness was simply the intoxication of absolute power, and jealousy of rivalry in that power, precisely as was that of Caligula, Tibe-rius, or Nero. In April, 1389, Urban VI., the more to fill his coffers, resorted to the scheme of reducing yet further the term at which the papal jubilee should recur. He made it each thirty-third year, beginning with a jubilee the following year. " Christen-dom was summoned to avail itself of the incalculable blessings of a pilgrimage to Rome, with all the benefits of indul-gences. The treasury of the Holy See was prepared to receive the tribute of the world."Å Milman. However, Urban
