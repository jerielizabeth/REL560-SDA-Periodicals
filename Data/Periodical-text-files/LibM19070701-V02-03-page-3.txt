II   THIRD QUARTER, 1907  No. 3        Survey of the Field THERE is a continuous and steady growth throughout the world in the demands for the legal exaltation of Sunday. There are occasional setbacks in places, but the move-ment for a union of government and relig-ion grows stronger and more determined with each month. Argentina.Ñ A gentleman writing from Argentina states that five years ago all kinds of business and the various industrial occupations were carried on upon Sunday practically as upon other days of the week. However, as a result of the growing agi-tation for Sunday-law enforcement, nearly every business or industrial pursuit is now closed in Argentina on Sunday. Germany.Ñ Concerning the church and state question in Germany the Christian Register says editorially : " The breach be-tween the government and the clerical party in the German Reichstag is widening in a manner that would give some color to the predictions of a conflict between the Ger-man State and the Roman Catholic Church. The clericals, whom Chancellor von Billow is attempting to ignore by eliminating the clerical group from the government's par-liamentary combination, are apparently de-termined to demonstrate to the chancellor, and through him to the kaiser, that they are still a factor to be reckoned with in the transaction of legislative business, and that the government can not hope to carry out its plans in the Reichstag without their co-operation. A grave sign of the times is to be seen on the fact that the struggle in the legislature is finding an expression in social affairs, and that German society is becom- ing divided into two hostile camps on the issue of Clericalism." The question of clericalism in Germany as everywhere else is the question of whether political religionists shall determine the national legislation. The Center (Cath-olic) Party of the German Parliament has for years played a strong hand in the pol-itics of the realm, and has many times blocked urgent legislation until they could secure the laws they desired. Against this power the German Chancellor has set him-self. How successful he will be remains to be seen. England.Ñ By a large majority the first reading of a resolution calling for the dis-establishtvent of the Church in England and Wales was welcomed by the House of Commons. Mr. Birrell, M. P., said that the union of the church and state had worked harm both to the state and the church. " The two independent of each other," says the Christian Register, " would mean temporary confusion with a great permanent increase of individual responsi-bility and happiness." While many see that a union of church and state is wrong, not nearly so many are able to see that in ap-pealing for Sunday laws they are appealing for a union of church and state in fact; that is, appealing for the very thing they admit to be wrong. The Roman Catholic Arch-bishop of Malta is not disposed to submit quietly to the decision of the Colonial Office to maintain equality for all denominations in Malta in the matter of religious liberty. The archbishop has indicated his intention of appealing to the king; and the Protes-
