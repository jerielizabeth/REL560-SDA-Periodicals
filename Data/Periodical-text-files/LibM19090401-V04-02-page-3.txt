              LIBERTY          Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.  Lev. 25 : JO.                            VoL. IV  SECOND QUARTER, 1909  No. 2              Editorial THE increasing demand for religious legislation is a summons to all lovers of religious liberty to continue a campaign of education concerning the principles involved in making religion a matter of legal enactment, and the results which will follow the establishment of religious observances by law. RELIGIOUS liberty does not depend upon the will of the majority, but is the inalienable right of the individual. Gov-ernment can not bestow it, and any at-tempt on the part of government to cur-tail it is a usurpation of power and a violation of the divine principles upon which civil government was established. WHEN the rights of the minority in religious matters are defined, there are some who are ready to cry out zealously in behalf of " the inalienable rights of the majority." The majority has no right of any sort to oppress the minority in things religious. The conscience of the individual can be rightfully opposed to the demand of any number of persons when a religious conviction is at issue ; provided, of course, that no one can plead conscientious conviction as a basis for interfering with the civil rights of others. A Christian Platform As Christians who desire the pros-perity of both the church and the state, we advocate a complete separation of the two. We believe that civil government was ordained by divine authority, just as was the church; but we maintain that a separate sphere was assigned to each one, and that the functions of each are wholly distinct from the other. It is not within the province of the state either to define or to enforce relig-ious dogmas or duties. Neither is it the legitimate work of the church to enact civil laws or to prescribe to the civil power the laws which it should enact. In its sphere the church deals with the relations which exist between man and God; in its sphere the state deals with the relations between man and man, between citizens. The church teaches conformity to the law of God interpreted in its application to man's spiritual need ; the state enacts and enforces laws which pertain to man's temporal welfare, protecting each citizen in the exercise of his rights. To unite church and state, or in any way to confuse these two spheres, will
