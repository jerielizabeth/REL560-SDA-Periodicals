AMERICAN SENTINEL. 131 Items of W. C. T. U. History. BY MRS. S. M. I. HENRY. WE have come far enough away from the beginnings of the Women's Christian Temperance Union so that we can look at it as history; and it has occurred to me that the story of it, from my own standpoint, might not be without interest to the readers of the SENTINEL, and might serve a purpose in bringing about a better ac-quaintance which would facilitate cooperation in many lines of work for the alleviation of the distresses of the world in these last days. No body of Christian workers has ever been less un-derstood by its natural allies than this one; while those who, for good reason, were its bitter enemies, had an instinctive understanding of it, which finds its counter-part in the knowledge which the rat has of the cat, or which the legion which possessed the poor demoniac of Gadara had of the gentle Presence which intruded upon him in his place among tice tombs. Those who have at heart the perpetuation of the liquor traffic and its kindred vices, have never had any doubt as to the source from which this organization sprung, nor of the danger to their interests which was folded up in the bud of the W. C. T. U. They have known that we must be watched; that we must be fenced against at every turn! They have been just as much afraid of us as though the prophet of the Lord had not said things which make it clear that as far as this world is concerned their traffic is safe; that it will increase in spite of all that we can do against it; its agents waxing worse and worse to the end of time. In the beginning our women had, and many still have, but a superficial view of the evil known as the liquor traffic. It seemed to us at first to be a creature of human greed only; greed of money and of power which, however, could not be stronger, as we supposed, than the philanthropic instinct which we believed was in the nature of every man, if we could only find it, and to the search for which we set ourselves with diligent earnest-ness and faith. It was after years of the most bitter experience that some of us discovered that the true source of the evil which we had been searching out was not in man; was, in fact, just as far beyond human power to produce, perpet-uate, or to destroy, as was anything which concerned the destruction or the salvation of a soul; that indeed soul-salvation or ruin was the key to the situation; that the washing of the individual sinner from the pollution of appetite, greed, and selfishness of every sort was the solution of the problem; such washing as would cause the politician to cease to court the "saloon element" for votes; the drunkard for his treats; that the salvation of Christ was the only remedy for all who were entangled in the meshes of this multifarious evil; that the money, men, and politics, which lived upon it, and which in turn  were kept alive by it, must beŁ set at liberty, i. e., disen-tangled from error by the same truth by which Christ alone can give freedom. It required years of heart-breaking effort at trying to close saloons by crusade prayers and by law; at trying to secure "local option" and so to quarantine each cor-poration against every other; as well as trying to pull men and women out of the fires of debased appetite, to bring us, in any degree, to comprehend the awful power that was incarnate in the liquor traffic. One day about twenty years ago, at the annual ses-sion of the temperance convocation at Lake Bluff, Ill., a great light of truth flashed upon me and almost bewil-dered me by its terrible significance. Alcohol was Satan's counterfeit of the Holy Spirit of God; it was not simply a drug, an article of commerce, a thing of any sort; it was vastly moreŠit was the vehicle in which he had chosen to ride at the head of the hosts of destructive agencies in the world, as the antagonist of the gospel, and was ab-solutely invincible to human effort, unless led and di-rected by that "Mightier than the strong man armed," who alone could know how to circumvent his plans. No supernatural power can ever be overcome by natural means; only by some other supernatural power more mighty than itself. Alcohol was appropriate as the visible form in which the enemy of God and man should become incarnate. A quick subtile poison chemically unchangeable, and incapable of being so disguised as to modify its dire effects; a sword of sure destruction that cut through every sheath and left the keen, naked edge exposed and ready for its service of death. It was recog-nized in its true character as such a counterfeit as long ago as the day of Pentecost, when the people witnessed the display of divine power and were "all amazed and in doubt, saying to one another, What meaneth this? While others mocking said, These men are full of new wine." Not that the fullness of the Spirit of God would ever really simulate drunkenness, but a counterfeit "baptism of the Spirit," or, in other words, fanaticism, with which doubtless the apostles were charged, would naturally take that form. The:diabolical power with which this drug is invested has become very bold in its office as a counterfeit. Let any of my readers put it to the test. Take a sheet of paper and in parallel columns write what each proposes to do for its followers, and see that it has promised to its victims all that the Holy Spirit has ever promised, excepting one gift, and in that one exception it has gone beyond the divine Word with that recklessness that leads fools to rush in where angels fear to tread. It has not claimed to make men pure, but it has dared to promise to make them stronger; forgetful of poverty, shame, and sorrow; if not actually rich, honorable, and happy; at all events more satisfied in impurity than'the SpiritŁ of God could make them in all the purity which he could produce. It has to many made purity appear as con-temptible, "womanish weakness," and uncleanness as the only true manliness.
