C., Dec. 11-14, 1919. The convention was purposely held in Washington at this time, in order to make an impression upon Congress in behalf of Sunday legis-lation. The Lord's Day Alliance and the Pastors' Federation of Washington joined hands in drafting a Sunday bill for the District of Columbia. During the all-day sessions that lasted three full days, drastic Sunday legislation was practically the only subject that was dis-cussed. When one attends a Lord's Day Alli-ance convention, it is no stretch of the imagination for him to feel that he has been suddenly transported back to the times of the Spanish Inquisition. The spirit of intolerance is an essential part of the creed. They actually think they are doing God's will when they perse-cute those who hold opposing views. It was very evident that they had lost their grip upon the public. Outside the reg-ular attendance at church services on Sunday, they seldom had fifty people present at any of their regular sessions. The rigorous Sunday blue laws of Pu-ritan New England were extolled to heaven, and most of the speakers boasted of their ancestral connections with the Puritans and the Scottish Covenanters of the faith of the olden days. Dr. Millington, the chairman of the Sunday Observance Association of the District, said : " We may not be able to control the weather, but we are going to control Congress in refer- ence to the securing of a Sunday law for the District of Columbia." They entertain wonderful ideas about the importance of their movement. The triumph of the Lord's Day Alliance in the legislative bodies of the land means to them the setting up of Christ's king-dom upon the earth and the glorious tri-umph of the militant church over all her foes. The universal enforcement of rigid Sunday laws, irrespective of indi-vidual or group convictions, is to them a sure panacea for all the ills in this troubled world. They are very confident that their Sunday bill, which they drafted in har-mony with their intolerant views, will be approved by Congress this session. They passed resolutions calling upon all the Protestant and Catholic churches in America to assist them in a nation-wide campaign in behalf of the passage of their Sunday bill. One of the speakers said : " I believe that if the proper steps were taken, the support and co-operation of the Ro-man Catholics could be obtained." Dr. Harry C. Bowlby, the national sec-retary of the Lord's Day Alliance, re-plied: " The Roman Catholic Church has not in many places given the support we ought to have. But we had the solid support of the dio-cese of Albany, when a Sunday bill was pend-ing before the New York Legislature." Canon Wm. Sheafe Chase, D. D., of Brooklyn, N. Y., interjected the state-ment that " the Roman Catholic Church closes its Sunday at twelve o'clock noon. We will have to reckon with this, because they claim 20,000,000 people in this na- 43
