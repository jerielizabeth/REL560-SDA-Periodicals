AMERICAN SENTINEL, New York City: The Bible came to hand all right. To say that I am pleased with it will but faintly describe my feelings. It would take too much space to enumerate its many points of excellence, so I will sum it all up in the one word "su-perb." There are so many "aids to the study of the Scrip-tures," and they are so helpful and just what I have been wishing for since I became a " Bible Christian." Friends and neighbors all say, "I wish I had one like it," and " So cheap." Our seventeen-year-old daughter is about to start out to obtain subscriptions for the SENTINEL, as she wishes for one "just like it." Please accept my warmest thanks, and believe me to be, Ever sincerely yours, R. G. W.

THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST BOOKS THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN ON THE RELATION OF THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION. It shows how Christianity advanced in the Roman Empire, not only without the aid of the State, but in the face of the bitterest opposition from the State; it discusses what the Christian should render to God, and what to the State, and how the powers that be are ordained of God. The book then takes up the history and principles of the movement so active now in the United States, looking toward having  the Church try to regulate and cleanse politics, and shows what will be the certain results of following the policy advocated by some of these church men. No matter what your views upon this question, you cannot afford to miss reading this book.. Cloth, 378 pp., . $1.00. Paper Covers, . . .40.
