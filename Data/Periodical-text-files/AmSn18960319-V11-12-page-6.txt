94 AIVIIMELICA.N VoL. 11, No. 12. tremely liable to oppose justice, the modern idea of three grand departments, each being a check upon the other, sprang into existence. First, there was the king, then the counselors of the king, and finally, the differentiation of these counselors into the judicial and legisla-tive departments. Bat law is separate and distinct from each of these three departments of government. The law is over them all, and each is amen-able to the law. The idea that the legislature is the creator of and above law is, in the light of political evolution, absurd. The truth of the matter, as drawn from political history, is that the legislature defines what law is. The judiciary applies the law to the particular case at issue. The executive enforces the law as it has been. applied. All three departments are under the law, and the action of each must be governed by law. Each officer, therefore, whether legislative, judicial or executive, swears that he will sup-port the law and act in accordance with its provisions. Each official, therefore, swearing to support the law, must have some under-standing of it in order to support it; and his understanding of it becomes, to him, the law. In other words, in order to support it he must have some idea of what he is to support; and this " idea" of what the law is, is, in legal parlance, termed " construing " it. Every man, therefore, who has an idea of what law is, construes the law, and any one denying the right of an executive officer to construe the law would deny his right to have any idea of what the law is. He must either be an ig-noramus or non compos mentis. The mere statement of the case reduces the proposition to absurdity. The executive, therefore, must construe the law and totally ignore void statutes, and the law will hold him accountable for any palpa-ble neglect in refusing so to do. A case in Mexico recently came to the writer's notice. A judge, in a fit of anger, passed the death sentence upon a man absolutely contrary to all law and reason. The executive, through sympathy with the judge, or out of ignorance, executed the sentence according to the order of the judge. The case necessarily attracted a great deal of attention. It had hardly be-come known, however, before both the judge and the executive officer were arrested for murder, and were condemned accordingly. The justice of the sentence must be conceded, for otherwise there could be no official con-duct of a judge which would be ground for impeachment. If he is to be the sole judge of what the law is, his decisions could not be appealed from; but in our system of govern-ment there is no such thing as absolute inde-pendence vested in any official. The legislature passes upen the acts of the judiciary and the executive by a limited power of impeachment; the, executive passes upon the acts of the leg-islature and judiciary by means of a discretion in the enforcement of law, and the judiciary reviews the acts of the legislature and passes upon the acts of the executive by means of its judicial procedure. In this way each depart-ment exercises certain checks and balances over each of the other departments, though acting within a sphere of its own, and yet at the same time by virtue of the nature of this limited control, the independence of each is maintained. This is known in its perfection as the American system of checks and bal-ances. One of the most notable instances of the relation of the executive to the judicial de-partments came prominently into view during Jackson's administration. Chief Justice Mar-shall rendered a decision contrary to Jackson's idea of what the law was in a certain case;  and when the sentence of Marshall was brought to Jackson's attention, he said: " John Mar-shall has made his decision, now let him enforce it." It is needless to add that the decision of the court was not carried out. The very purpose of the differentiation of government into three departments was to effect this result. It was to subject every decision of government to review by persons looking at the matter from different points of view. The purpose was to afford protection to any who might suffer from the action of some one department by having the action reviewed by some other department. Whenever the exec-utive becomes the mere machine of the judi-ciary the life and object of our present system are gone. There might as well be but one department of government as three depart-ments doing merely the work of one. Gov-ernment exercises a power that is almost ab-solutely despotic, and for this despotic power to be used by any one man or any one set of men is manifestly opposed to the purposes of the framers of our Constitution, and to the whole theory of republican government. It is therefore evident that it is the duty of the executive to pass upon the constitutional-ity of statutes at all times. It is therefore the duty of the executive officer to refuse to enforce any unconstitutional Sunday statute on the ground that it is unconstitutional, no matter what may be the pressure brought to bear upon him. In swearing to support the Constitution, in the eyes of the law he refuses to enforce or even to recognize as law any statute contrary to the constitution which he swears to sup-port. It is therefore just as much a duty for the executive officer to pass upon the consti-tutionality of a Sunday statute as it is for the,  judiciary officer, and he has no more right to arrest persons under an unconstitutional stat-ute than had the Mexican executive officer to execute a man under the illegal and des-potic decree of the Mexican judge. Jackson's idea of constitutional law is the only one that the American people can logi-cally accept. Any other idea is opposed to our whole system of law and theory of govern-ment. The law on this point is very tersely stated, in the following decision from the Su-preme Court of Kansas:Š " It is claimed by counsel for plaintiff in error, that the point raised by instruction is, that inferior courts and ministerial officers have no right to judge of the constitutionality of a law passed by a legislature. But is this law? If so, a court created to interpret the law must disregard the constitution in form-ing its opinions. The constitution is law,Šthe fundamental law,Šand just as much to be taken into consideration by a justice of the peace as by any other tribunal. When two laws apparently conflict, it is the duty of all courts to construe them. If the conflict is irreconcilable, they must decide which is to prevail; and the constitution is not an excep-tion to this rule of construction. If a law [statute] were passed in open, flagrant viola-tion of the constitution, should a justice of the peace regard this law [statute] and pay no attention to the constitutional provision ? If that is his duty in a plain case, is it less so when the construction becomes more difficult ? "* CIVIL government pertains only to that which the term itself impliesŠthat which is civil. The purpose of civil government is civil, and not moral. Its function is to preserve order in society. RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN THE UNITED STATES.* " ALL men are created equal, and are en-dowed by their Creator with certain unalien-able rights." The first and greatest of all the rights of men is religious right. Religion is the duty which men owe to their Creator, and the manner of discharging it. The first of all duties is to the Creator, because to him we owe our existence. Therefore the first of all commandments, and the first that there can possibly be, is this: " Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord thy God is one Lord; and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; this is the first commandment." Mark 12: 29, 30. This commandment existed as soon as there was an intelligent creature in the universe; and it will continue to exist as long as there shall continue one intelligent creature in the universe. Nor can a universe full of intelli-gent creatures modify in any sense the bearing that this commandment has upon any single one, any more than if that single one were the only creature in the universe. For as soon as an intelligent creature exists, he owes his existence to the Creator. And in owing to him his existence, he owes to him the first consideration in all the accompaniments and all the possibilities of existence. Such is the origin, such the nature, and such the measure, of religious right. Did, then, the fathers who laid the founda-tion of this nation in the rights of the people Šdid they allow to this right the place and deference among the rights of the people which, according to its inherent importance, is justly its due ? That is, Did they leave it sacred and untouched solely between man and his Creator ? The logic of the Declaration demanded that they should; for the Declaration says that governments derive " their just powers from the consent of the governed." Governments, then, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, can never of right exercise any power not delegated by the gov-erned. But religion pertains solely to man's relation to God, and to the duty which he owes to him as his Creator, and therefore in the nature of things it can never be delegated. It is utterly impossible for any person ever, in any degree, to delegate or transfer to an-other any relationship or duty, or the exercise of any relationship or duty, which he owes to his Creator. To attempt to do so would be only to deny God and denounce religion, and even then the thing would not be done; for, whatever any man might do, his relationship and duty to God would still abide as fully and as firmly as ever. As governments derive their just powers from the governed; as governments cannot justly exercise any power not delegated; and as it is impossible for any person in any way to delegate any power in things religious; it follows conclusively that the Declaration of Independence logically excludes religion in every sense and in every way from the juris-diction and from the notice of every form of government that has resulted from that Dec-laration. This is scriptural, too; for to the defini-tion that religion is " the recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience," the scripture responds: " It is written, as I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself. to God." Rom. 14: 11, 12. To the statement that religion is " man's * Mayberry v. Kelly, 1 Kansas Reports, p. 116. * From chap.
