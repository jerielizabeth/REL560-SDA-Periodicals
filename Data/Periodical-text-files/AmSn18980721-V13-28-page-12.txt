444 AMERICAN SENTINEL. "Horrible!" exclaimed Julia March. "Did he never let him out? How did he get anything to eat?" "He did not let him out for many years,Å the king's heart knew no mercy. As for eating, that little item did not trouble Louis much, he had only to arrange with the keeper of the horrible little cage to shove in enough vict-uals through the iron grates to keep the wretched soul and body together. The iron door was never allowed to be opened." "0 what a horrible punishment! I should think he would have grown to look like the wild beasts, as King Nebuchadnezzar did," said Harry Ray. "That is exactly what he did do," answered Professor Carman, for his nails grew like claws and his hair like eagles' feathers." "Did King Louis ever see him in this awful condition,' asked Maggie Palmeter, shuddering. "0 yes; he used to go on purpose to see him, to gloat his eyes on the awful sight. In our next study we will learn something about a great quarrel which Louis the Eleventh had with the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold." MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE. " Thy Kingdom Come, Thy Will be Done on Earth." "Buy what about the verse that says God's glory shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea' ? asked Charlie. "I'm thinking of the millennium," said Charlie, as Mrs. Ross looked up inquiringly. "But that versewill be fulfilled after the millennium." "How, mama? The last we studied about was the fire coming down from heaven and devouring Satan and his hosts. I want to ask you a lot of questions about that too." "Let me answer your first question first. The fire that falls on the evil hosts will also consume from the earth itself, the curse that has caused it to wither and decay. Peter says, The elements shall melt with fervent heat.' Isaiah says, 'It is the day of the. Lord's venge-ance, and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch." " Where will the city be during the terrible fire ?" "I believe it will be in the midst of the fire. The prophet asks, ' Who among us shall dwell with the de-vouring fire? Who among us shall direll with everlasting burnings ?' The answer is, 'He that walketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.' The prophet tells what such people will see. He says, 'Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty; they shall behold the land of far distances. . . . thine eyes  shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down.' "Everlasting burnings? Will the city always re-main in the midst of fire? Is the earth to be hell? I keep getting mixed up in my ideas, mama." "No; the burnings will cease when all that will burn is consumed. Malachi says, Ye shall go forth, and tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under your feet.' When speaking of the burning of the earth, Peter says, 'Nevertheless we according to his promise look for new (or more properly, renewed) heavens and a new (or renewed) earth wherein dwelleth righteous-ness.' John saw just how it would appear in its renewed state, and says, 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had pas-ed away, and there was no more sea.' Isaiah says, "The wilder-ness and the solitary place shall be glad for them, and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.'" "How beautiful !" exclaimed Charlie. Will it really be the earth, the solid old earth ?" "It will be a solid earth then, my boy; but not an old earth. It will be the earth as it was when it first came from God's hand in its primeval glory." "How long will we live in the earth then?" "Always, Charlie. The earth was given to the chil-dren of men." " Well, I always thought the earth was all right if the people in it were only well, beautiful, and good." "They will be there. `The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.' As for the beautiful, John says, 'It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but when He shall appear, we shall be like him,' and you know he is alto-gether lovely.' And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;' and 'the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away." "There will be no oppression in the new earth, mama." "No indeed. God's glory, and his glory is love, will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea. " They won't need any prisons. No one will be look-ing for heretics. Those who dwell there will have' no check put on thought and love. They will follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, and there will be no Cal-vary in the path." "Do you suppose we will live as we do here, mama?" "Isaiah says we 'shall build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them."' " Why, mama, eternal life never looked more delight-ful to me. Will we do just as we please?" "Yes, because we shall delight in the law of God." "Will we keep, the Sabbath there, mama ?" "Yes indeed. God's memorial is from generation to generation. The memorial-  of his creative power will stand forever. Isa. 66:22, 23, says, 'For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make, shall
