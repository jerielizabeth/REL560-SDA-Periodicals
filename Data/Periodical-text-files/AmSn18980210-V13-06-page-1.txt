 "IF ANY MAN SEAR IFIY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT."--Jesus Chirist.    VoL. 13, No. 6. NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 10, 1898. Single copy 3 cents.           The, American Sentinel is published in the interests of religious libertyŠChristian and Constitutional. WIT Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for,  it (Entered at the New York Post-office.) A. SUNDAY law is a poor 'substitute for moral back-bone. "HONESTY is the best policy ;" and this means to be honest with your conscience. THE individual who rates policy above principle evi-dently imagines that time outweighs eternity. THE modest demand of the National Reformers is that the people will please allow them to be conscience for the government. - IF people did not choose to be so independent of God, they would not be so miserably dependent upon their fellow mortals. IF the Constitution is a godless document because it does not contain the name of God, is the Book of Esther a godless book? DOES the "civil Sunday" prove the theory of evolu-tibn?

If the world leaves them free to enjoy the exercise of their rights, well and gdod. but in any case their enunciation of the doctrine of individual rights, as with any other Christian doctrine, is for the purpose of bearing witness to the truth, which concerns all men alike. Before the bar of truth all men stand; by it all must be judged.
