"IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT."ŠJesus Christ.  VOLUME 14. NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 23, 1899. NUMBER 8.      THE fragrance of Christianity is not disseminated by force. WHEN Chris-tianity is put in-to human law, all the love in it is left out. og - FIRST be mas-ter of yourself; then you will not want to be mas-ter of anybody else. EVERY man has the ability to govern him-self, and no man has the ability to govern more than himself. THERE is noth-ing about the true religion which would sug-gest a "bluelaw" even to an athe-ist. THE true am-bassador for God will seek to win men by the grace Łof God, not to .command men by law. A TYPE OF STATESMAN DEVELOPED BY THE DEMAND FOR RELIGIOUS LEGISLATION. THE cry is made by the great religio-political organizations, that the country must have "Chris-tia,n statesmen." These great bodies aim, through their political power, to exclude from Congress and the legislatures men who do not conform to their ideas of Christianity. But when they pledge their power to the candidate who will vote for religious measures, many men will join hands with them with whom Christianity is a policy rather than a principle of the heart; and the legislative as-semblies will be more than ever filled with men working for their own interests rather than the inter-ests of the people. SO LONG as God tolerates the dev-il, it will not look well for people -taking the name of Christ to be intolerant of their brethren. F Christians will pay enough attention to the example of Christ, they will have no time or inclination to force others to pay attention to them, IN the temple of liberty, the rights of the weak are represented at the top, not at the bottom. THE more poli-tics in the church, the more hypoc-risy in legisla-tion. A NATION, like an individual, might often prof-it by having the grace to ac-knowledge itself in the wrong.
