No individual can be compelled to walk in the path-way of righteousness. Gon cannot accept any service that is sought to be rendered to him through. Caesar. - - 4.1-4 4.Ł THE preservation of individual rights is necessary to the formation of right character. Is it true that the church's power and her opportu-nities to do her appointed work are provided her by the Lord? or are they contingent upon the popular ballot and the action of legislatures? THE difference between a Christian and a "Christian nation" is that a Christian is phenomenally slow to take offense at an injury or insult, while a "Christian nation" is phenomenally quick to do just the opposite. THE theory that men can be compelled to be good, by law,-is the old pagan and carnal theory that a person must do good in order to be good. The truth, as em-bodied in the gospel, is that a person must be good in order to do good. # f 4. 4 For Conscience' Sake. HUMAN law fights crime by shutting up the criminal; the divine law fights sin by liberating the sinner. THERE is good conduct by law in the penitentiary; but this does not make a model community out of the inmates. A SUNDAY law never developed anybody's moral courage, manliness, independence, honesty, or love of principle. "THE kingdom of Satan failed because it was founded upon the love of power. The kingdom of Christ succeeded because it was founded upon the power of love." THE effort to enforce Sunday upon the people by law is an effort to make one man's liberty judged by another man's conscience, which is directly contrary to Christian-ity. 1 Car. 10:29. THE Christian is. in all things governed by the dic-tates of conscience. For conscience' sake he is careful to render to Ccesar that which is Csar's, as well as to give unto God that which is God's. This is in accordance with the plain instructions of that Word which is the Christian's rule of life. "Whatso-ever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not unto men," is the exhortation given in the epistle to the Co-lossians (chap. 3:23), and the apostle Paul makes a still more definite application of the pririciple in the thirteenth chapter of Romans. There the Christian' is enjoined to be "subject unto the higher powers," and it is said (v.5), " Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake." Only conscientiously, therefore, can the Christian be subject to the "powers that be," in a scriptural way. When a law is made, therefore, which conflicts with conscience, it strikes at the very mainspring of the Chris-tian's action as regards his duty toward the state. If he yields his conscience in deference to the demands
