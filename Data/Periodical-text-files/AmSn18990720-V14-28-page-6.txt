Anything less is Spanish tyranny, and we are sorry that this Americanism has not yet been learned even by some of our progressive Catholics of Irish descent. Aggressive Mormonism. WRITING in The Examiner, of July 6, the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City states the fol-lowing regarding the aggressiveness of Mormonism in -the nation, religiously and politically:Š "Mormonism is vastly more than a mere local and religious question; it is as vitally related to the nation, not only religiously, but politically and socially, as ever slavery was, and is for every American a matter of the largest, widest, and profoundest concern. "The additions to the Mormons for last year are re-reported to be 63,000. Nowhere is their increasing strength more apparent than in the States adjoining Utah. One quarter of the wards and bishops of Western Mormonism were found in these neighboring States two years ago. So great is their influence in the State of Idaho that, when the last Congress was being flooded with petitions concerning B. H. Roberts, Utah's Con-gressman-elect, the very legislature of Idaho passed a resolution in his favor. The near future seems to hold in store for the Mormons, inevitably, the balance of power in these States and the balance of power in Con-gress. "From a national point of view the aggressive atti-tude with reference to polygamy is of very great mo-ment. When the escheated property was returned, it was with the understanding that the rightfulness of the practise of polygamy should not be inculcated (See joint resolution No. 11 of the first session of Congress). When Statehood was granted it was because of a solemn covenant with the nation that polygamy should cease. But, from one end of the State to the other, the teaching of polygamy, as the true principle of social life, has been steadily continued, the missionaries of the various de-- nominations, who frequently hear it in the tabernacles, being witnesses. "The significant feature of this teaching is that it is especially put to the front by those who have the ear of the young people. At the joint conference of the Young Men's and Young Women's Societies at Castle Dale, as reported in the Salt Lake dailies, June 15, 1898, one of the speakers, a woman, defended the practise of polyg-amy as a divine command of God, and was followed by an apostle, who declared that it was as much a part of the faith as ever. According to the Salt Lake Herald, of August 15, 1898, the Joint Quarterly Conference held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle the preceding day was re-galed with an account of a young woman who had said that the justness of polygamy was specially revealed to her in connection with a dance, the universal and ac-cursed Mormon amusement. A Mormon official was dancing in the same set, and she had said that when she touched the hand of that good man she wished to be one of his wives, even if he had fifty others. This was unblushingly published by a married woman to assem-bled thousands of young people! . . . "B. H. Roberts, . . . is the editor of the Improve-ment Era, the official organ of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association, a magazine which contains serious articles on art, literature and religion, and which has a paid up subscription list of 6,000. In this maga-zine for May, 1898, there is a brilliant article by its bril-liant editor, in which he champions polygamy, and de-clares that it 'must be not only not bad, but positively good, pure, and holy.' And B. H. Roberts is the idol of Utah's young men. "That which is true with reference to the continu-ance of the teaching of polygamy is commonly believed to be true with reference to its practise. In a paper passed by the Presbytery of Utah, August 29, 1898, it is stated that this living in polygamous relations has `resulted in the birth of more than one thousand chil-dren since Statehood was granted, Jan. 4, 1896.' . . . "Mormon aggressiveness along national lines reached its climax when B. H. Roberts was given permission to be a candidate for the Fifty-sixth Congress. For, ac-cording to the manifesto of April, 1896, he could not be a candidate without permission, and under the circum-stances this was tantamount to a guarantee of election. The opposition to Mr. Roberts is not because he is a Mormon. If those who dominate Mormon affairs had not thought the time was ripe to make a test of certain matters, and had brought to the front some man like our honored governor, there would have been no pro-test. . . . "It is no railing accusation against the Mormons as a people, to say that Mormonism, as a system, is an ag-gressive menace to our nation." How is Mormonism to be conquered? The writer answers this question by pleading that Christian mis-sionaries be sent in strong force to bring the gospel to the people of Utah. He does not call for the enactment of new legislation; and in this he is right. He says:Š "While the 200,000 Mormons of Utah are marching their brigades out, why do not the 18,000,000 Protest-ants of America march theirs in? There is not an asso-ciation or presbytery or conference anywhere in our land which, if it understood the menace of Mormonism, and realized that it could join in a great campaign in Utah, would not lay its hand upon some man in its midst, of good judgment, warm Christian experience and godly life, and say to him, 'Go, and we will furnish the needed munitions of war.' And he would go, even at the cost of sacrifice, to tell the story of Jesus; for the spirit of de-votion and heroism is not dead. There are many among us who are second to none in willingness to endure hard-ship as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. "Such a corps, clad with the helmet of salvation and the breastplate of righteousness, shod with the prepara-tion of the gospel of peace, and armed with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, would be mighty to the pulling down of strongholds. The real truth con-cerning Mormonism would be flashed back to everyplace outside of Utah whence the missionaries came, the real truth concerning the gospel and its power to save would be heard in every hamlet and every home in our fair State, and the truth would make us free. Such a cam-paign, and such results as the Lord would give through the operation of the Holy Spirit among this misguided
