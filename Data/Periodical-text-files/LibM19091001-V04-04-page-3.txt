IV FOURTH QUARTER, 1909 No. 4             Editorial WHEN I am unwilling to grant to my neighbor what I ask for myself from him, I write myself less of a Christian than I ask him to be. GOD holds each individual accountable for his own choice ; and he who attempts to choose for another in religious con-cerns and enforces his choice upon that other, interferes with the whole plan and purpose of God's government ; and that is what is done wherever state and religion unite. THE National Reform Association holds, as expressed in its recent conven-tion at Winona Lake, Ind., that the rule of the people must lead to " political des-potism and religious intolerance," and that " not the will of the majority of the people," but the law of God as inter-preted by the clergy, must be "the su-preme law of the land."

Moreover, being a religious institution, it is entirely outside the purview of civil legislation. Jesus Christ himself put a sharp line of sep-aration between religion and the state;
