WE do not mean that a National Sunday Law is now ready, but that a treatise under this name, prepared by Alonzo T. Jones, is now ready for circulation. This pamphlet contains the arguments in behalf of the rights of American citizens, and in oppositon to the Blair Sunday-rest bill, which Mr. Jones presented before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, Dec. 13, 1888. Mr. Wilbur. F. Crafts has -pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING," And Mr. Jones's comments will make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruption, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is Based on Scripture and History, Constitution and Law, Showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-law movement of the fourth century, the Sunday-law movement of the nineteenth century, the methods used in securing indorsements to the petition for the Blair Sunday bill, and the workings of such Sunday laws as are proposed for the United States. ,The work contains one hundred and ninety-two pages.

IF a man should ask to be ad-mitted into membership in a Christian church while asserting his unbelief in Christianity there is not one of the ministers of the American Sabbath Union who would admit him to membership. If anyone should ask to be bap-tized while maintaining an atti-tude of positive unbelief in Jesus Christ there is not ono of these ministers who would administer to him Christian baptism. They would deny his right to have any share whatever in it. It is so also in the matter of the Lord's supper. It is logically so also in the matter of the Christian Sab-bath. But instead of standing logically to their proposition, they inconsistently demand laws by which men, who glory in in-fidelity and atheism, and in their hatred to Christianity, shall be compelled to observe the Chris-tian Sabbath as a day of rest. In other words, they demand that the United States Government shall enact- laws by which all the people who are not Christians and who do not want to be, shall be compelled to act as though they were Christians. If it be the Christian Sabbath, these peo-ple have no right to consent that anybody but Christians shall keep it; and far less have they any right to compel people to keep it who are not Christians. If the church has the right to use the power of the Government to compel men to observe the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest, has she not an equal right to use the same power to compel the same persons to observe the same institution as a day of wor-ship? And has she not an equal right to use the same power to compel all men to observe Chris-tian baptism, and to belong to the Christian church ? In short if she has the right to use the power, where is the limit to the exercise of that right, except in her own arbitrary will? The re-sults here suggested will follow as surely as the power is ob-tained. For, although the church is always illogical and inconsist-tent in demanding the use of the civil power, she is always strictly logical and consistent in the use of that power to the utmost limit. The only safety is in not allow-ing her the use of the civil power to the slightest extent. ROMANISM AND CIVIL LIBERTY BY HON. WILLIAM JACKSON ARMSTRONG.
