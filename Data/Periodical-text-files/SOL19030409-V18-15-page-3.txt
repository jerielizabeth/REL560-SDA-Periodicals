7The coffoell OF CHRUSTillYf LE3,0077 VoL. XVIII NEW YORK, THURSDAY, APRIL 9, 1903 No. 15     A majority has no more right to do in-justice than has a minority.

These people certainly have queer ways of doing things. When the United States decided to govern its dependencies outside the Con-stitution it gave the Papacy a mighty van-tage ground, which she has not been slow to perceive and take advantage of. Read the article on " The Supremacy of the Pa-pacy " this week. Representatives of the Papacy in the United States hold that the principle of separation of church and state does not apply " among a people unanimously of
