The Two Republics ROME AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA "The knowledge of it [history] is valuable only as it leads us to form just calculations with respect to the future."ŠMacaulay. With this idea in view, the author has presented a comparative study of these two nations. A proper understanding of the causes that led to the overthrow of the Roman Republic should enable us to avoid these mis-takes in our own country, Such knowledge is especially valuable as we see our nation drifting perilously near to the rocks of Imperialism. Ex-Senator W. T. Tolley, of Tennessee, says: "If I had ten thousand dollars to devote to the cause of popular intelligence and sound, wholesome reading, I would freely give it in aid of the circulation of this masterly work." The New York Sun says: "It seems as though it had left nothing unsaid which needed to be said on this subject." 896 pages, 67 illustrations Cloth, marble edges The Great Nations of To-Day Ten thrilling chapters trace the mighty events which have produced the great nations of to-day, and brought them to the position where they now stand, facing the woe of the seventh trumpet which will be "not only the shipwreck of nations, but of the great globe itself." The remaining thirteen chapters con-sider the "Third Angel's Message," which to-day calls all men to the keeping of the com-mandments of God and the faith of Jesus, that they may be delivered in the "time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation, that is now impending the great na-Ł tions of to-day." 9 illustrations, 5 colored maps, Paper wrapper Christian Patriotism In view of the wide-spread corruption of government and the forsaking of republican principle, what attitude should the Christian assume toward his country? The principles of true "Christian Citizenship" are set forth. Cloth 104 pages = 40c - $1.75 - 25c ADVERTISEMENTS 197 00000 Ł Ł Ł Ł Ł 000000 ŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁ 00000 ŁŁŁŁ 000 . 000 ŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁ,ŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁ. Ł Ł Ł probably no living man has made so exhaustive a study of history, with a Ł Łl 7liew to the solution of present-day problems, as Alonzo Trevier Jones. Ł Ł With this object in mind he has made, for many years, most thorough Ł Ł search for each and every fact in the records of men and nations which will Ł shed light on the questions, social and political, of to-day. The results of this Ł Ł study have been embodicd by Mr. Jones in the books mentioned in the follow- Ł ing notices. We commend them to the careful consideration of every person Ł Ł who would be prepared to meet the crisis now confronting us.

That the Ł church, established by the Saviour himself and Ł fostered by his personal associates should, in Ł so short a time, descend to such depths of in- Ł foxily, is a startling record, and worthy of Ł serious consideration and study. Though Ł covering oft-trodden ground, the matter pre- Ł sented in this volume is new, interesting and Ł valuable. After treating of the Reformation, Ł the scene is transferred to the New World, Ł Ł where the beacon light of liberty, civil and Ł religious, was reared. The closing chapter Ł considers the national apostasy from republican Ł principle of the present day, and its ten- Ł dencies.
