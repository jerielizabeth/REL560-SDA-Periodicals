THE CHURCH-AND-STATE NEGOTIATIONS AT THE VATICAN 497 tamed when the islands were under Spanish sovereignty." Further than this no news of the negotiations has been published, except one very significant dispatch, which we will note later. Just before his departure for Rome Governor Taft wrote an article on the government of the Philippines, which was published in The Outlook of May 31. In this article, among other things, quite a detailed statement was made of the situation in the Philippines as regards the relation of the Catholic Church to the present government. At the conclusion of this statement, a portion of which we will present at another time, the matter of the negotiations with the Vatican was touched upon, and it was stated that such negotiation was made necessary by "the unusual circumstance of a transfer of sovereignty from a government whose interests were almost indissolubly united to the Church, to a government whose interests must be kept separate from the Church." It was stated that in the settle-ment of such questions and differences as now existing between the church and the state, "were we dealing with a secular corporation, it would seem a wiser policy and a more American and direct method of doing business to deal with the chief authority in the corporation rather than with some agent having but limited powers." And so in this matter "the Administration has concluded that the advantage of the direct method and the possibility of settling the differences amicably with the Church by such a method warrant it in running the risk of the unjust criticism that such negotia-tion involves the establishment of diplo-matic relations with the Vatican, and a departure from the traditions of our Government in this regard." And, "in-stead of being a departure from such traditions, such negotiation seems to be an indispensable condition precedent to  the proper separation of the interests of the Church and state in the Philippines." True, "it is possible that the views of the Administration and the views of the Church authorities may be so widely dif-ferent as to the proper course to pursue that other methods of settlement must be found, but it is hoped that the great com-mon interest which the Church and state have in reaching a settlement will lead to such concessions on each side as will make it possible," and "the wise and en-lightened statesmanship which has char-acterized the long and prosperous pon-tificate of Leo XIII. furnishes just ground for this hope." In his address to the Pope on June 5 Governor Taft briefly touched upon the matters which it is desired to settle, and stated that it had seemed wise to settle them "by a conference between the Church and the state ;" that "the separa-tion of all the interests of the Church and the state in the Philippines was absolute-ly necessary under the American Consti-tution ;" that this policy indicated no hostility on the part of the Government toward the Catholic Church or any others, for "the founders of the Ameri-can Government recognized religion as the basis of the morality of its citizens, and worship and religious practises were encouraged and protected even more than in other countries where the separa-tion of church and state did not exist ;" that "the success of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States was an in-dication that it had no reason to fear the extension of the same rule to the Philip-pines." In response, the Pope "expressed his great interest in the American Re-public; his pride and satisfaction with the progress there made by the Catholic Church, and his fervid desire to aid the American Government in every possible way in the successful administration of the Philippines." He assured the com-
