6 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY of any person or power is as unwar-ranted as it is unjust. The Sentinel maintains that its principles, as thus set forth, are strictly in harmony with the original intent of the government of the United States under its Constitu-tion. It was plainly declared by the founders of that government and the framers of that Constitution that " no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United' States;" that "Congress shall make no law respect-ing an establishment of religion, or pro-hibiting the free exercise thereof;" and that "the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion." Therefore in carrying on the work for which it was established The Sentinel is not only a Christian publication, but is in the highest and truest sense a loyal American publication. Strange as it may seem to many peo-ple there was a need and a field in the United States for a publication devoted to the work of maintaining in practise the Christian and American principle of religious liberty and complete sepa-ration of church and state when The Sentinel was established, and that need and field have become greater with every year that has passed since that time. And here we should like to pre-sent briefly the facts and history which would abundantly demonstrate the truth of this, but that must be left until another time. However, to most of the readers of The Sentinel such a resume is hardly necessary. They are thoroughly acquainted with the facts and history to which we refer, and be-ing so acquainted with them, they know that the call for the service which this paper was established to render has been demonstrated by the develop-ments of these eighteen years to have been a very real one, and that that call is as urgent to-day as ever. They know, as was recently stated by a friendly contemporary with regard to  The Sentinel, that "the issue which called this paper into existence is still a living one, and the principles which it advocates ought to be taught to all the people." The establishment of The Sentinel was due to the conviction that there would be brought about in this country general enforcement of the ob-servance, by cessation from labor and business, of the Sunday institution through the revived enforcement of old Sunday laws and the enactment of new ones, and its advocacy of the principles for which it stands has always been and will continue to be with special reference to this particular matter; not that it would not as quickly and as earnestly oppose the violation of those principles in other directions (as it has never failed to do), but because it was and is in this particular matter that it has found and finds most need for their maintenance and advocacy. A short time after the establishment of the pa-per, and for several years thereafter, there were pending national Sunday bills, and for a time it seemed that a national Sunday law was to be enacted. This served to make the issue which the paper was established to meet ap-pear very real and tangible, and to arouse wide spread interest in its work. But (and we believe it was due in no small measure to the work which ≈Å this paper and those connected with it did at the time) none of these measures for the enforcement of Sunday observ-ance by the national government be-came law, and there have been no such measures before Congress since, al-though in the meantime, at the solicitation of the element which backed these measures, Congress has for the first time in its history, and in reversal of the stand taken by it on this very question in the noble and eloquent Sunday mail reports of 1829 and 1830, committed itself in two different acts
