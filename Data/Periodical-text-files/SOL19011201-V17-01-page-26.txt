28 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY. There may be loss in this direction in the future, but The Sentinel of Chris-tian Liberty will continue to be pub-lished until its work is done. But we earnestly solicit the active and energetic co-operation of our friends in securing new subscribers and readers that the magazine may have a wider and wider circulation. The times demand this, and we shall do everything in our power to meet this need. We hope to perfect plans whereby every reader can assist in this work. The PUBLISHERS. The denial of the rights of one means the denial of the rights of all. A reason for Sunday observance is not a reason for Sunday enforcement. The worst enemies of law are those who would perpetuate injustice under the name of law. If Christians would be in the lead in human affairs, they should lead as Chris-tians and not as politicians. A person may be forced into the way of sin, but he cannot possibly be forced into the way of righteousness.

It is not moral, but immoral, to invade the realm of con-science with the power of government. Enforced Sunday rest can have no possible justification except on the hypothesis that Sunday labor is im-moral ; and such labor can be held to be immoral only on the ground that it is irreligious. Therefore Sunday labor can be forbidden only on religious grounds, on the hypothesis that to work on that day is a violation of the divine law. This, however, is a matter of dispute, not only as between Jews and Christians, but between Christians themselves. Therefore this is a question
