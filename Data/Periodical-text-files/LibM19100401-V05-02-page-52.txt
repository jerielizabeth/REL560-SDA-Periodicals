Testimony of a Judge E=0  0 1.1 HRISTIANITY being of a kingdom not of this world, can not be united with that of this world. 111 This is too plain a proposition to be denied, and 1-1 when the church descends to asking civil power to aid in its support there is something dangerously carnal in the purpose.  " The observers of the first day of the week as the Sabbath can ask no more for their religious convictions than can those who observe the seventh day.
