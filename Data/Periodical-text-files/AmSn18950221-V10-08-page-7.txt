PACIFIQt,PRESS, 43 Bond Street, New York City. .:. The Story of .:. pitealrn stand BY ROSALIND AMELIA YOUNG, A Native Daughter. PITCAIRN ISLAND, one of the volcanic gems of the Pacific, has been heard of wherever the English language has been spoken. The story of the working out of the problem of human life on its limited territory Reads stranger and more thrillingly in many respects than a romance. But most if not all of the tales told and books printed have either been too fragmentary, or incorrect and misleading. It will be in-teresting to the friends of that miniature world to know that An Authentic History has been written, and that by a native of the island, one , to the manor born. The title of the new work appears above. It is written by Miss Rosa Young, one of the direct descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty. The book, of 256 pages, is a plain, unvarnished tale of Pit-cairn and its inhabitants from its settlement to the yeaz 1894. It is written with a Charming Simplicity of Style which refreshes the reader and invites a continued peru-sal. This work is illustrated with 26 engravings by the half-tone process, and its 23 chapters have each a neatly engraved heading. PRICE $1.00, POSTPAID.

Governor Fishback's Reply. Reminds the Ministers That Christ Rebuked Over-pure Men. LITTLE ROCK, ARK., Jan. 9.ŠThe City Pastors' Association recently passed resolutions condemning Governor Fishback's published views in regard to the regulation of the social evils. The governor has addressed a lengthy reply to the ministers, in which he says:Š " Intelligent, sensible people, who are at all observant of passing events, will tell you that the chief obstacles in the way of religious and moral progress have been hypocrisy and folly. A few men who arrogate to themselves lead-ership in religious and moral reforms are constantly bringing both into contempt either through hypocrisy or blind fanatical unreason-able folly. There were not wanting men of your type who were ready to pass resolutions against the purity of the Saviour himself, because his honest common sense dared to rebuke certain over-pure men who would have stoned to death a fallen woman."ŠMemphis Commercial.
