MARCH 30, 1893. A_TVIIIECTCA.NT 103 world, the Christian stands in the relation of a ruler, so far as his power of ballot and influence goes. Here he can not control the inward man, but he can justly provide a day of compulsory rest, and do this in the interest both of the indi-vidual and the general welfare. The American Sunday as a legal institution stands on the latter level as a purely secular enactment deriving its authority from the governing power, and all loyal citizens will obey without compulsion. This is one out of many evidences of how the leaven of ambition for the as-sumption of temporal power, is pervading all professed Christendom. The boastful utterances of the prelates of the predom-inant church are being taken up and echoed even by outlying secular news-papers. There is candidly expressed in this editorial a full belief in the propriety of the Christian assuming to stand to the world in the relation of a ruler, who may justly enforce compulsory observance of religious forms upon his neighbor. Such avowals as this show how wide-spread is the acceptance of the doctrine of the righteousness of the gospel of force. CIVIL GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION In English, German, Danish, and Swedish. BY. A.

The length of the approaches, in addition to the tunnel proper, is 5603 feet, making all told a little over two miles.

OF THE CAUCT-POIT (01-EILTEECEIE BY E. J. WAGGONER. History repeats itself, because human nature is the in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the princi-ples of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adop-tion of these principles by prominent men in the church, and the incautious lowering of the standard of pure Christianity, developed the Papacy, which was simply a new phase of pa-ganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY. is alone worth the price of the book.
