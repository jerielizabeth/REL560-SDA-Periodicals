 354 A AlEiFtICAN SENTINEL.               Reverence for Law. Which Is the Safest Course?            "REVERENCE for law" is a very essential thing in good government, but it is not the foundation stone. Reverence for law is not in itself an energizing, puri-fying force in government. Its value in government is not intrinsic, but is conferred by something else. Reverence for law never shook the throne of a des-pot, or broke the shackles from a slave. Reverence for law did not inspire the writing of the Declaration of Independence. If our forefathers had always adhered to the doctrine of reverence for law, the world would never have heard of that Declaration, nor of Magna Charta. The pathway from despotism to liberty in govern-ment has been along the line of revolution, and often squarely across that of reverence for law. Law, in itself, is not entitled to reverence. If it were, then the worst law ever enacted would be entitled to it equally with the best, and the Ł`three worthies" in Baby-lon of old did wrong in not worshiping the golden image. In the Declaration of Independence, our fork lathers took a step from the standpoint of reverence for law, to that of reverence for right. And it was a very long step; it meant revolution. The law of Great Britain said one thing; but right, as they asserted it, said another thing. Right said that human governments were instituted to preserve the una-lienable rights with which all men are endowed by the Creator. From the standpoint of reverence for law this was treason; but in the conflict, right prevailed. Reverence for right is the pole star of good govern-ment. It cannot be lost sight of without a resulting deviation from ;he course which leads to national pros-perity. A person who has no reverence for right, can have no true reverence for anything. All Christian institutions are founded in right, and hence are entitled to reverence, irrespective of any law in their behalf; nor can any such law contribute at all to the reverence felt for them by human beings. But there are religious institutions which have no foundation in right; and it is now sought to secure rev-erence for these from the people by pointing to them as being part of the law of the land. Prominent among these is the institution of Sunday rest. In behalf of this institution very much is said about the necessity of reverence for law; but nothing at all about the necessity of reverence for right. All the right in the case has to be assumed; it does not rest upon evi-dence. Reverence for right is reverence for the higher law of God,Šthat law which says nothing about the first day as a day of rest, but' commands the observance of the seventh day. As against that law, and against the re-quisites of good government, the doctrine of reverence for human law can be of no force at all. HAVING had Washington's advice against the Unitec States ever forming any entangling alliance with Eu ropean or any other foreign power, it will not be amine to set down,°for comparison, the arguments now offered in favor of such alliance and indeed directly against Washington's advice. Then the reader can estimate the relative weight of argument, and wisdom, of the twc courses advised. Hon. Richard Olney, who was attorney general anc secretary of state in President Cleveland's cabinet, writek in the Atlantic Monthly, thus: "The rule of international isolation for America was formulated by Washington, was embalmed in the earnest and solemn periods of the Farewell Address, and has come down to succeeding generations with all the immens( prestige attaching to the injunctions of the Father o his country and of the statesmen and soldiers who having first aided him to free the people of thirteen independent communities, then joined him in the ever greater task of welding the incoherent mass into on( united nation. The Washington rule, in the sense ir which it has been ,commonly understood and actually applied, could hardly have been adhered to more faith fully if it had formed part of the text of the Constitu tion. . . . "What is it that these utterances enjoin us not to doi What rule of abstinence do they lay down for this coon try? The rule is stated with entire explicitness. It is that this country shall not participate in the ordinary vicissi Ludes of European politics, and shall not make a perma nent alliance with any foreign power. It is coupled wit'.  the express declaration that extraordinary emergencies may arise to which the rule does not apply, and that when they do arise temporary alliances with foreign powers may be properly resorted to. Further, not only are proper exceptions to the rule explicitly recognized but its author, with characteristic caution and wisdom carefully limits the field which it covers by bounds which in practice are either accidentally or intentionally disre. garded. "If the Government can do its duty with an ally where it must fail without, and even if it can more seŁ curely and efficiently do that duty with aŁn ally than it can without, it would be not mere folly, but recreancy ae well, not to make the alliance. "If we shall sooner or laterŠand we certainly shallŠshake off the spell of the Washington legend and cease to act the role of a sort of international recluse, it will not follow that former alliances with other nations for per manent or even temporary purposes will soon or often be found expedient. On the other hand, with which of them we shall as a rule practically cooperate cannot be doubtful. From the point of view of our material inter-ests alone, our best friend as well as most formidable foe is that world-wide empire whose navies rule the seas and which on our northern frontier controls a dominion itself imperial in extent and capabilities. There is the same result if we consider the present crying need of our com. mercial interests.  "But our material interests only point in the same direction as" considerations of a higher and less selfish
