We say spiritual things, rather than things religious, because the two are not strictly synonymous. There is much religion that has in it but little spirituality, being a mere form and hav-ing but little influence to transform the life. Over eighteen hundred years ago the apostle Paul, with mind enlightened by the divine Spirit, wrote thus of the very time in which we are now living: " This know also, that in the last days per-ilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthank-ful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, de-spisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away." 2 Tim. 3: 1-5. It is scarcely necessary to do more than quote this scripture to enable any one to recognize at a glance that it is meeting a striking fulfil-ment in our day. Not only the world, but the church, is pleasure mad. A restless spirit is seen everywhere, and never in all history was there a time when so much attention was given to pleasure seeking, and so little comparatively to the study and cultivation of true spirituality. Even our religious worship must be made pleas-ing or attractive by striking features. Good  music, comfortable cushions, and short, sensa-tional sermons are relied upon in most instances to fill the church pews. Even in a popular revival service, novel and sensational features are introduced to attract the crowd. Entering upon the religious life is called " hitting the trail," and about the only thing required of converts is that they promise to quit their meanness, and to meet the preacher in heaven. But little real self-denial is in-sisted upon, and faith in Christ, which is nom-inally held to be essential to salvation, is made to comprehend much or little, according to the personal understanding of those who hear the words used, but without much conception of their real meaning. This is all due to the conditions described in the scripture quoted above. The prevailing spirit being one of pleasure seeking and the church being full of those who are described as " lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God," we could expect nothing else. One way in which this pleasure-seeking spirit is manifested is in growing carelessness in the manner of the observance of the weekly day of rest. Only a few months ago the Sunday law of New York was so amended as to permit base-ball and moving picture shows after 2 o'clock on Sunday afternoon. A movement is now on in Massachusetts to secure a similar amendment to the law of that State. Sunday baseball has also been legalized in Tennessee through a rather technical decision by the supreme court, based evidently upon the demand of the public 88
