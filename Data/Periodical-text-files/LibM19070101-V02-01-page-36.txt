A State What constitutes a state? Not high raised battlements or la- bored mound, Thick walls or moated gate; Not cities proud, with spires and tur- rets crowned, Nor bays and broad arm ports, Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride ; Nor starred and spangled courts, Where low-browed baseness wafts per- fume to pride Š No !Šmen, high-minded men, With powers as far above dull brutes endued, In forest, brake, or den, As beasts excel cold rocks and bram- bles *rude,Š Men, who their duties know, But know their rights; and, knowing, dare maintain, Prevent the long-aimed blow, And crush the tyrant, while they rend the chain,Š These constitute a state. Š Sir William Jones.
