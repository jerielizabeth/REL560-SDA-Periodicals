The above is a picture of the now famous "mission" to the Vatican. It was taken immediately after an audience with the Pope during the late negotiations. This picture, for what it represents, has a tremendous significance that can aardly be realized as yet, but of which the people of the United States and the world will become more and more aware as time proceeds. The United States has not go le to Canossa, but it has taken a long step in that direction. It has shown that it no longer has that prudent jealousy for the maintenance of its strictly secular character and an entire separation between things civil and things ecclesiastical, which so justly distin-guished its early history, and that it has forgotten the real nature of the power that has for fourteen centuries court-ed the nations from the Seven Hills of Rome. It is of ill omen for the world when the great Republic of the West, the classic land of religious and civil liberty, begins to have relations with the Sorceress beside the Tiber√ëwhen it enters upon the pathway which has led other nations to their undoing. Learning the lesson by hard and bitter ex-perience the world at last rebelled against the rule of Rome, and the most noble blossoming of that rebellion has been free, republican America. Alas, and shal,1 it happen unto the nations according to the true proverb, 'The dog is turned to his vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire" 1.?
