Sunday=Law Oppression in Philadelphia Again PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., DECEMBER 31, 1903 NO. 52 Sunday enforcement promotes neither the interests of religion nor of society. "The only way to reduce Sabbath desecration is to begin at home, each and every Christian person (and every other person) to look after himself." "To make a shoe or sell a coat, up to 12 o'clock on Saturday night, is praiseworthy; to do the same thing, one minute later, is a crime under the Sunday lark,. He must be bigoted indeed who dares to claim that the lapse of one minute changes wholesome transactions into crimes, and that twenty-four hours later another minute by the clock restores them to wholesomeness again. Such a burlesque and per'bersion of justice ought not to remain in the sunshine of the twentieth century." It is just as criminal under the Pennsyl2'ania Sunday law to publish nelvspapers, operate street-car lines, and run railroad trains as it is to sell fruit, candy, and cigars. Why should the "worldly business" of the poor and humble be suppressed while that of the rich and powerful is unmolested and even sanctioned and upheld? If the law of 1794 should be enforced against the "worldly busi-ness" of small tradesmen it should be enforced against the "worldly business" of great corporations, and if it is not enforced against the one it should not be enforced against the other. The way in Irhich it is being enforced in Phila-delphia is bald oppression and persecution, and has been rightly termed scandalous and outrageous.
