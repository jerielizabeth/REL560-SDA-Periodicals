39t A,IVIElall CAN TI.NJEiJL VoL. 9. No. 49. NEW YORE, DECEMBER 13, 1894. irfen ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. THE two Seventh-day Adventists re-cently imprisoned in Centreville, Md., for Sunday work, have been released. R. R. Whaley was convicted on three charges, and committed to jail for thirty days on each charge. But it seems that the judge determined, before adjourning court, that he should be imprisoned for only thirty days. He was released on the 3rd inst. W. G. Curlett was convicted on two charges, and was likewise committed to jail for thirty days on each. But he, too, was released in thirty days. The judge was, it seems, more merciful than the law and the complaining witnesses. This action reflects credit on Judge Robinson. It must be exceedingly distasteful to such men to be compelled by an unjust law to lend themselves to what is evidently religious persecution. The remedy is to repeal the law which makes such things possible. WE wish to call special attention to the article on our first page, entitled, " Obey the Law Until Repealed." It an-swers clearly, and we trust, convincingly, a criticism often passed upon those who refuse obedience to Sunday laws. It is strange that Christian men,Šmen with an open Bible in their hands,Šcannot see the vital principle involved in this question of yielding obedience to laws requiring a measure of worship; for " obedience is the highest form of wor-ship." It is said that Sunday laws are civil, not religious; and that they require a civil and not a religious service. But assertion is not proof. The fact is, and it has been admitted by a very large majority of courts and judges, that Sunday laws are religious in this that they rest upon the religious convictions and prejudices of the people, and are designed to guard a reli-gious institution as such; and thus indi-rectly, at least, to guard religion itself. Indeed no other view was ever taken of such laws until under our scheme of com-plete separation of Church and State it became necessary to find a " civil" basis for such legislation. Judge Allen, of New York, holds that the Sunday statute merely recognizes an attribute of holiness already bestowed by a higher law. His exact language is, " It does not detract from the moral or legal sanction of a law of the State, that it con-forms to the kw of God, as that law is recognized by the great majority of the people." A Pennsylvania judge in like  manner declares, " Sabbath-breaking is a violation of a divine as well as a human law." In Arkansas, some Sunday card players were informed by the judge that the day " is set apart by divine appointment" " for other and better engagements." While in Maryland, it has been plainly said, " Ours is a Christian community, and the day set apart as the day of rest is the day consecrated by the resurrection of our Sav-iour." * But it would not matter if every court in the world declared the legally enforced Sunday to be purely civil; the consistent Seventh-day Adventist still could not keep it. It is, the Bible teaches, a rival of God's Sabbath, and as such the man who so believes, must refuse to show it any honor no matter what the consequences to himself may be; prison, the chain-gang, or even death, may await him, but he can-not falter; he must "obey God rather than men." A WELL-AUTHENTICATED story of the barbarous treatment of a Seventh-day Ad-ventist colporter comes to us from Lewis-ville, the county seat of La Fayette County, Arkansas. This colporter, who is employed by the Arkansas Tract Society of Seventh-day Adventists, with headquarters at Van Buren, went to Lewisville and began sell-ing an Adventist book. He called on a Methodist minister, who said to him in substance : " That is the book, is it not, that the Arkansas Methodist condemned recently ?" Upon learning that it was the 'same book, an effort was made to have the colporter arrested, but the town clerk said he had a right to sell the book, which he continued to do. -About 4 o'clock in the afternoon this Seventh-day Adventist colporter was met on the street by a number of men, headed by what proved to be the marshal of the town, who immediately ordered the colporter to leave the town. The officer showed no badge and did not declare himself as an officer. Finally, he caught the poor Seventh-day Advent-ist by the shoulder, and, turning him around, ordered him to leave, and began to assist by kicking him! This was con-tinued for some blocks, when, finally, he grew tired, and, drawing a revolver, he gave the abused colporter fifteen minutes to leave the place. The Adventist went directly to his lodg-ing-place and went to bed, for he had been badly used. About 8 P.M., the marshal came to the room where the victim of his abuse lay, accompanied by a man with a shot-gun. The colporter was again or-dered to leave the place, but he refused to go, saying that he was a citizen of the State and had a perfect right to remain there as long as he conducted himself properly. * Kilgour vs. Mills, 6, G. & J. 268 (1834). The next day the affair was the talk of the town, and the valiant marshal, fearing that he would be prosecuted by the col-porter, went to a justice of the peace and pleaded guilty to assault, and was fined. He was in no danger, however, so far as the poor Seventh-day Adventist was con-cerned, for the colporter did not intend to make complaint, preferring to leave his case in the hands of the Lord. If this had happened to a Methodist colporter in a Roman Catholic country, it would have been religious persecution. But what is it since the victim is an Adventist, and the assailants so-called Protestants ? AMERICAN SENTINEL. Set for the defense of liberty of conscience, and therefore uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward a union of church and State, either in name or in fact.

THE Leader, of Dayton, Rhea County, Tenn., is authority for the statement that at the recent term of the circuit court for that county, the grand jury found 116 indictments, 20 of which were against Seventh-day Adventists, charging them with nuisance by working on Sunday. Commenting upon the facts the Leader says :Š These indictments which persecute people on ac-count of their religion are the outcome of personal malice and not of any honest desire to see the Sabbath day kept holy. Why, one of the leading spirits in these persecutions would not, of his own practical knowledge, recognize a religiously observed Sunday if he met it on the road. Of course they burned witches at the stake in Massa-chusetts one hundred years ago, and if the Blue Laws of our ancestors are to be revived in Rhea County, let us have no partiality in the malicious jamboree. If the Seventh-day Adventists are desolating the county be-cause they do a few chores on Sunday, what about the -five hundred men who work for the Dayton Coal and Iron Company on the same sacred day ? It is as much of a crime for one class of citizens to work on Sunday as it is for the other, but with this difference in favor of the Adventists---their religion does not recognize the sanctity of our Sabbath. Prosecuting Attorney Fletcher has instructed the clerk to issue no fee certificates to the man who is prosecuting the Adventists, and he has relinquished all his own fees on the indictments, which shows a commendable spirit. But the proper caper for Judge Parks and Attorney-general Fletcher to do is to kick those indictments out of court, and put an end to the personal malice persecutions of some of the best citi-zens of Rhea County. Ł Our courts ought not to be vehicles for gratifying private spite. It is said that Professor Colcord and other teachers in the academy at Grays-ville are among the number indicted. The Leader deserves credit for its fearless de-nunciation of such persecution. It is, however, an error to say that witches were burned in Massachusetts. Witches were hanged, but never burned in this . country. tt 100 to 249 " 250 to 499  500 to 999 '. 64 tl
