But, as he had been the head of the heathen priesthood, it seemed to him right that he should make himself equally the head of the Christian priest-hood. He, therefore, assumed a supreme jurisdiction over the clergy. One of the earliest objects of his policy was to dimin-ish the independence of the church; for which purpose he received it into strict alliance with the state; and com-bined in his own person the highest ecclesiastic d with the highest civil authority. The entire control of the external administration of the church he assumed to himself He regulated everything respecting its outward discipline; the final decision of religious controversies was subjected to the discretion of judges appointed by him; and no general council could be called except by his au-thority. Though he permitted the church to remain a body politic distinct from that of the state, yet he as-sumed to himself the supreme power over this sacred body, and the right of modeling and of governing it in such a manner as should be most conducive to the public good. Thus he exercised at once a supremacy over the heathen and the Christian priesthoods. He was the chief pontiff of heathenism, and the chief bishop of the Christian church. And this state episcopate he exercised many years before he was baptized; and long before he was a member of the church he was its summus episco-pus; and only a few days before his death received from Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, the ceremony of baptism. The Holy Spirit and Sunday.ŠNo. 9. BY C. H. KESLAKE. PROTESTANTISM can never die. It is essentially a protest against the papacy and its arrogant, its blas-phemous, claims. Being a protest against the papacy, it must be that so long as that power shall exist, so long must Protestantism continue, and eventually gloriously triumph. The principle for which Protestantism stands is the Bible as the only standard of faith and morals; Whereas the principle for which Catholicism stands, is the Bibl and traditionŠwith tradition the more clear and safe. It is no argument against the Protestant idea, as set forth above, to say that from its beginning in the sixteenth century it has not always been consistent with its profession, inasmuch as it has taught much that is not to be found in Scripture; while, on the other hand, it has failed to teach much that is revealed in the divine Word. Beginning with the principle that the Bible alone is the standard of faith and morals, ProtestantismŠcon-sistent ProtestantismŠsimply holds itself ready to re-nounce error on the one hand, and to teach the truth as contained in the Word of God on the other. It in no wise militates against Protestants for the true Protestant to acknowledge that while contending for the Protestant principle, there were some things held to which were not consistent with the principle HEAL He does not claim that he knows all that the Bible teaches. He simply knows that that Word is spirit and life (John 6:63); that the "Word of God is not bound" (2 Tim.2:9 ); that the opening of the Word giveth light (Ps. 119:30). And, therefore, as that WOrd continues to open, and give understanding to the simple, it will simply expose error by revealing the truth. And when such is the case, the error is gladly renounced, while the truth takes its place. This blessed work must go on until the believer is completely delivered from error, and the point reached when all he knows will be nothing but the truth; and the last vestige of error being removed, there will be nothing left, but for the Word to continue to open, and through endless ages, truth after truth be revealed. It is possible for the professed Protestant to stop short and come to a point where, for various reasons, he will refuse to yield up error for truth. But that matters not so far as Protestantism is concerned. It will simply go on and leave him hopelessly in the rear; and he would then become a Protestant only in name. As we have already seen in previous articles, when Protestantism began there was retained as an article of faith that which was not to be found in the Bible, but which was acknowledged to exist solely by the authority of the (Catholic) churchŠnamely, the Sunday. Stultify-ing though it was, and a matter much to be regretted, it did not prove the Protestant principle wrong. Not being fully understood then, it could only be a matter of time when it would be understood, and the Sunday institution be repudiated by every true Protestant. Nor is this all. The reader who has followed us in the investigation of this subject will have seen that when the Protestant principle came up and the General Coun-cil of Trent was convoked to meet the "heresy," it was met right on this question of Sunday. So far as the Catholic Church was concerned, tradi-tion prevailed, resting its claim for recognition solely upon the Sunday institution. Sunday, therefore, was the test. That being so, and inasmuch as Protestants them-selves at the Council of Augsburg had conceded as valid the church's claim with reference to the Sunday, it was clearly a victory for-  the Catholic Church. But it did not prove, however, that the principle contended for by Protestants was wrong. It must be acknowledged that the Protestants stultified themselves; but the doctrine that the Bible alone is the only standard of faith and morals, is eternally true. Now as Sunday was the test at the beginning of the Reformation; as the Catholic doctrine of tradition was sustained in the Council of Trent by the fact of the exist-ence of Sunday; as Protestants had stultified themselves
