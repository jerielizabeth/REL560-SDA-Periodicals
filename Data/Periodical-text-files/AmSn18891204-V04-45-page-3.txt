TI-18 AmEtzteAm SENTINEL. 355 edged sword. Fanaticism begets fanaticism. What if, their beliefs being established and en-trenched by law, there should sweep back in this republic, as once in France, against ecclesiastical oppression, the tides of unbelief, and the Goddess of Reason should sit crowned in the Capitol? What if, invoking their example, the infidel and agnostic should establish a government of the negation of God, and visit their faiths with their own intolerance ?ŠIn that bitter hour they would recall the sacred teachings of the fathers of this nation, and the countenance of Liberty would glow with a divine radiance only in the moment when it was lost. Since the beginnings of man the features of the Absolute have been veiled. Standing between two worlds, with instincts beyond life, and hopes beyond death, from this "bank and shoal of time," man has looked with straining eyes towards the UnseenŠattempting. to illumine with his frail candle of reason the halls of the Eternal. Afflicted by sorrows, he has awaited in all times and all lands the' merciful justice of the Un-known. With moan and tears he has in many a' name and tongue formulated in creeds his measure of the Infinite. Every faith that has given courage to our kind has been held sacred by its worshiperi". Every doubt, to the eye of Mercy is yet more sacred than faith, for it gropes in suffering. For the struggling tides of men,Šfellow-workers and pilgrims on this mist-ridden shore,Šthe wisdom that remains for this world is charityŠthe doctrine out of NazarethŠthe creed of love to all mankind. On American soil, a century ago, by the guidance of history and the inspiration of the Great, we built for the hope of the world the political monument of this sublime creed. Under its impartial shadow the worshipers of Truth, whether in church, or wood, or mosque, or synagogue, or temple, have known no discrimination for opinion. Let it be the oath of Americans to guard that monument for-ever. An Appeal to the W. C. T. U. TirE W. C. T. U. have a column in the Healds-burg Enterprise. In the issue of that journal of July 3 they have an article entitled, "Sabbath Observance." They speak of the efforts put forth for the Blair Sunday-Rest bill; and all the re-sults thus far, they say, are God's answers- to ,their prayers. That is, they would have us be-lieve that the Lord answered prayer in behalf of an unscriptural method to obtain an arbitrary law to compel observance to an institution which not only has no divine authority, but which is a rival to the sacred rest:day of God's own appoint- ment ! Sisters; just think of that, will you? Is it not possible that you may be wrong in ascribing the result to your prayers? God heareth those who ask according to his will (1 John 5:14); but did you ask according to God's will? Where is it contained in God',s will that Sunday should be observed? Where is it revealed that any relig-ious institution of any character should be forced upon the conscience of anyone, whatever his be-lief or unbelief? Paul said, "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." 2 Cor. 5:11. You think, sisters, that the judgments of God will fall upon this people because of their violation of God's law; your brothers of National Reform so talk. Believing, therefore, in the terror of the Lord, why do you not take the scriptural way, and persuade men? Is it be- cause you lack the other means, which gives power to persuasion,---the word of God with its precepts and promises? Be honest, sisters, with your own souls ; why support unscriptural insti-tutions and in such unscriptural ways? They continue :Š " Opposition to this Sunday-Rest bill comes mainly from two sources : The liquor dealers and the Sev-enth-day Baptists and Adventists, the first class op-posing it as an infringement of personal liberty, the second as an infringement of conscience. We shall now spend no time on the first class, both because their opposition is nothing like as pronounced as that of the seventh-day people, and because the personal liberty plea has been so often and so ably answered in another connection. "The second class of opponents are entitled to most respectful consideration, both because we always respect conscientious scruples, and because of the per-sistent, concentrated efforts they are making to de-feat the bill. It seems as if those two churches which believe that Saturday is the true Sunday are bending all the energies which other churches ex-pend in home and foreign missions, in Christian philanthropy of every kind, upon the one effort of defeating the Sunday-Rest bill. The country is flooded with their literature, on which they expended twenty thousand dollars last year, and their strong-est men and women are instant in season and out of season, defending their cause. It is a significant fact that in this opposition of our seventh-day friends the Jews take no part." On the above we wish to offer a few observa-tions which we hope may prove a benefit to our W. C. T. U. sisters. 1. They acknowledge that theŁ great opposer to the present fight of this woman's temperance or-ganization is not the runi power, but two bodies of temperate and temperance ChristiansŠand these must submit or be crushed. Is it for this purpose the Union was organized ? How sadly fallen! 2. Seventh-day people do not believe that "Saturday is the true Sunday." But Saturday is the true Sabbath. They have no more claims for Sunday than any other day. Its name indi- cates its origin as a day for religious observance. 3. The Seventh-day Adventist Church (and we doubt not the Seventh-day Baptist ChurchŠwe speak for the former) put more energy and more money in foreign missions last year than ever before. It can safely be said that they did more work in this directiop in proportion to their wealth and numbers than any denomination that espoused the cause of the Blair Sunday-Rest bill. All their efforts against it were extra above their regular work. 4. Yes; they probably expended more than twenty thousand dollars. Why not? Was not their cause a worthy one? We praise God that they did so much. We wish they could have done more. 5. "Their strongest men and women are in-stant in season and out of season, defending their cause." Then they are doing just what God commanded that the minister of the word should do. But they advised no arbitrary methods ; they demanded nothing from the State them-selves; they only asked that equality before the law which the Federal Government grants. They contended not for privileges, but rights,Šrights for all equally with themselves. Was this the principle upon which our sisters strove? 6. The Jews did take part in this opposition..  Both the Jewish Exponent and the Jewish Times and Observer had forcible articles against the proposed bill. 7. Our sisters belong to a "Christian" organ-ization. They profess to be Christians, that is,  followers of Christ, obedient to his precepts. Did they ever read -the following precept? ' "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12. This does not mean Methodist men; nor Bap-tist men, nor Prohibitionists; it means all menŠJews and Gentiles, believers and unbelievers,,  Christians and pagans, Sabbath-keepers and SunŁ -day-keepers. Would you haVe the pagan compel you to adore his gods and keep his sacred days?' --Then force upon him yours. Would you have, the infidel compel you to forego all worship, all service to God?ŠThen compel him to honorŁ your religious observances. Would you be com-pelled to observe the seventh-day Sabbath, the true Lord's day? (Would God that you rcon-sciences, enlightened by the word and Spirit, would so compel.) Then force upon the seventh-day-keeper your high day, contrary to his con-science and welfare. Are the Christian women of your organization prepared to interpret the "golden rule" in this, way ? Are you prepared to be active agents in the oppressive measures which are being pushed! forward under the name Christian, by profess-edly Christian men ? The tyranny of the Dark Ages began with milder and more plausible claims than are now made by those clamoring for a religo-civil sabbath. The sure effect of such legislation will be to make hypocrites of many who prize temporal advantage and convenience above conscience, and oppress others who regard conscience and the word of God above all earthly advantages. Christians, indeed, do not, look here for results or rewards. Are the W. C. T. U. prepared to meet their present work in the light of the judgment?ŠSigns of the Times. Religion and the Majority. THE following editorial article from the St., Louis Republican is worthy of a careful reading,. as it contains much food for serious reflection :Š "In his essay on The Policy of the Massa-, chusetts Colonists towards Quakers and Other Dissenters,' Mr. Henry L. Southwick, of Bos-ton, states', with the precision of a lover of histor-ical truth, facts that will never cease to have a. contemporaneous interest while there remains a. possibility of oppression through public opinion. expressed in legislative enactment. These facts have been often examined. It is well enough.  known that very soon after landing on Plymouth Rock the `Pilgrims' banished John and Israel Brown for being Episcopalians; that they drove out Roger Williams, elder of Salem church, for declaring 'the new and dangerous doctrine' that the magistrates should restrain crimes and not control opinions ; ' that Mrs. Hutchinson was also banished for a similar offense of dissent; that when the Baptists proclaimed that Christians ought to tolerate Christians,' Obadiah Holmes was whipped for the heresy; that Clark, Cran-dall, Gorten, and many others, were fined or ban-ished ; that under the general acts against Quak-ers they were to be arrested on their entrance to the colony, committed to the house of correc-tion,' severely whipped,' kept constantly at work, and none suffered to converse or speak with them during their imprisonment;' that under a still severer law, every Quaker returning from banishment should, for the first offense, suffer the loss of one ear ; for the second offense, the loss of the other ear, and for the third offense, have his tongue bored through with a hot iron ; '
