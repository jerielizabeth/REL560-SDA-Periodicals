At the same meeting a proposition was made by the Providence Association to unite with the Olneyville Association that these measures might be carried out. November 2nd, another meeting was held and reported by the same paper, which says :- The matter of Sunday closing was discussed. The committee reported that one shop on Plainfield Street was open on the Sabbath, and that a com-plaint had been entered with the town sergeant. The committee stated that the town sergeant was slow, and they proposed to do something to expe-dite the closing of this store. By this report we see that the association is carrying out its plans of watching, and entering complaints against those who still- open theirŁ  shops on Sunday. More-over, because the town sergeant was a little slow to carry out their wishes in en-forcing the Sunday closing law, they pro-. pose to hurry up the town sergeant, or, perhaps, boycott him at the next election. By this we see that oppression and selfishness are constantly increasing, and the words of Paul in 2 Tim. 3 : 1-5, are being fast fulfilled : " This know also, that in the last days' perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers," etc. Cannot all see by the signs of the times that we are in the last days,and that perils are thickening all around us ? Are we ready to meet the Lord when he shall appear to gather his jewels ? 11. J. FARMAN. SOME VALUABLE BOOKS FOR YOUNG MEN. We have secured the following books which we can recommend, not only as unobjectionable but as highly beneficial reading for young men :- Moral 11Iuscle and How to Use It, by FRED-ERICK ATKINS. A Brotherly Chat with Young Men. "This is positively the best book for young men that we have seen. It looks the facts of young men's lives full in the face, and proclaims the gospel of industry, perseverance, self-con-trol, and manly Christianity. We can certify that no one will find it stupid."-St. Andrews Cross. First Battles and How to Fight Them, by F. A. ATKINS. Friendly Chats with Young Men. "It is true in substance, attractive in its style, and admira-ble in its spirit. I heartily commend this little volume."-Rev. John Hall. D.D. The Spiritual Athlete and How He Trains, by W. A. BODELL. Introduction by REV. B. FAY MILLS. A work for young men, pithy, pointed and practical. "Its power and value lie in the consistent carrying out of the comparison between physical and spiritual training."-The Independent. Brave and True, by J. THAIN DAVIDSON. Talks to Young Men. "This is one of the books the wide distribution of which cannot be too greatly desired."-Presbyterian Journal. Each of these books is complete in itself, and so can be sold separately at fifty cents each; but. as they are all about equally good, and desiring to encourage the dissemination of such literature, we offer the four for $1.75. They are all bound alike, and put up in a neat box present a very at-tractive appearance. They will form a valuable addition to any young man's or youth's library. PACIFIC PRESS PUB.

WE wish to call especial attention to the above important publication. It is now undergoing thorough revision as rapidly as is consistent with thoroughness and other circumstances. Some of the last numbers issued and about to be issued are as follows:- Who Changed the Sabbath? No. 107. This is the old title of a new and much better tract. It should be circulated everywhere. It shows by the Scripture who did not change and who would seek to change the day, and it confirms the Scripture testimony by Roman Catholic and Protestant witnesses. Price 3 cents. Life, Its Source and Purpose. No. 108. This is a ten-cent pamphlet by Elder Wm. Covert, on the positive side of the life question. It shows how we may obtain life in Christ Jesus our Lord. The last chapter, and there are nine in the little work, is worth the price of the pamphlet. Price 10 cents. Tormented Forever and Ever; Or God's Test of Immortality, No. Ill. This tract of 16 pages treats on the fearful fate of the wicked, as shown by such texts as Rev. 14: 11; 20:10; 19: 3; Matt. 25: 41. 46; Mark 9:43-48, and others, in a new and reasonable light. Read and circulate. Price 2 cents. Spiritualism: Its Source and Character. No. 112. This tract contains all that is worth preserving in Nos. 12 and 13, and more. It is both of these 32-page tracts combined in one 24 page, and is worthy of a wide circulation. Price 3 cents. The Christian Sabbath. FROM A ROMAN CATHOLIC STANDPOINT. No. 113. This is the reprint, by importunate request, of the articles in the Catholic Mirror which have recently ap-peared in the American Sentinel. It shows very conclusively the inconsistency of Protestants in holding to Sunday as a Bible Sabbath, and that while professing to go by the Bible and the Bible alone, they are following the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church. Price 4 cents, The Identical Seventh Day. No. 114. There are three stock objections brought against the Sabbath: (1) THE Roux]) WORLD, (2) THE QUESTION OF LosT TIME, and (3) Tau SEVENTH PART OF TIME. These ques-tions have hitherto been considered in three tracts, Nos. 7, 21, and 39, aggregating 64 pp. These three numbers are now discontinued, and these questions are treated clearly in a tract of 16 pages. All essential arguments are given in No. 114, " The Identical Seventh Day." Price 2 cents. The Waymarks to the Holy City. An Exposition of Daniel 7. No. 115. Ł This is a revision of what was once No. 5. But as it needed revision, and as the former title was to some extent a misnomer, it has been revised and issued under the above number. Price 2 cents. The First Number for drannary, 1894, is The Sabbath-school Lessons on, Luke. No. 116. There will be one year's lessons on this book, and each quarter's lessons should be preserved. Price 5 cents. Prophetic Lights. (January, Extra.) No. 117. This is that most worthy little work written by Elder E. J. Waggoner some years ago. It is just the book for circulation among those who know not the truth. It is finely illustrated, and is issued as a number of the Library at 50 cents. Christ Tempted as We Are. No. 118. By Mrs. E. G. White. This is a most precious, comforting, and strengthening number. Price 2 cents. Order by number. Address, PACIFIC PRESS, Oakland, Cal., or 43 Bond Street, New York.
