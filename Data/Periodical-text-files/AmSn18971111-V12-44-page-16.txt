Large Type S. S. Teachers' SELF=PRONOUNCING COMBINATION BIBLE. MARK Containingthe King James and the Revised Versions on the Same Page. Showing in Simple Form all Changes, Additions and Omissions, and Enabling all Readers to See at a Glance wherein the Two Versions Differ. Both Versions Combined Without Duplicating. The King James Version, set in full and conforming exactly to the Oxford Teachers' Edition, and, wherever a change occurs, the letters r. v., referring to a foot-note at the bottom of the page, showing the reading as it appears in the Revised Version. Thus, in the same book, we have both the King James and the Revised Versions complete and intact, without materially increasing the size of the volume or reducing the size of the type. Both printed together in the same column, showing the diferences at a glance, and enabling the reader to "ractically read both at one and the same time; or, in other words, consuming in the comparative reading of the two texts not more than one-half the time required in the old way. EITHER VERSION ALONE OR BOTH TOGETHER. The great point 'of excellence in this arrangement is that while it enables one to read both Versions in almost exactly the same time, it does not mar, or in any way hinder, the reading of the King . James Version alone and independently, where one does not care to refer to the revisions. How to Read the Combination Bible. Below is part of page 6o8 of our Combination Bible. The following Key shows how it is to be read : KEYŠThe first RT on page 6o8 appears in verse 37 of the 9th chapter, before "domin-ion." In the King James Version the reading is " dominion over our bodies," etc. By referring to the foot-notes it will be seen that the word " dominion " is changed to "power." Hence the Revised Version reads " power over our bodies," etc. In the 38th verse the King James reads, "because of all this ; " by reference to foot of page it will be seen that the Revised Version reads, " yet for all this." In verse 28 there is an RO, which denotes an omission. Refer to the foot-notes and " (having)" will be found. Every omission is placed in a parenthesis in the foot-notes, and the Revised Version in this instance reads, "every one that had knowledge and understanding." Thus it is seen that the Revised Version is easily read in connection with the King James Version. The system is so simple and so easily understood that no reader finds any difficulty in comparing one version with the other. Specimen of Type used in the S. S. Teachers' Combination Bible.
