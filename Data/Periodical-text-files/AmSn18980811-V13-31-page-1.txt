   a IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT.ﬂ--Jesus Christ.   VOLUME 13. NEW YORK, AUGUST 11, 1898. NUMBER 31.          HOW THE SUNDAY LAW AIMS TO GIVE LIBERTY TO THE WORKINGMAN,       IT is a warm Sunday morning, and the workingman, with his family, are taking what comfort they can within the confines of their own premises. They would like to go outside to some place of recreation; but a strict Sunday-law rdgime has been put in force, which has suppressed all Sunday trains and prohibited all "worldly" amusements on the "Sabbath" day. Entrance to the public pleasure grounds is barred, and the policeman stands ready to resist any attempted violation of the law; while the clergyman stands by and suggests to the workingman that there is one pathway open to himŠthat leading to church. He has no business, says the clergyman, to want to go anywhere else on Sunday. But the workingman does not care to go to church, because, as he says, there is so much preaching of political and war issues, and so little of the gospel. It may be said that worldly recreations are not yet prohibited on Sunday, but it is at this that the agitators for Sunday enforcement aim, for they no more approve of Sunday amusements than of Sunday work; and there is no logical stopping place for the law this side of it. Jr God drew people towards himself by the chains of law instead of the "cords of love," everybody would be trying to get away from him. THE more religion there is embodied in legislation, the more people will there be who despise religion; for no person wants religion forced upon him. THERE is in the human heart a natural love of free-dom, a natural aversion to arbitrary restraint. A tired laborer, let us suppose, comes to his room and lies down upon his couch to rest. Leave him at lib-erty to lie there or get up as he chooses, and he will re-main quiet in the enjoyment of refreshing rest; but strap him to the couch, and though he is in no pain he will do his utmost to get up from the couch at once.
