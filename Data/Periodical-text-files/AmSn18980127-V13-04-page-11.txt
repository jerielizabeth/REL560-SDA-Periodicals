AMERICAN SENTINEL. 59 A Kingdom of Perfect Liberty. Two boys, Walter Mills and Henry Courtney, sat on the bank of the river's dry bed one bright afternoon in October. They were the sons of thrifty farmers, and had worked hard and diligently during the busy months of sowing and reaping. Now they have enjoyed a day's vacation in the woods, gathering the fast falling nuts. Their sacks were well filled, and they were now content to stop and rest awhile. The autumn leaves in gorgeous hues came floating down on the balmy air. The atmos-phere and surroundings were such as to give birth to serious thought. There was a calm, and the boys silently meditated. "Say, Henry," said Walter, "do you think these leaves would ever have fallen here to die, or this river ever have gone dry, or the meadows ever have been so brown, if man had never sinned?" This was a long question for a boy to ask, or for a boy to answer. "No," he replied, in a manner that showed he was thinking along the same line; "nor I don't think we should see so many ugly things in nature; for the Bible says that God made everything 'good' and `perfect."' "Yes, everything must have been just glorious when God first created the earth and made Eden as the home of Adam and Eve," said Walter, his face brightening 'with thoughts of the beauty of the "garden of God." "I tell you, Henry, I wish God had never allowed Adam and Eve to sin, and then had to curse the ground with thorns and thistles and briers to cause man to work for his bread so that he would not have so much time to indulge in evil. Why didn't God keep them from eating that forbidden fruit, or else never have put such a tree in the garden to tempt them? or why did he let Satan go down to that beautiful garden after being cast out of heaven? Doesn't the Bible say that God knows all things, and understands our 'thought afar off,' or something like that? Then, why did he not keep this flood of evil from the world, when he had the power to do it?" Both boys were thinking fast, and they were getting into deep and untried waters. But they were the sons of Christian parents who had taught them the principles of the gospel in the home, and had always kept them in the Sabbath-school where many a fact had been stored in  their minds for future use. These facts were now coming together in such a way as to help them out of the diffi-culty. A short silence followed which was broken by Walter. "But God doesn't compel dny of us to keep his law, does he? He doesn't force any of his creatures to do his will. Don't you think that we, and all the heavenly be-ings, too, love him more because he is not arbitrary with any of his subjects?" "Yes; 'God is love,'" replied Henry, studiously. "He is not a tyrant as Satan has caused some people to be-lieve. Think what it has cost God, the Father, and all heaven, to allow to all.the liberty to choose good or evil. God had to give up his only begotten Son, and the angels their beloved Commander. Then they must see him in the form of sinful man, endure the cruel mocking and scourging, and be rejected by his own people whom he had created and chosen. And all this was done, too, with the power that came from God. John 19:11. And God knew all the while that this must take place in order save man, didn't he? "Now, do you remember that memory verse we had in Sabbath-school a short time ago?Å the one which says, `Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you' ? What a great God of liberty our heavenly Father is, and what a wonderful lesson of liberty he is giving to the universe, and to this world!" "Yes; it is truly wonderful," said Henry, "and, after all, I'm glad that God did let Adam choose right or wrong, as he desired; for now I can see more than ever that 'God is love.' And this world would be happier and better if every one in it would follow the example of our Creator. Only the other day I heard father reading of a man who was arrested and put in prison for working quietly on Sunday after he had conscientiously observed the Sabbath. And while the man was in prison, his wife and children suffered for the necessaries of life. I'm sure now that this trying -to compel people to be good or make them good by law, is all wrong. I hope we shall never be led in any way to trample upon the rights of others, or interfere with man's duty to God." "Yes, and, Henry, perhaps we can put these princi-ples in practice even now. We often see the rights of others trampled under foot. Let us watch for the oppor-tunity with our associates." The setting sun witnessed these happy sons of America return to their homes to take up the stern duties of life with broader ideas of its sacred responsibilities. They now saw that they were honored by the Creator with lib-erty to make their own choice; and they sought to choose the ways of him who gave up his life rather than take away the right of choice from one of his subjects. The God of liberty would have all in the universe enjoy the same liberty that he enjoys, even though it took the life of his Son. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." E. W. CAREY.
