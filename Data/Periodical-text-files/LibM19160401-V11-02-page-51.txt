++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + + + + Ł Ł Ł  Memorial and Petition 4. From page 4349 of the " Congressional Record " of March 9, 1916. + 4. f + Mr. Poindexter: I present a memorial of the Religious Liberty Association of Seventh-day +f + Adventists respecting certain legislation. I ask that it be printed in the " Record." + 4. + 4. There being no objection, the memorial was ordered to lie on the table and to be printed 4. + in the " Record," as follows: Š + + 4. + To the honorable the Senate of the United States in Congress: Š + + The memorial, representation, and petition of the Religious Liberty Association of Seventh- + + day Adventists, headquarters in District or Columbia, respectfully represents: Š + + Whereas, through a misunderstanaing, we were given no opportunity to present before the + + Senate Committee on the District of Columbia our objections to Senate Bill 64a, a bill imposing + + compulsory Sunday observance upon one special class In workers, we theretore take this means of + + bringing to your attention several very important reasons why the proposed bill should not be + 4. enacted into law : Š + + First. The proposed bill penalizes work done on one day of the week by one class of work- + + era only. Therefore this is clearly Class legislation, and as such is unjust and obnoxious and + + should not be passed by Congress. The Illinois Supreme Court decision on this point is worthy + + of your consideration: Š + + " How, it may be asked, is the health, comfort, safety, or welfare of society to be injuriously + + affected by keeping open a barber shop on Sunday? It is a matter of common observation that + + the barber business as carried on in this State [Illinois] is both quiet and orderly. . ... More- + + over, if the merchant, the grocer, the butcher, the druggist, and those engaged in other trades and + + callings are allowed to open their places of business and carry on their respective avocations + + during seven days of the week, upon what principle can it be held that a person who may be + + engaged in the business of barbering may not do the same thing? Why should a discrimination + + be made against that calling and that alone? " (Ill. Repts., 161, pp. 296-309.) + + Secondly, this bill if enacted, would serve as a precedent for further legislation of a kind + + never yet enacted by Congress. It would serve to open the door for a flood of religious legisla- + + tion to follow. It is the first attempt by Congress to penalize honest secular work done on a day + + + considered sacred by most Christians. +  + Previous Sunday legislation has had the purpose not to penalize honorable work but to make +  + it possible for those who desired to observe Sunday to do so, by not requiring them to work on +  + that day. This is the evident purpose in regulations freeing government employees from working + + on Sunday. In some places legislation has been passed such as to make Sunday work by United + 4. States revenue officers unnecessary. The closing of courts and Congress on Sunday is of a similar + * nature. If a local postmaster in a community desiring the post office open on Sunday complies + with the popular demand he is not subject to punishment. If Congress desires to hold sessions + 4. on Sunday, such an act is neither prohibited nor penalized. + + Sunday-closing bills of a temporary nature have been passed concerning government exhibits +  + in expositions held in certain States out of a deference to local State laws where the exhibitions + + were held. This is very clear from the fact that at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in California, + + + where there are no Sunday laws in the State, the government exhibits were not closed on that day. + By the proposed legislation Congress would exceed its powers, according to the Senate Com- + + mittee report of Jan. 19, 1829, when a similar question was before the Senate. The position + + taken in that report was as follows: " The proper object of government is to protect all persons +  + in the enjoyment of their religious as well as civil rights, and not to determine for any whether + + + they shall esteem one day above another or esteem all days alike holy."Š" American State Pa-+ * pers," Class VII, p. 225 et seq. + Hundreds of Seventh-day Adventists have been mercilessly persecuted in the past by being  + I penalized and made to serve in jails and chain gangs because they dared to worship God in har- mony with the requirements of the fourth commandment of the decalogue. There are five indict- + ments of Seventh-day Adventists now pending before the courts in Tennessee and two in Okla- + homa for work that was done on Sunday in private and inside of their own premises and to the + physical disturbance of no one. Some people are easily disturbed mentally and religiously when + + 4. they see some practicing a dissenting religion. We had hoped that this kind of legislation might + Iremain a relic of the colonial days when there was a union of church and state. We agree with the official organ of the Knights of Labor Š the " Journal "Š that " Any + proposition to pass Sunday legislation in the District of Columbia is a direct violation of the + Constitution, against the spirit of our institutions, and against the policy heretofore maintained + by the federal government" f We therefore earnestly protest on grounds of sound American principles against the coin- - + in + + pulsory Sunday observance bill for barbers (S. 645) as being class legislation, unjust, unconsti- + I tutional, partial, religious, and as the first example of a Congressional bill to penalize honest and honorable labor done on one specific day of the week, thereby leaving only five working days f in the week to any one keeping another day for religious reasons. 4. If Congress has the right to close barber shops on Sunday, irrespective of dissenting reli- + gious convictions, then it can close schools, sanitariums, publishing houses, etc., where secular + 4 duties are performed on Sunday, and thus compel those who observe another day to surrender 4. two days each week. We cannot consent to this abridgment of our rights to the free exercise of + religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the federal Constitution, hence this memorial 4. and petition to each Senator pleading for the preservation of our Constitutional rights, as well as 4. those of all the citizens of these United States, earnestly praying, as we are in duty bound, that + the Supreme Lawgiver of the universe, by illuminating those to whom it is addressed, may, on + the one hand, turn their counsels from every act which would affront his divine prerogative or  + i violate the trust committed to themŁ and on the other hand, guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his blessing, redound to their own praise, and establish more firmly the lib- + erties, the prosperity, and the happiness of all the citizens of our favored republic. And we beg + leave to assure you that however earnestly we may contend for the preservation of the free exer- + cise of our religion from the chains and shackles of human authority and the demands of those + making opposing claims for spiritual domination by civil powers, we are nevertheless disposed + + 4. zealously to support the government of our country and to render a proper and due submission + to the lawful exercise of its authority in civil matters. Signed by the national secretary of the Religious Liberty Association of Seventh-day Advent- + fists; headquarters, Takoma Park, Washington, D. C. C. S.
