This unique and striking picture gives a view of President Roosevelt's Cab inet as it stands to-day. This Cabinet and the Supreme Court are the two highest official bodies in the United States. With Congress, they represent the three branches of the national government, the legislative, the executive, and the Judicial. The circular figure at the left is the _Great Seal of the United States, on the reverse of which is the Latin inscription, " Novas Ordo Seculorum," meaning, "A New Order of Things." Only the President and the members of his cabinet have the right to use this Seal.
