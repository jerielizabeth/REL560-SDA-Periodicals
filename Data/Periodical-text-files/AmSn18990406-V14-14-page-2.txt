210 AMERICAN SENTINEL. construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people," and, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Great power was centered by the people only in the Federal Government, over which the people were to ex-ercise control at the general elections; and this power was fenced about by safeguards in the Federal Constitu-tion. But in the Trusts a power of vast dimensions arises which is not centered in any organization subject to change by a popular vote, or in any way to the control of the people. This disturbs the balance of power just as certainly and as harmfully as though power to a like extent had been usurped by the Government itself. By the Constitution extraordinary power is put in the hands of a few persons chosen by the people and sub-ject to their control. By the Trusts extraordinary power is placed in the hands of a few persons not chosen by the people, and subject to no authority but them-selves. Whether these Trust-crowned monarchs c in be made subject to the popular will or notŠwhether, in other words, they have power under the people or above the peopleŠis a question that is now before the courts for decision. The Trusts defy the power of both state and national courts alike, and thus far have done so success-fully. The attorney-general of the United States, has re-cently declared that the Federal courts have no power to deal with "any combination constituting a restraint and monopoly of trade unless such trade is what is known as interstate or international trade and com-merce." But by the provisions of the Constitution, each State in the Union is compelled to receive the products of every other State, and permit the sale of the same within its borders; so that the products of a Trust in one State can be forced upon the people of every other State, under the authority and protection of Federal law, and in defiance of any power that can be exercised by a State legislature. It only needs that the Trusts should find a home in some friendly StateŠas they have now in New JerseyŠto enable them to flourish in spite of all legislation that can be enacted elsewhere, under the decision given by Attorney-General Griggs. And that the Trusts, with their unlimited riches, will not be able to buy themselves a home in some State, in view of the susceptibility of legislators to the touch of wealth, is en-tirely too much to expect. This is the situation created by the Trusts to-day. The evil which they bring to the people is twofold. They drive multitudes of the smaller business concerns out of existence, thus crushing individual enterprise, reducing wages and wage earners, giving the country superior prices and inferior products, and swelling the already vast army of the unemployed; to which must be added  the fearfully demoralizing influence of an example which denies that honesty is the best policy, that diligence and frugality are the parents of wealth; and 'declares that it is good for the public man to be led into temptation, and that government exists by the consent of millions of dollars rather than of millions of men. And this is not all; for, on the other hand, the well-known tendency of a capitalized business to "water stock," when carried out in such huge concerns as the Trusts, threatens the country with a deluge which will sweep away the financial resources of millions who are being led to put their money into Trust securities. "I Ł expect," says Attorney-General Haines, of Maine, speak-ing on this point, "to see the greatest panic the country ever saw in less than five years as a result of Trusts." What must result from this tremendous disturbance of the balance of power so essential to the interests of republican government? What such a disturbance means in the atmospheric elements, it no less surely sig-nifies in organized human society; it is the precursor of a storm. And the violence of that storm will be in pro-portion to the extent to which the powers of .the people have become unbalanced. It will be, indeed, a cyclone of human passion, the hail of which will be bullets and the rain blood. In the year 1898 the total of authorized Trust stocks and bonds was $916,176,000; for the first two ' months of the present year the total is $1,106,300,000; and the estimated total for the full year, according to the Finan-cial Chronicle, exceeds $6,000,000,000. Thus rapidly is the barometer falling, and° at this rate how long will it be before natureŠhuman natureŠwill precipitate the struggle for readjustment, and the recovery of the powers and rights of the people? Superfluous Vigilance. SPEAKING of the work of the "American Sabbath Union," the Independent remarks that one of the duties devolving on this organization is that of watching the interests of the "Sabbath" in the legislatures. Much vigilance has to be exercised to prevent any lessening of the force of the "Sabbath laws." For example, it says, a section of the penal code in a certain State read: "All labor on Sunday is prohibited, excepting works of necessity or charity. In works of necessity or charity is included whatever is needful during the day for the good order and health or comfort of the community." An amendment to the last clause was introduced, providing that "In works of necessity is includedwhatever is needed during the day for the good Order, health, recreation, convenience or comfort of the community." Such pro-posed amendments to the "Sabbath laws" in the various States oblige the American Sabbath Union to keep a vigilant watch lest they receive legislative sanction and thus modify the rigor of the "Sabbath" statutes.
