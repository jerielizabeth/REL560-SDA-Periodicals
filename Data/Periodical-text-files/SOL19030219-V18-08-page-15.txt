5elleilulleil OF CligESTAIV Ufiglatrit Set for the defense of human rights, especially the rights of conscience. The only periodical in the United States devoted to the exposition and defense of the Christian and American principle of complete separation of Church and State. The Sentinel is not a periodical of abstractions and speculation; it discusses live issues that deeply concern every individual. JOHN D. BRADLEY, Editor. Editorial Contributorst A. T. JONES, A. G. DANIFT  I S, M. C. WILCOX, L. A. SMITH, C. P. BOLLMAN. Entered as Second-class matter of the New York 'Post-office. We believe in the religion taught and lived by Jesus Christ. We believe in temperance, and regard theliquor traffic as a curse to society. We believe in supporting civil government and submitting to its authority. We believe that human rights are sacred, and that they indissolubly inhere in the moral nature of the individual. We deny the right 01 any human authority to invade and violate these inalienable rights in any individual. Therefore we deny the right of any civil gov-ernment to legislate on matters of religion and conscience. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every individual to worship God ac-cording to the dictates of his own conscience, free from all dictation, interference, or control on the part of civil government or any other external authority; or not to worship at all if he so chooses. We also believe it to be our duty, and no less the duty of all others, to oppose religious legislation and all movements tending toward the same, to the end that all the people may freely enjoy the inestimable blessing of liberty, which is theirs by virtue of the unbounded wisdom and beneficence of the Author of their being.

I HAVE been reading THE SENTINEL from. the day the first copy was printed, and while I thought then, and all along, that it was the best paper published in its special field, to-day I think, in its present dress and under-its present management, no better journal is placed before the thinking world.

Just renew--for me and send the bill and I assure you that a prompt remittance will be forthcoming. U. GRANT ADKINS.
