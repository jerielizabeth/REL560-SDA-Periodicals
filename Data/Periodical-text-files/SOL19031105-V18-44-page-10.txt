698 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY to conform to others not his own. They doubtless were aware that some of the most essential rights of man had been invaded and wrested from him under various and flimsy pretexts and pre-tenses, and deemed it indiscreet to leave the liberty of conscience un-guarded or undefined, or the "free exercise of religious profession and worship" to be enjoyed on the equivo-cal and unstable tenure of inferences which might vary with the wisdom, weakness, interest or depravity of those to whose office it might appertain to draw them. They knew that history and their own observations bore con-current testimony that all political gov-ernments, and particularly those leagued with or influenced by the church, are prone to grasp at power, and often under color of implication, construction, expediency, supporting religion, and "suppressing immoral-ity," usurp authority never granted them. They therefore by the thirty-eighth article of the (old) constitution of this State declares as follows : And whereas we are required by the benevolent principles of rational liberty not only to expel civil tyranny, but also to guard against that spiritual oppres-sion and intolerance wherewith the bigotry and ambition of weak and wicked priests and princes have scourged mankind, this convention doth further, in the name and by the author-ity of the good people of this State, ordain, determine and declare that the free exercise and enjoyment of relig-ious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall for-ever hereafter be allowed within this State to all mankind; provided the lib-erty of conscience hereby granted shall not be construed so as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practises inconsistent with the peace and safety of this State. Thus we see that "the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession (opinion) and worship" is guaranteed  not to any one individual in the com-munity more than anotherŠnot to any one religious sect more than anotherŠnot to Christians in preference to Jews, Turks or heathenŠnot to believers in Christianity any more than infidels to that or any other creedŠnot to any one or any number of Christian sects in preference to any other -Christian sect; but to "ALL MANKIND within this State" without any preference of one to any other; and if there is one solitary individual "within this State" who is coerced by law or otherwise to violate his own religious opinions and conform to others not his own, then is there a discrimination made between the religious tenets of different por-tions of the communityŠthen is there a preference given to one, to the dis-paragement of anotherŠthen is "the free exercise of religious profession and worship" not enjoyed within this State by "all mankind;" and the con-stitution is as grossly and completely infracted by the violation of the rights of an individual person as if the rights of a whole sect or any number of the community had been invaded. For what possible or imaginary pur-pose could the article of the constitu-tion just quoted have been adopted, but for that which it expressly avows, to guard against "that spiritual op-pression and intolerance wherewith bigotry and ambition have scourged mankind," to compel one part of them, contrary to "the benevolent principles of rational liberty" and the equal rights of man, to conform to religious tenets they neither profess nor believe Indeed any law enacted to enforce con-formity to sectarian religious tenets carries with it intrinsic evidence of its unrighteous character; because if people conscientiously believed in the tenet intended to be favored by the law, no law would be necessary to enforce
