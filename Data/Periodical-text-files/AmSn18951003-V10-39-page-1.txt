BOLLMAN, LEON A. SMITH, - - ASSISTANT EDITOR. SOME PRINCIPLES STATED. GOD is the Creator, and therefore the right-ful sovereign of this world. Whatever he commands is to be performed by his loyal subjects, no matter if all earthly powers should combine to prevent it; and that which he forbids will not be done by them, no matter how many of earth's mighty ones require it. The divine rule is: " Obey God rather than men." When the Lord Jesus Christ was about to leave this earth, he gave to his church a com-mission: " Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;" and from that day to this, his faithful ministers have been going and preaching. When this commission was given, it was against human "law " to introduce any new religion into the Roman empire; and all the then known world was subject to Rome, so that in all the world it was against the " law" to preach the gospel. But Christ said " Go;" and they " went everywhere preaching the word." Almost everywhere the disciples of Christ met opposition from earthly powers in execut-ing this divine commission. They were per-secuted in Jerusalem, were imprisoned and whipped, and some of them " were slain with the sword," but still the survivors continued to preach the gospel according to the divine command. The opposition which the disciples met in their work did not surprise them, for the Master had told them that such would be the case. He said: " Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword." And gospel messen-gers found that it was even so. Wherever they went the wrath of Satan was stirred up against them; and it was only too often man-ifested through civil rulers. But this did not cause them to cease preaching the gospel.  When the magistrates commanded the apos-tles " net to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus," "Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard." The experience of the apostles has been re-peated in almost every country and in every generation from the beginning of their minis-try until the present time. Everywhere the gospel has been introduced in the face of op-position from the civil authorities; but Chris-tians have never stopped to question their duty in the premises. The history of modern Christian missions is quite as replete with illustrations of this truth as is the history of the more early preaching of the gospel. With but few ex-ceptions, heathen rulers have opposed the in-troduction of the gospel among their subjects; but without avail. Faithful men and women, counting " not their lives dear unto them," have penetrated the jungles of India, the des-erts of Africa, and the solitudes of the isles of the ocean, carrying with them the gospel, which they have faithfully proclaimed, whether men would hear or whether they would for-bear, and whether rulers gave their consent to its proclamation or not. So universally has the right of the Christian missionary to obey the gospel commission been seen and admitted, that we find the govern-ments of the principal " Christian nations " of the world insisting that Christian mission-aries shall be permitted to deliver their mes-sage to as many as will listen to it. Were it not for this, Christian missions, as they are Maintained to-day, would be an impossibil-ity in many lands: Turkey, China, and some of the islands of the sea, would still be with-out the gospel had the civil "law" been al-lowed to prevail rather than that higher law Šthe command of God, the gospel commis-sion. Even to-day we find various Protestant bodies insisting upon the right to go into Roman Catholic countries, and there not only to teach but to practice contrary to the " laws " of those lands; and when they are arrested and imprisoned under the forms of " law," they call it religious persecution, as is witnessed by the following letter published in the Loam Times, of Oct. 23, 1891:Š Religious Persecution in Portugal. The Evangelical Alliance has often experienced your kind consideration and ready help in making publicly known cases of intolerant action and oppression against Protestant Christians in foreign countries. We are therefore encouraged to solicit again the favor of your publishing in your columns an extract from a letter from Oporto, dated the 6th inst., reporting how a Protestant named Francisco Bichao, an inhabitant of Aveiro, has been thrown into prison under a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment and a fine of £2 or in default of payment a further term of three months' imprisonment. The offense charged against him, be-fore the civil court, was for refusing to take off his cap to a cross carried at a funeral. He appealed against the cruel sentence, and the letter above referred to now reports as follows:Š " The appeal to the Superior Court at Oporto was successful, inasmuch as the sentence was annulled on a technical pointŠviz., that it had not been clearly proved that he had wilfully treated the State Church with disrespect. His enemies, who were powerful, then carried the case to the Supreme Court at Lisbon, and here the original sentence was confirmed, on the ground that it was sufficiently proved that he com-mitted the act wittingly. As the constitution grants liberty of conscience, provided that the State religion is respected, it is easy to see how a point can be stretched even to a year's imprisonment for not re-moving a cap to a passing cross (not a crucifix) carried at a funeral. The sentence hung fire for a time, but when the abortive attempt to establish a republic failed at Oporto on the 31st of January last, the gov-ernment was enabled to use extraordinary restrictions of private liberties, as well as to gag the Liberal press, This was the opportunity, and Bichao was arrested on the 28th of February, and placed in Aveiro prison, He wrote to me on the 24th advising me of the fact, and adding, 'But I am happy ; blessed be the name of the Lord.' " We hoped that the usual Easter list of pardons might have included his name, but were disappointed in this, and there he lies, to the shame of popery, for it was a purely clerical persecution, and to the disgrace of Portugal, which poses as a Liberal nation, and in many respects is truly Liberal. But the Con-cordat with Rome still gives the priests great power when they choose to use it against the freedom of the gospel." Yours faithfully, J. FIELD, General, K. C. B., A. J.

This missionary, it will be obseryed, was imprisoned for not removing his cap to a cross at a funeral. He doubtless regarded such an act as idolatry and so refused to uncover his head in the presence of the passing cross; and Protestants everywhere say that he did right. More recently, Methodist missionaries in various South American countries have been
