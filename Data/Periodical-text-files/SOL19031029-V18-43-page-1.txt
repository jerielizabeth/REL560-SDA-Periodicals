The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., OCTOBER 29, 1903 =NO. 43 Enforcement of "the Sabbath-law" of the state means persecution for men who observe the Sabbath law of God. The fact that something is the belief or ellen the religion of others is no sufficient reason why one should refrain from "attacking" it. The propriety or rightfulness of "attack" upon a belief or religion depends not upon whether offense is given thereby, but upon whether truth and righteousness are ser'bed and advanced thereby. When the state undertakes to deal with the Lord's day, it may expect to have the Lord's word on the subject to deal with also. When men are arrested and tried in civil courts on the charge of "profanation of the Lord's day" by labor on another day than that which the Lord has designated as His day, they can with perfect propriety appeal to what the Lord has said on the subject in denial of the charge; and if the word of the Lord is not hearkened to in the matter, then it is evident that the state is attempting to deal with some-thing of the Lord's independent of Him, and is therefore in rebellion against Him in the matter. Who authorized Constantine, our legislature, or any dom-inant religious sect or church, to repeal, alter, relax, or sus-pend the decrees of God? Who empowered either church or state to appoint another sabbath than that appointed by the Lord ? Who gave them the right to authorize mankind to labor on the day on which God forbade any labor to be done? Whence does man derive the right to interdict labor on the first day of the week, one of the six God appointed and set apart for mart to do "all his work"?Å see page 683.
