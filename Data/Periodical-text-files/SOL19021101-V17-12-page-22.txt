752 THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY ladder with a brush in his hand painting his barn," and that although he was warned by officers of the law that he "had better stop work, as the work was not a work of necessity or charity," he "delib-erately went up the ladder and continued his work until he had finished it," and that he even had the hardihood to claim "that he had the right under the Bill of Rights to do that work." He was con-victed of the charge laid against him in the indictment, and was fined $to and costs. And this is only one of many sim-ilar cases that could be cited. By going back just a few years many cases could be cited in which far more serious pen-alties were inflicted for the same "crime." This very man, whose recent case we cite, was fined $50 in the same court for a very similar offense "against the peace of said Commonwealth" about five years ago, and could have been fined the same amount in this case had the magistrate seen fit to fix the fine at that sum. "Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad;" and surely it is enough to arouse the moral indignation of any man, and es-pecially in this 'particular matter of any American, when, with the declarations above quoted ringing in his ears, bring-ing forcibly to mind as they do a fresh and renewed realization of the funda-mental and inalienable character of the right to work, he reflects that for no other offense than that of exercising that right Š"fhe right of a man to do his work," a right to which "there is no right in God's universe comparable," a right that is "in-extinguishable and inalienable," that is "fundamental to the very safety and per-petuity of our Republic," which lies at `.the foundation of our national life" and without which "the personal guarantees of the Constitution are a dead letter and our doctrines of human liberty under a republican government are outgrown ; a right in the exercise of which it is de- dared that every citizen of the United States should be fully protected even if it requires thatŁthe entire military power of the nation shall be called into action,Šwe say, surely it is enough to arouse the moral indignation of every American cit-izen when he reflects that for exercising this right to work American citizens have been, in recent years, fined, imprisoned, and worked in the chain-gang with crim-inals by authority of the law, and that these legal penalties against the exercise of that right remain in force and are fre-quently called into requisition. And it is not likely to soothe the feeling of right-eous indignation which this brings to one's breast when the fact is noted that among the above emphatic declarations in support of the right to work are two from men who are active advocates and cham-pions of the sort of legislation that is re-sponsible for the flagrant wrongs to which we have referred. One of these , declarations, the one which contains the sentence, "Before the living God and the Carpenter of Nazareth, I say no man has a right to say to any other man WHEN or where he shall work," is by a man who is an active member and supporter of an organization which has for one of its ob-jects, and for which it has been working for many years, the securing from Con-gress of the enactment of a law by which the exercise of this right to work will be prohibited in all places subject to the na-tional authority during a specific period of twenty-four hours each week! In all this we of course have reference to the Sunday legislation and enforce-ment in the United States. "Ah," it will be said at once by some, "but this niatter of prohibiting labor on Sunday is not a mere matter of prohibiting labor." We are well aware that it is not ; but because we know that it is not likely to give a better aspect to an invasion and denial of a fundamental human right, and cer-
