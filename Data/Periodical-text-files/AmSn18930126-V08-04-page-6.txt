          VOL. to. I.                             upon the Cross, and the position of a bishop became one of Status, entourage, worldly circumstance, a shocking change for the worse took place. Christian bishops lived in splendor and luxury and no longer abstained from joining in the turbulent intrigues of pol-iticians and partisans. They began to flaunt in superb ecclesiastical vestments broidered with gold and enriched with gems. They reveled in such artificial and inflating titles as " Your Beatitude " and " Your Sanctity," and when they went abroad they appeared in magnificent ap-parel, lolling in lofty chariots. 2. Like priests, like people. If world-liness, avarice, and ambition so success-fully invaded the ranks of the episcopate, we are hardly surprised to find them tri-umphant among  the Christian laity. There is enough to shock us beyond meas-ure in the picture of the state of Chris-tianity at Rome itself which is given us by Saint Jerome, who came to it as to a very ark in the world's deluge, and found it an intolerable Babylon, seething with immorality, intrigue, lust, scandal, and spite. 3. Another sign of evil pagan influence was the growing irreverence in worship. The accounts of the early assemblies tell us of deep and rapturous devotion; of re-sponses which sounded like the voice of many waters; of the AMEN rolling its sounds afar like thunder. Already in Origen's time, much of this solemnity had vanished. It had been destroyed by dead-ening familiarity and unreal adhersion to the cause of Christ. Christians, as Saint Chrysostom tells us, would adjourn from their church to pagan shows; they pushed and jostled each other to get first to the Holy Table; they turned the great festival into scenes of intemperance and excess; they broke out into tumults of applause at the rhetoric of their preacher, but paid no attention to the spiritual truth ; forgot the application, and absented themselves from the prayers. 4. But the worship itselfŠwhich was a most serious evilŠhad been in various directions assimilated to paganism. If the heathen had their idols, the Christians after a time began to have their images and pictures. Faustus, Manichee though he was, had some grounds for the charges he made against the orthodox. (a) He made a charge of idolatry and semi-idolatry. At first Christianity was utterly opposed to pictures and images in churches, but they have become universal. Beausobre speaks of what he calls the " Christian idolatry," which was thus gradually introduced. (b) The charge of paganized religious gatherings is also abundantly proved by the regretful admission of contemporary saints. (c) It is needless to touch op. the grovel-ing relic-worship and cross-worship which earned for Christians from the pagans the nicknames of ash-adorers (cinerarii) and idolaters. 5. The pernicious influence of paganism showed itself in two other directionsŠin literature and government. The writings of the Apostolic Fathers are gentle and dignified. In time, however, as in the case of Saint Jerome, controversy was conducted with rabid abuse, in which words and epithets were used, disgraceful even on the lips of an ordinary gentleman and trebly disgraceful to a Christian. Writers called each other names, some-times too coarse for translation, and to this day, I deeply regret to say, their vile example is followed in the columns of what are called religious and semi-religious newspapers. 6. We can hardly be surprised that when to call a man " a monster," and " a scor-pion," and "a grunter," and "an impure demon," is regarded as a ferociously elo-quent way of saying that you disagree with him, actual persecution and cruel violence should speedily be resorted to for the enforcement of religious opinion. It would be quite possible to point out other directions in which the Church suffered grievous harm from her contact with the world. These, however, are suffi-cient, and they furnish abundant warning that the Church must never relax her vigilance, or forget that even a nominally Christian world may still be essentially of the world worldly.ŠArchdeacon Farrar, D. D., in Sunday Magazine, London, No-vember. is a sad but undisputable fact that in all ages of the world, the lovers of eternal truth and justice have been in the minor-ity, and the very principle advocated by Mr. Converse has invariably led to the persecution of the minority by the bigoted uncharitable majority. Had Christian Patriot views been car-ried out, we would have had no Luther or Calvin, no Wesley or Roger Williams, for these would have submitted to the "moral (?) convictions " of the majority. It may be, as the Patriot says, that "the State can not do theoretical or exact jus-tice;" but it can do one thing, and that is, attend to its own affairs, mind its legiti-mate business; turn its attention to affairs within its own jurisdiction. The editor of the Christian Patriot admits that a Seventh-day Adventist or a Mohammedan would have a theoretical right to be protected in his observance of another day than Sunday, but immedi-ately follows it up with the statement that to grant him such rights would be practical injustice. How a thing can be theoretically right and practically wrong, is beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals. Perhaps Mr. Converse can reconcile his paradoxes. " On what will you found legislation ? " asks the Patriot. On the same basis recognized by the founders of our Government, the framers of the Declaration of Independence and the ConstitutionŠthe natural, eternal, self-evident, inherent rights of all men; not the rights of the majority only. It is an almost worn-out saying that " right wrongs no man," and it is childish and absurd to say, that to grant to any man his natural right, will wrong some other man. It has yet to be shown that the work of any Seventh-day Adventist has ever dis-turbed a religious gathering on Sunday. The only thing that ever disturbed Sunday-keepers seems to have been the fact that a mile or so from the church was a man who presumed to have views of his own and preferred the Bible to the traditions of men. It appears remarkably strange that while the Sunday-keepers of Springville, Tenn., are annoyed, and their " moral sensibilities" are shocked, at the thought of a few God-fearing, Bible Sabbath-keep-ers working on a day that has no sacred-ness attached to it, nobody is annoyed or disturbed, or shocked in any manner whatever by the smelting furnaces near Graysville, Tenn., which are never closed on Sunday. "Mathematical justice is impossible in the political sphere," remarks the Patriot. For over a hundred years, the Constitu-tion has guaranteed religious liberty to the people of this country, and no one complained of any infringement upon their rights; no one felt that they were deprived of any privilege which was justly theirs : then why should not this state of things continue ? One reason is that men are becoming selfish, bigoted, narrow-minded; that apostate Protestantism is reviving the spirit of her corrupt mother, Roman Catholicism. Another reason is that the Spirit of God has foretold this movement and it is inevitable. ERNEST H. RUSSELL.          Basis of Civil Law. THE Christian Patriot asks this ques-tion :Š If you refuse to base legislation on the moral convictions of the majority of the people, on what will you found it? The editor of the Christian Patriot seems hopelessly bound to a centre stake around which he travels in a never ending circle, i. e., the idea that civil law must, of necessity, be based on the " moral convictions" of the people; and according to his view, moral convictions and reli-gious convictions are synonymous terms. For many years people of a poetic or romantic turn of mind have had the idea, and freely expressed it, that all law is based upon the ten commandments. This all sounds very beautiful, but it has no foundation in fact. All just, civil laws are based upon the inherent rights of all men. In other words, all just laws are but the develop-ment or the expression of rights already existing. Justice is eternal, self-existing and self-evident, and the only province of legislation is to protect rights, not to ac-cord them. Too many people assume, without a second thought, that Sunday legislation is based upon the moral convictions of the majority of the people, when, in fact, the real basis is the narrow, bigoted opinions of a number of church members. " The people " have never been con-sulted in this matter, and were the ques-tion fairly canvassed and submitted to them, Sunday laws would be snowed under by an overwhelming majority, and the advocates of the measure know it well, and so they resort to threats of boy-cott, to fraudulent, padded petitions to bolster up an unrighteous, unholy move-ment. It is the moral conviction of the major-ity of church members in the United States, that sprinkling and pouring, only, are baptism and they exclude immersion. Would these people be justified in forcing their views upon the minority, simply because they, the majority, considered immersion vulgar or immodest ? And yet the same principle obtains in regard to Sunday legislation. One grave mistake made by the editor of the Christian Patriot and by many other people, is, in taking it for granted that the " moral convictions " of the ma-jority are necessarily right and true. It IF the religion of Jesus has not suf-ficient vitality to stand, independent of State patronage, then let it fall.ŠRev. Joseph, Wasson,
