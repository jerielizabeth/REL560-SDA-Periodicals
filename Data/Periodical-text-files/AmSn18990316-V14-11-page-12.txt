172 AMERICAN SENTINEL. Jimmie Green's Lesson. "WAIT, Jimmie, where you goin'Što school?" "Why, no, Jakey Waters; it's a funny thing if you don't know there haint no school to-day,ŠWashington's birthday!" and Jimmie Green cast a sidewise glance that was meant fully to express to Jakey his extreme disgust that apy one could possibly be so ignorant. The glance was not lost upon the little fellow, as evinced by the an-swering flash in the blue eyes. "Now, James Green, I guess I know just as much about General George Washington as you do,Šwhen my own grandpa's grandfather helped him whip the British." "Well, I thought 'twas queer if you didn't know that. Everybody knows when Washington's birthday is; say," continued Jimmie, "when I get to be a man, I hope something'll happen so I can do up the British or somebody else, just like Washington. 0, I'm going to be a soldierŠlike himŠor Hobson, or Sampson, or Š"- "Why, Jimmie Green!" exclaimed Jakey, with indig-nation, "you dunno what you're a talkin' about. Just think of allthe folks that would have to be killed=mother says war's an awful, awful thing. I'm goin' to be a mis-sionary." "What does your ma know about it! I tell you it's just jolly. There's drums and fifes and shiny swords, and when people don't do as you want 'em to, all you've got to do is to lick 'em and make 'em. My! I wouldn't be a stupid missionary! catch me!" "Good morning, boys," said a cheery voice behind them, that Jimmie at once recognized as that of his Sab-bath-school teacher. The lad's face flushed deeply, for someway he had a vague idea that his teacher had heard his last remark and would not approve of his ambitiOn to force people to do what he wanted them to, at the point of the bayonet. "Well, my boys," he continued, "what is the question you are discussing so earnestly?" Jimmie only hung his head, and muttered very lowŠ"Nothin' much;" but Jakey's eyes sparkled, for herightly judged that he had gained a champion for his cause, and he hastened to explain matters to the gentleman who was already leading Jimmie by the hand. "Jimmie here he thinks it's right to make people do as you want 'em to, if you're the biggest, even if you-have to fight 'em and kill 'em." Jimmie's little head was hanging down lower than ever by the time Jakey had finished his explanation, and it seemed to him he had never felt so mean in his life; but although he knew his little friend had told the story as it was, he managed to blurt out:Š , "I don't neither!" He really expected Mr. Wills would give him a very serious talking to, and so his sur-prise and relief were very great, when the gentleman be-gan talking of something else, with never a look at Jim-mie. But Mr. Wills was a wise man, and he knew that an object lesson was sometimes far more valuable than words alone could be. _ Presently they came to the corner where Jimmie must turn down another street; to do an errand for his mother, and the chubby little hand, from which his teacher had not once relaxed his hold, began squirming around to free itself from the big brown hand that held it so tightly. "Why, what are you trying to do, Jimmie?" asked Mr. Wills in surprise. "Nothing', only I've got to go down Hill Street for mother, so I can't go with you any further, teacher," ex-plained Jimmie, surprised to see that the little hand was still held in a close grasp. "But I need a boy to help me carry home the parcels I am going after,Šwhy, you're just the boy. I couldn't think of giving you up." "Why, Mr. Wills," protested Jimmie, beginning to look serious, "I can't help you, I want to get back so I can have some fun playing ball with the boysŠit's a hol-iday, you know!" "Yes, yes, I know; but why should I care? I'm larger and stronger than you are, and I guess it would be about the best thing for me to do, to make you come along and help me. I need you, and you don't need to play. Besides, I'm stronger, you see you can't get away." "0, Mr. Wills! I don't think it's right or fair for a. great big man like you to make a little boy help him just because he's bigger'n him." "0, I don't mean to hurt you, unless you refuse to do as I want you toŠthen of course Š" By this time Jimmie was crying and wondering what had come over his usually kind teacher. But Mr. Wills decided that his lesson must be well impressed upon the young heart. "Well, my boy, I will let you go; but I hope you will remember that people like their liberty in this world, and that it is not just to force them to do what they do not think is right. The law of war is a law of force, my boy, and often it is might against right. Don't you remem-ber the verse I gave you to learn for next Sabbath,Šthe pretty song the angels sang to the shepherds when the Christ child was born?" "0 yes, sir," said Jimmie, as he trudged away, it is 'Peace on earth, good will toward men."' MRS. L. D. AvERY-STUTTLE.
