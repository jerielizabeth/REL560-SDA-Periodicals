The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIH NEW YORK, APRIL 16, 1903  NO. 16   The act of 1794, but for the exception "works of necessity and charity," dooms every citizen of this Com-monwealth to absolute idleness on the first day of the week. The act applies to all men and to all forms of work, public and private, mercenary or purely personal. The scholar pursuing his studies in his closet, the astronomer gazing at the heavenly bodies from his observatory, the artist before his canvas, the musician with his bow and viol, are just as much under the ban of this statute as the blacksmith at his forge, or the farmer in his fields, the mother plying her needle and thread, or the husband mending chair, table or cradle. Whether the work be silent or noisy, in the privacy of the home or the publicity of the streets, it is indiscrimi-nately prohibited, except it come within the indefinite pro-tection of a word with such an elusive meaning as that of "necessity." The act, therefore, is a prohibition of nat-ural rightŠthe right to use the body and mind in work and occupation, industry and activity. . . . If such an  enactment were made as to another day of the week I pre-sume there would be no question whatever as to the un-constitutionality of the statute. THE RADICAL AND EXCEPTIONAL NATURE OF THE LEGISLATION IS NOT CHANGED BY THE FACT THAT THE PROHIBITION RELATES TO SUNDAY. ŠFrom argument of Er Judge James G.
