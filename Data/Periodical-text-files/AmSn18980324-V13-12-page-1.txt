Ir is just as impossible to legislate good deeds out of bad men, as to legislate good fruit out of a bad tree. THE measure of strength, and prosperity in any gov-ernment can be accurately judged by the degree of civil and religious freedom enjoyed by those living under it. Owl, government can accomplish its ends only as it has and employs force to compel obedience; Christianity can accomplish her ends only as she refrains from the use of force. A SUNDAY law, or any form of religious legislation, is a blow which falls much more severely upon free gov-ernment than upon the individuals who are its intended victims. - THERE is a pope within you, unless the kingdom of God is within you. It is the popery in people by naŁ tare that makes possible and calls for a pope outside of them. 4 OnGHT the citizen of Spain, in case of war over the "Maine" disaster, to be patriotic and support his coun-try, and do all the damage possible to this country? If not, why not? THE man who wants to keep Sunday can keep it with-out any Sunday law; and the man who doesn't want to keep Sunday can get neither rest nor religion out of such a law if he has one. "CoME up and see my zeal for the Lord," said Jehu, the king of Israel, as he was on his way to execute venge-ance upon the stronghold of idolatry; but Jehu did not accomplish much as a reformer. And the reason was that his reform work was by force of arms and not by the power of the Spirit. IT is said there must be no union of church and state, because that would discriminate against some of the churches. But how can there be a union of the state with religion without discriminating against some religion? And if it be right for the civil, power to discriminate against one religion in favor of another, why is not such discrimination just as regards the churches? The Question of Disturbance. IT is provided in nearly every Sunday law upon the statute books of the States, that any work that is to be permitted on Sunday must not be to the "disturbance" of other people. This provision is a hollow sham. It is not lawful to disturb peopleŠin any proper sense of the wordŠon any day of the week. It is no more law-ful to disturb people on Monday than it is on Sunday. Unless a different and extraordinary kind of disturb-ance is meant by this provision of the Sunday laws,there-fore, there is no possible reason for making it. But why should some extraordinary meaning be put upon the word "disturbance" for Sunday only? Whatever disturbs the mid-week prayer-meeting, or the devotions of any person on ordinary days of the week,  is a disturbance in the proper sense, and is prohibited by law, irrespective of Sunday statutes. And whatever does not disturb people on such occasions, cannot properly be considered a disturbance on the first day of the week. But some people are very much "disturbed" by the mere knowledge that other persons are at work on their day of rest, thus indicating that they dissent from their views as regards the sanctity of the day. They want
