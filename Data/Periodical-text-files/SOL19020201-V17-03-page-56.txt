Ad-dress, THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY, II W. loth St., New York City. We are obliged to call attention to another mortifying typographical error. In the title under the illustration on page 96 of our last issue the word "Teetor" should of course have been "Teeter," but the printers seemed determined not to have it "Teeter," and after insisting that it be "Tutor" they finally went so far as to make it "Teetor." We shall do our utmost to see that it does not become necessary again to call attention to errors of this kind. The celebrated leader of the Tammany political organization of New York City, Richard Croker, has been succeeded in that capacity by Mr. Lewis Nixon. It is rumored that Mr. Croker's with-drawal from the management of the or-ganization will result in its reorganiza-tion on lines of "relative respectability." It is generally believed that Tammany is shrewdly preparing the way for a return to power.
