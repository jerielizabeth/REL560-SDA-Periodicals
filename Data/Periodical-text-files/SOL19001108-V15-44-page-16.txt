Any one receiving The Sentinel of Liberty without having ordered it, may know that it is sent by some friend. Those who have not ordered The Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. ¥ THE secretary of the " New England Sabbath Protective League " reports through its organ that he has spoken seventeen times in the interests of the league the past month [October], and his en-gagements reach into February of 1901. al IT is stated that an anti-Sunday-excursion bill will be presented at the the next session of the Maine legislature. Most of the religious bodies in the State have appointed strong committees " to watch over the bill." al THE Bible will not be read in the public schools of Chicago. This decision was reached recently by the school board by a vote of thirteen to six. The vote was upon a book of selections made by a com-mittee of which Professor Swing and Cardinal Gib-bons were members. The book is in use in the schools of a number of American cities. .4 .4 A RECENT London despatch says: " The Sultan of Turkey continues to oppress the Armenians in the most heartless manner, according to a report of Bishop Mush to the Armenian Patriarch at Con-stantinople. He says everything in the way of crops, sheep, cattle, and furniture has been carried off by the Kurds and that many Armenians have died of starvation. The report concludes that the despair of all Armenians in these districts is such that they have come to wish that a general massacre might terminate their sufferings." THE election in California this week decides that State's future policy touching the question of the taxation of church property. Up to this time  church property in California has been taxed, but now, as the result of persistent agitation by church leaders, a constitutional amendment is before the people "to exempt from taxation all buildings used solely and exclusively for religious worship, and so much of the real property as is required for their convenient use an] occupation." .4 .3% THE State Christian Citizenship League of Illi-nois has sent to every candidate for election to the Illinois legislature a list of questions, with a request for an answer to the same. The attitude of the can-didate toward these questions, it is understood, will in each case determine the attitude of the Christian Citizenship League toward the candidate at the polls. The questions in this case relate principally to the saloon, but if they related to Sunday enforce-ment and other religious measures it would not be beyond the scope of the Christian Citizenship move-ment, as outlined in its literature. We are unques-tionably rapidly approaching the time when candi-dates for political office will have to pass a religious test in order to be sure of the church vote. .9 .4 THE liquor dealers' organization in Lexington, Ky., is lending its influence in favor of Sunday clos-ing of the saloons, so as to render these disreputable institutions " law-abiding." The saloon, however, being a natural breeder of crime, is a natural outlaw, and its character is not changed in the least by its observance of Sunday. This attitude of the liquor organization is pleas-ing to some of Lexington's clergy, one of whom, in commending Sunday closing, said that " the con-tinual strain on nerve and brain is too severe without such refreshing, invigorating, and elevating in-fluences as come from one day out of every seven devoted to moral, intellectual, and physical repairs." This is a poor argument for Sunday closing as ap-plied to the saloon. If the strain of keeping open and doing business seven days in the week would be-come so severe as to wreck the institution entirely, by all means let the saloon be kept open the week through. We are not anxious for the liquor busi-ness to experience a periodical recuperation by the observance of Sabbath rest. .0 .0 THE state deals with crime, but God alone has the authority to deal with sin.
