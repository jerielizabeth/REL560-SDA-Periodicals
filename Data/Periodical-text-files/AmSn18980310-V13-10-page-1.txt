 " IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HEW NOT."ŠJesus Christ.    VOL. 13, No. 10. NEW YORK, MARCH 10, 1898. Single copy .3 cents.           The American Sentinel is published in the interests of religious libertyŠChristian and Constitutional. 1? -Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore those who have ,not ordered the Sentinel need have no tears that they will be asked to pay for it (Entered at the New York Post-office.) THE primary object of proper legislation is protec-tion to the individual. 44 4 AN appeal to precedent is often a convenient but never a justifiable means of ignoring duty. ANY religious institution which cannot be upheld by truth and love alone, would better go down. IF you vote for a Sunday law or for any form of re-ligious legislation, be assured it will hurt nobody more than yourself. 4 So long as conscientious conviction remains inde-pendent of legislation or physical force, so long will the supervision of morality remain outside the sphere of the state. THE law of God makes of the Sabbath a day of rest. The law of man can only make of it a day of restraint. There is no ease in restraint, and there can be no true rest without ease. 414  "GrvE me liberty or give me death," said Patrick Henry. A good many to-day say, Give me liberty and give me death.

THERE are in progress in the United StatesŠand else-whereŠtwo movements which aim at a reformation in the observance of the "Sabbath." One of these movements depends for success upon the enactment and enforcement of laws by which all persons will be compelled to observe the day. The other, repre-senting but a small minority of the people, could not if it would call to its aid the arm of the civil power. It depends for success wholly upon the spiritual power of truth. Both of these movements are making progress; they are both marked. But the latter is, in principle, a direct contradiction of the former. With the vast preponderance of numbers, influence, and wealth on its side, the movement for a stricter and more general observance of Sunday, claims that legisla-tion and prosecution are necessary to turn the people to an observance of the Sabbath. On the other hand, the movement for the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath asserts that legislation, so far from being a help to Sab-bath observance, is a positive and formidable hindrance .• 4 4 IF the world is growing worse, it is because men are
