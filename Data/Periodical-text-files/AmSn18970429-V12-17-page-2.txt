 258 AMERICAN SENTINEL.          gious combination again to disregard this principle would be to start upon a course whose end could not be in any wise different from that which went before; for the Christian principle is for ever the same, and the consequences of the disregard of it will be ever the same. As disregard of this principle in the fourth century made the papacy, with all that it has ever been since, so the disregard of this principle in the nineteenth century must make the very likeness of the papacy in all its as-pects. The papacy has been in history what it has been, not because the men who made it and have been con-nected with it were worse than all other men. The men who made the papacy, and who have ever been connected with it, have always been simply human beings, just like all other human beings. What the papacy has been in history is not because of the men, but because of the principles which actuated the men. Take men from any place on the earth, and let them espouse the principles of the papacy, and the history of the papacy will be reproduced just as far as the men have power to do it. In all our discussions of the papacy our attacks have not been upon the men, as such, who were connected with it; but upon the principles which charac-terize it and which have caused the papacy to present to the world the history that it has., Therefore, in pointing out that the success of the Na-tional Reform Association would produce in the United States the living image of the papacy, and insisting al-ways that this must be the inevitable consequence, we have done so solely because that the principles which actuate the National Reform Association, and which that Association were determined to fasten upon the Govern-ment of the United States, are the identical principles that have produced the history that has been made by the papacy. It is the disregard of the Christian princi-ple announced by the Lord for the guidance of the Church and the State as respects their attitude toward each other. And in all this we have been maintaining the principle upon which the Government of the United States was founded. For those who made the nation, with its fun-damental principle of separation of religion and the State said that "it is impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects that pro-fess the Christian faith, without erecting a claim to in-fallibility which would lead us back to the church of Rome." Whether they meant in this, to say that such a thing would lead the country back to the domination of the church of Rome itself, or whether they meant that it would lead back to the principles of the church of Rome in the hands of some other sect, is immaterial ; be-cause the distinction is so slight as to be indeed imma-terial. We have always said that ruin would come to the nation as certainly as this National Reform scheme should be allowed to succeed; because of the hypocrisy and general deviltry that by it would be made to prevail. We have pointed to the ruin that came upon the Roman empire as the consequence of just such a, movement in theŁ fourth century. It can never be too often repeated, and it must never be forgotten, that it was the "Christian" Roman empire that perished under- the barbarian raids. of the fourth and fifth centuries. It was more than sixty years after the Roman empire had become "Christian" before the flood of barbarians broke upon the empire. It was more than ninety years before the barbarians in-vaded the Western empire. It was more than thirty years after the three emperors, by a special decree, had.  required "all subjects of the empire, of whatever party or name, to adopt the faith of the Catholic Church and-assume the name of Catholic Christians,' " and had thus made the whole empire "Christian," before any nation of the barbarians fastened itself permanently upon Roman soil. Thus all the evidence shows that it was the "Chris-tian" Roman empire, and not the Pagan, that perished under the invasions of the barbarians, of the North ;Šand this because the so-called Christian empire was worse than ever the Pagan had been. For under the system of an established church, of enforced religious dogmas, hypocrisy had been added to the natural cussedness that, already prevailed; and even as Dr. Schaff has stated, "Nothing but the divine judgment of destruction upon this nominally Christian but essentially heathen world could open the way for the moral regeneration of so-ciety." A like course can not be followed in the United States without reaching a like result. So that the success of the National Reform scheme of Christianizing the United States Government; of making this a "Christian nation;" placing all Christian laws, institutions, and usages on a legal basis, and requiring respect to them as legal by all the people, would be the surest token of impending ruin. This is as certain as the law that "like causes produceŁ like effects." But this evil is not, and cannot be, confined merely to the United States. We have pointed out that the in-fluence of the United States Government, while it adhered strictly to the principles upon which it was founded, has. been powerful to lead all the nations toward religious freedom; so that by foreign publicists this nation has been called- "the classic land of religious liberty." And when,, under the influence and power of the National Reform combination, this country shall be led to the sub- version of these principles, to the recognition of religion in national affairs, the influence of this perversion will be equally powerful to carry the other nations backward again to religious despotism, and thus the evil thing be- comes world-wide. Then when "the divine judgment of destruction upon this nominally Christian but essentially heathen world" shall again fall, as surely it must fall, the destruction will be world-wide. And all nations being involved in the evil, it will be impossible for the Lord to find on the earth any new nations by whom to sweep away this earth-breaking curse; and nothing remains
