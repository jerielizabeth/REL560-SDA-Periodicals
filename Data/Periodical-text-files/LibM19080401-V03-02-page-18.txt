16 LIBERTY could only be justified by the religious character of the day, and we have already seen that that aspect of Sunday can not be taken into account in framing the Sun-day laws." The same ground is maintained by John Stuart Mill, in his work, " On Liberty." From the chapter, " Of the Limits to the Authority of Society over the Individual," I take this clear statement of the case: The only grounds, therefore, on which re-strictions on Sunday amusement can be de-fended must be that they are religiously wrong; a motive of legislation which can never be too earnestly protested against. Deorum injuriae Diis curae.' It remains to be proved that society or any of its officers holds a commission from on high to avenge any supposed offense to Omnipo-tence, which is not also a wrong to our fe.low creatures. The notion that it is one man's duty that another should be religious was the foundation of all religious persecu-tions ever perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justify them. Though the feel-ing which breaks out in the repeated at-tempts to stop railway traveling on Sun-day, in the resistance to the opening of museums and the like, has not the cruelty of the old persecutors, the state of mind indicated by it is fundamentally the same. It is a determination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their religion because it is not permitted by the perse-cutors' religion. It is a belief that God not only abominates the act of the disbe-liever, but will not hold us guiltless if we leave him unmolested." As further testimony on this point I quote again from Mr. Cornelison's " Relig-ion and Civil Government," page 315: " Surely fishing would be no offense if the law had been intended to be only a civil regulation to preserve the peace and good order of society. Mr. W. M. Ramsay, the counsel for the plaintiff in Miner, et al., v. the Board of Education of Cincinnati, in alluding to this point in the decision, very aptly said, 'A quiet seat by the bank of a pleasant stream with a fishing-rod would be an admirable disposition of one's self for a day of rest and reinvigoration after six days' toil.' " These considerations are surely sufficient to establish the fact that in prohibiting innocent amusements on Sun-day, this bill is religious in its character. Peaceable Assemblies Already Protected by Law In permitting the performance of works of necessity on the first -day of the week, this bill expressly states that such works must be " so performed as not to interfere with the repose and religious liberty of the community." But how could honest toil interfere with " the repose and religious liberty of the community," on the first day of the week more than on other days when religious services are held, unless it be on the ground that there is a divine law which constitutes one day as a sacred day, and that, therefore, even works of necessity must be performed so as to avoid, if pos-sible, even the appearance of desecrating the day? The Methodist Episcopal Con-ference has recently held its sessions in this city. The religious services were con-ducted on every day of the week, but there INDEX TO GROUP OF SENATORS Alabama - 1. J.
