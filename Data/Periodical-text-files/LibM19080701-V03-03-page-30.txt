The last session of Congress. however, surpassed all others in the num-ber of Sunday bills introduced and the earnest efforts put forth to have them passed. No less than ten separate bills were before Congress, most of them ask-ing for a Sunday law for the District of Columbia.

The clamor of the religious element of the nation for the support of religious dogmas indicates a sad condi-tion of spiritual decadence, and once the civil power yields to it, the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful exam-ple of the sequel.
