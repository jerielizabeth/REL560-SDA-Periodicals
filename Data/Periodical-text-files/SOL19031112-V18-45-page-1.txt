The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., NOVEMBER 12, 1903 NO. 45 INŁ101 Those rb,ho believe that Sunday should be regarded religiously, and that its observance should tend to the uplift-ing of society, ought to be the first to ask for the cessation of compulsory idleness with its attendant temptations to crime and degradation. They ought to ask, also, that the question should be freed from all complications with politics and 'with lower considerations and placed, once for all, upon its true basis as a religous institution, regard for which, in order to be helpful or morally or religiously healthful, must be based upon regard for divine law, and therefore upon conscience toward God and not compulsory obedience to law.ŠSee page 714. What is more immoral or licentious than that act lrhich forces one portion of the community to conform to religious tenets they neither profess nor believe What act more unjust, cruel and licentious than that which, by depriving men of their property and scourging them by imprisonment, compels them against their consciences to conform to religious creeds which they conscientiously believe to be untrue ? What act more inquisitorial than that which vests justices of the peace and courts of law with ecclesiastical jurisdiction, giving them authority to inquire into the religious creeds of men? If these are not such acts of licentiousness as the con-stitution interdicts and declares liberty of conscience shall not be so construed as to excuse, language is destitute of meaning and Uritten constitutions empty nonsense.ŠSee Page 716. vv orus on tile Junuay=uaw ylleS1-1011 PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR PUBLICATION OFFICE: 222 NORTH CAPITOL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.
