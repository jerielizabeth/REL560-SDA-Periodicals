The true principles are, of course, to be found in the Bible, but a new booklet has just been prepared by Alonzo T. Jones entitled "CHRISTIAN PATRIOTISM," that plainly and forcibly points out the right position for all to assume. It is a Biblical, original, and thoroughly common sense treatise on this important subject, and is of vital interest just now. Every SENTINEL reader should have a copy.
