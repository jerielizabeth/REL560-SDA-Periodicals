'rpm AMERICAN SENPriNEL, 27                         not' certain at all that they will be left free to choose whether they will do nothing or do works of religion; because if men choose to do nothing at all, that will be only idleness, and Mr: Crafts declares in book, page 373, that " idleness, as well as business is Sabbath breaking." The object of the American Sabbath Union., and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, is to secure Sabbath keeping, not Sabbath 'breaking, in the District of Co-lumbia and the Nation; therefore, any man, who, under this bill should exercise his right of choice and do nothing, would be a Sabbath-breaker. And as the object of these people is to secure Sabbath keep-ing, it is not at all certain that such a person would be left free to proceed freely on his course of Sabbath breaking. But, by the very easiest construction that could. be pit upon such a law, it is certain that,  under it, everybody would be forced either to break the Sabbath or to do works of religion; would be forced either to be wicked or to be religious. Twompel people by law to do either of these things is wicked. Therefore, the proposed District Sunday law; the proposed national Sunday law, and every other Sunday law that ever was, are evil in themselves. By such laws civil government is forced into a field where it is impossible to do that which it sets about to do, By such laws civil gov-ernment undertakes to secure that which can be secured by the Lord alone, by his Spirit upon the individual conscience. As we have proved the effect of such a law upon those who are not religious nor incline0 to. perform works of religion L Sunday is :lip compel them to be idle. This is to be' enforced by a penalty of "not ' more, than a hundred dollars for every offense." Idleness is the prolific cause of dissipation, vice, and crime, Honest oc-cupation on Sunday or any other time is better than idleness, and to enforce idle-ness under a penalty of a hundred dollars, as by this bill,, or a thousand dollars as by the national bill, is to put just that large a premium upon dissipation, vice and crime. And that society can never afford. The District bill, as, the national, has a proviso also, excepting from the provisions of this act "persons who conscientiously believe and observe any' other day of the Week than Sunday as a day of rest." This, as said Mrs Catlin, Superintendent of Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union for the District of Columbia, is directed at those who keep the seventh day as the Sabbath, and for the purpose of "taking the wind out of their sails" and thus stop-ping their opposition to ,Sunday laws. But the opposition of the seventh-day people as we understand it, is not because these are Sunday laws particularly, but because it is religious legislation of itself, whether it be in favor of Sunday or any other day. As we understand, it, the Christians who keep the seventh day would be just as much opposed to such legislation in favor of Saturday as they are to this. They act wholly upon the principle of the thing and not from policy at all. It, therefore, remains to be seen whether the wind can be taken out of their sails by any such device. This District bill 'is of more importance to the people at large than many are apt to think. Because, if Congress can legis-late upon this subject for the . District of Columbia, it can legislate upon the same subject to the full extent of 1.1;,-.) national jurisdiction. If Congress c; n legislate upon the subject at, all, it can do so to the full extent of the national power. Therefore, if the people at large sit quietly and let the matter be passed' without protest for the DiStrict of Columbia, they cannot protest when the same power is carried beyond the District of Columbia. The whole Nation is inter-ested in this just as much as though it was a national bill direct. Let the whole Nation, speak here ! Let it speak promptly and decidedly, against any legislation by Congress touching matters pertaining to another world, to things spiritual or holy, to the soul, to another life or anything pertaining to religion. Let the Constitu-tion be respected both in the District of Columbia and in all the Nation in its declaration that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." And 'let Nall the people say, Amen. A. T. J. do close ? And the ,, same with all other branches of business. Again, according to the best medical authorities, smoking is a -Very injurious habit. Nicotine, the poison 'of tobacco;  is One of the most deadly poisons known;  and many deaths result every year from its baleful effects. There is absolutely no necessity for smoking; therefore;  the State should forbid it on sanitary grounds, Would the PennsylVania, cigar dealer ad. mit this ? Certainly not;  for it Would ruin his business which he thinks would not be effected by Sunday closing. It seems highly probable that this philanthropic dealer in a deadly narcotic is not altogether uninfluenced in his desire for Sunday dos-ing of cigar stands by the fact that if no-body sold cigars on Sunday it would de-crease the amount which he pays for clerk hire without making a, corresponding re= auction in his profits, The idea of a cigar dealer being so much concerned about the public health is too utterly absurd to be amusing. C. P. BOLLMAN.  Rome and Liberty.   Tins article which we clip from Present Truth, a religious paper published in London, shows than even in England the contest now being waged in this country between the principles of Protestantism and the principles of the Papacy, is being watched with no little interest. The fact is also recognized that the principles of the so-called National Reform Association are the principles of Rome. Present Truth says:Š In an Encyclical published a few years ago, the Pope said, "All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the Constitu-tions of States, and legislation, to be modeled on the principles of the true church. All Catholic writers and journal-ists should never lose, for an instant, from view the above prescriptions." It has been urged officially that this should be specially kept in mind in England and the United States. The activity of Catholics, as Romanists, in the field of politics and journalism in England, is a coast nt re-minder that the advice is being a,cte upon. The recent Catholic Congress in erica has drawn attention again to the ork of Rome in the United States. A sus icious feature of the conference was the r peated and vociferous protestation of loy lt,- to free institutions. Those who are 1 yA at heart are content to let their liv s and work show it, and do not find it ne essary to multiply honeyed words. It as not many years ago that a papal en yclical anathematized "those who asse t the liberty of conscience and of r ligious worship." Speaking of the pros nt po-sition of the controversy in A ricaŠand we can see there more fully dev loped, perhaps, the forces which are at orli in  Por the Publlp Health. THE organ of the 'American Sabbath Union tells of a cigar dealer in Philad1-,_ phia who is in favor of Sunday closing of cigar stands, and attributes to him this language :Š To work every day is an overtax on nature, which is sure to be followed by bad health, disease, and incapacity for any work at all. There is no neces-sity for the cigar stores keeping open on Sunday. Cigars are not a necessity, and hence come under the provisions of the law of 1794. I do not think the general closing of the stores on Sunday would effect the sale of cigars or 'diminish the receipts. The cigars which are now sold on Sunday would then be sold on Saturday or Monday. The plan if adopted would result to the mutual benefit of em-ployee and employer alike. I do not take the stand from a religious standpoint, but with a desire to improve the general health of those who now work every day. There are two or three points in this worthy of notice. First, there is the as-sumption that to work every day is to overtax nature. This may be true to some extent, but must the law interpose to pre-vent everybody from thus overtaxing nat-ure ? And if so, why confine this govern-mental interposition for the good of the people to any one day of the week ? If to work more than eight or ten hours per day is to overtax nature, why should not the State require all cigar stands to close at 6 P. M. instead of at the late hour at which they
