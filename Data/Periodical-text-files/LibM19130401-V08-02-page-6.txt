TURNING TO CAESAR Your Sunday bills and all other forms of act-of-Parliament religion seem to one to be all wrong. Give us a fair field and no favor, and our faith has no cause to fear. Christ wants no help from Caesar. I should be afraid to borrow help from the government; it would look to me as if I rested on an arm of flesh instead of depending on the living God.Š Spurgeon. as80000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040 Ł Ł . . . 4 Ł 44404x.4444444444040®4,4444444$44444444444444
