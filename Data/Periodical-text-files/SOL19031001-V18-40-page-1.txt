The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, OCTOBER 1, 1903 NO. 40 WNW "The church and the state occupy two distinctly differ-ent realms. The realm of the church is the realm of morals; the realm of the state is the realm of civics. The realm of the church is the inner life of man, and the world to come; the realm of the state is the outward life of man, and the world that is. . . . The state, within its own realm, and for itself, has a right to establish a system of education, which in the nature of things must be only of this world. The church, in her own realm, must maintain Christian education, . . . and must not antagonize the state in its chosen system of education, any more than in any other affair or act of the state within its own realm." The clerical suppressor of ()Pork and play on Sunday thinks he is suppressing immorality; he is in reality pro- moting it. Idleness is not morality; its certain fruit is immorality. In attempting to suppress the imaginary and fictitious immorality of innocent and healthful games and sports on Sunday by those whom they compel by legislation to refrain from honest and useful industry, the Sunday-enforcement clergy become in a very real sense promoters of immorality. Would it not be in place for them to tone down somewhat their claim of being the moral conserva-tors of society?
