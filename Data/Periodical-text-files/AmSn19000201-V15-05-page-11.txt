AMERICAN SENTINEL. 75 that shall be made toward preventing cursing and swear-ing on the public streets." The question may be raised, What constitutes swear-ing? And it should be, remembered, that different an-swers would be given to it by Protestants and Catholics. In Catholic countries it is a gross offense to speak dis-respectfully of the Virgin Mary, or of the State religion. The question is a religious one, and therefore one which the civil authority cannot settle. In attempting to settle it the civil authority goes out of its proper sphere and establishes a precedent from which much evil is liable to result. "In God We Trust." ORIGIN OF THIS INSCRIPTION ON UNITED STATES COIN. MR. PRESTON, director of the mint, has run down the origin of the motto, "In God We Trust," to be found on our coins. It appears the first suggestion of such a motto came probably from W. R. Watkinson, of Ridley-vine, Penn., who signed himself a "minister of the gos-pel." His letter to Secretary Chase on the subject was dated November 13, 1861. He said:Š "You are probably a Christian. What if our Repub-lic *ere now shattered beyond reconstruction? Would not the antiquaries of succeeding centuries rightly reason from our past that we were a heathen nation? What I propose is that instead of the Goddess of Liberty we shall have next inside the thirteen stars a ring in-scribed with the words 'perpetual union;' within this ring the all-seeing eye, crowned with a halo; beneath this eye the American flag, bearing in its field stars equal to the number of the States united; in the folds of the bars the words, 'God, liberty, law.' This would make a beautiful coin, to which no possible citizen could object. This would relieve us from the ignominy of hea-thenism. This would place us openly under the divine protection we have personally claimed. From my heart I have felt our national shame in disowning God as not the least of our present national disasters. To you first I address a subject that must be agitated." Whether moved by this letter or not, Secretary Chase wrote as follows on November 20, a week later, to the director of the mint in Philadelphia: "No nation can be strong except in the strength of God or safe except in his defense. The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest and tersest words possible this national recognition." As it was found that the director of the mint had no authority over the mottoes to be placed on our coins, Congress having by a law passed in 1837 provided for them, he prepared his designs and submitted them to the secretary. The mottoes suggested were "Our Coun- try;" "Our God," and "God Our Trust." In reply, the secretary wrote: "I approve your mottoes, only sug-gesting that the first should begin with 'Our God,' so as to read 'Our God and Our Country,' and that the motto on the shield should be changed so as to read in-stead of 'God Our Trust,' In God We Trust."' An act passed April 22, 1864, changing the compo-sition of the 1-cent piece and authorizing the coinage of the 2-cent piece. It provided also that the devices of the coins should be fixed by the director of the mint with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. In accordance with this provision the motto "In God We Trust," was placed on the new bronze 2-cent piece. By other acts it was provided that it should be placed on certain silver and gold coins.ŠSel. Sunday Closing in New Jersey. THE MAYOR OF ENGLEWOOD CHAMPIONS THE SUNDAY LAW. New York "World," Jan. 22. MAYOR E. A. Brinkerhoff, of Englewood, recently defeated in his endeavor to close candy stores and ice-cream parlors Sunday, is now prodding the butchers and barbers. He has sent out long circulars to these business men, the contents of which astonish the mayor's most intimate friends. He says there is a little excuse for butchers doing business Sunday mornings and adds: "The barber question is not so easily disposed of, for while cleanliness is akin to godliness, a clean shave is more in the nature of a luxury than a necessity, but it is a requirement of the many and often deemed essen-tial to needed comfort." The circular then branches off thus:Š "The world is eager and active for gain, and evil connived at will soon take the reins in its own hands and bid defiance to all control; but when rightly and firmly opposed it fades away before reproof and opposi-tion. "There is a problem of Sabbath observance in every century, and the problem apparently grows more intri-cate and bewildering as with the advance of civilization it seemingly becomes a foe to Christianity. Yet the main structural principles of society are simple, and re-main the same for every age. "The great outstanding fact is that the Almighty claims one day in seven as his. The arguments for such a Sabbath are many. Those chiefly urged in public are considerations which relate to man's physical recupera-tion after the week-day toil, or to a periodic pleasuring. In the Bible view the Sabbath is not a holiday, but a holy day. "The Sunday laws, if properly and judiciously en-forced, would bring a blessing to any community, not necessarily interfering with individual rights or comfort, but giving to all the required example that the one day in seven has a divine guaranty of man's being set apart from a mere existence for toil or pleasure.
