NEW YORK, JULY 23, 1903 VOL. XVIII NO. 30 PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY Civic righteousness cannot be promoted by the enforce-ment of religion. The fact that the Sunday laws cannot and should not be literally enforced is reason enough why they should not exist. Affairs which bring about conference between Govern-ment officials as such and church officials and representa-tives as such, bring about incipient union of church and state. The Government and its officials as such should have nothing to do with church affairs; and no church and its representattbes as such should have anything to do with governmental affairs. The statute, if literally construed, is still harmonious with those times when under contemporaneous laws four Quakers were hanged on Boston Common; but it is some-what out of joint with the ideas of the year 1903. ŠSee page 475. Beaumont, Texas, June 22.ŠFor selling peanuts on Sunday, John Raino, an itinerant peanut 'vendor, was to-day fined $31.50 by Justice of the Peace B. M. Pope, and in default of payment of the same WAS REMANDED TO THE COUNTY ROAD FOR A PERIOD OF SIXTY- FIVE DAYS.ŠPress Dispatch. (On June 7 the president of the "Sunday League of America" made several "eloquent and convincing" speeches in Beaumont "upon the necessity of the observance of the Sabbath by men, cities, and nations." This case is one of the results.)
