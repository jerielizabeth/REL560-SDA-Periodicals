52o  THE SENTINEL OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY ried farther, and we have no doubt that in a short time there will be included in it, to prove that the profession of the separation of church and state under the jurisdiction Â¥of the United States is "ab-solutely and unqualifiedly false," this very matter of the sending of this mis-sion to the Vatican. These representa-tives of the Papacy know perfectly well when the principle of separation of church and state is violated, and they make it perfectly evident that if there is anything they hate, so far as the Catholic Church is concerned, it is the application of that principle. And yet there are peo-ple pretending to be very wise who are so simple as to believe that the Papacy in this country is heartily in accord with that principle. The President on the Philippine Situation The charges of inhuman conduct on the part of Americans in the Philippines was the topic to which nearly the whole of President Roosevelt's Decoration Day address at the Arlington National Cem-etery was devoted. His points in regard to this matter were, in brief, that cruel-ties had been committed ; that they were wholly exceptional, and were counter-balanced by innumerable acts of for-bearance and generous kindness; that they had been committed under terrible provocation from a very cruel and treacherous enemy which had committed one hundred times as many acts of far greater atrocity ; that, though committed in retaliation, determined and unswerv-ing efforts are being made to punish every act of barbarity and to prevent such deeds in the future; that they had been shamelessly exaggerated in this country; that "we would have been justi-fied by Abrah,am Lincoln's rules of war in infinitely greater severity than has  been shown ;" and that "the fact really is that our warfare in the Philippines has been carried on with singular humanity." In contrast with these exceptional acts of cruelty on the part of "strong men who, with blood and sweat, face years of toil and days and nights of agony, and at need lay down their lives in remote tropic jungles," for "the honor of the flag" and "the triumph of civilization over forces which stand for the black chaos of savagery and barbarism," were held up in severe and scathing terms, but not too much so, the lynchings which occur from time to time "in our country, to the deep and lasting shame of our peo-ple, lynchings carried on under circum-stances of inhuman cruelty and barbar-ity." The handling of this point seemed to be directed with the view of entirely discrediting the words of those, or some of those, who "clamor about what has been done in the Philippines," by fasten-ing upon them the odium, or at least the inconsistency, of failing to condemn these lynchings. The effectiveness of this as an answer to those who cry out against brutality in the Philippines while endorsing these lynchings in the United States is of course beyond question. But, farther than that, it was of Course not only entirely destitute of any force as an answer to the charges of cruelty, but was in a way a positive indictment of the whole attempt to subjugate the Filipinos, and strongly emphasized a peculiar odi-um which attaches to every deed of cru-elty that has occurred in that attempt. The Filipino has the best of justification for withstanding the advances of his American "liberator" and "benefactor" with the words : "Go take the beam of lynching and of fiendish holocausts from your own eye before you attempt in the name of humanity and civilization, with the might and force of conquest, to ex-tract the mote which you claim to find in
