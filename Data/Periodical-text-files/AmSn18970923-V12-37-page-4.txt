  580 AMERICAN                to save anybody by superintending the police, by run-ning the politics of cities, by regulating the affairs of th,e State, nor by any other worldly means, or method. He sought to save men only by spreading the knowledge of God and winning men to God. He did it only by ever revealing to men the Fatherly love add care of God for all mankind. When he found himself obliged to tell the scribes, the. pharisees, and the lawyers, that they were hypocrites, it was not done in a spirit of denunciation; but Rather with sorrow that such was the truth and that he was obliged to state it. It is eternal life to know God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. God desires that all men shall have eternal life. And as nothing but the knowledge of God can bring eternal life, the Lord Jesus came into the world to give to men the knowledge of God. This was his sole mission to, the world. To this one thing all the faculties and energies of his whole be!ng were devoted.. This is the sole mission of Christians in the world. Men need the knowledge of God to-day as much as when Jesus was in the world. Yet Jesus is not now in the world as he was then. But believers in him are here in his stead. These are sent as was he. And as he is do are we in this world. Christians are sent, as verily as was Jesus, to be the saviours of the worldŠnot of themselves nor by them-selves, but of God and by God. Jesus said of himself, "I can of mine own self do nothing." He did not come to save men of himself and by'himself : he came to save the world by bringing and revealing to men the knowledge of God. So likewise Christians are not sent to save men of themselves nor by themselves, nor by any ,plans or methods of their own; but by bringing to men and hold-ing before the world the knowledge of God. ThiA is the only mission, the sole purpose of existence of Christians in the world. To this one thing all their faculties and energies are devoted. And wherein any Christian comes short of this, so much he fails of being,  the Christian that Christ has sent him to be in the world. Here is the Lord's design for every believer: "Now thanks be unto God who always causeth us to triumph, and maketh manifest the savor of 1;ds knowledge by us in every place." Thus the purpose of existence of the Christian in the world, is to glorify God, to make manifest the knowledge of God in every place, and so to bring to men eternal life. And every sincere Christian shuns, as he would' a viper, anything and everything that would tend in the least degree to exalt itself against.  the knowledge of God, He brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, in whose stead he is in the world. The only per-son whom he ever has any ambition or desire to control, is himself. The only rulership he ever cares for is that over his own spirit. The only power that he ever chooses to exercise over flesh, is power over his own flesh. This is ChristianityŠthe Christianity of Christ. These are for they are like Jesus. God is seeking for such. The world needs such, that it may find the knowl- edge of God and Jesus whom he sent, and may have eternal life. " An Extraordinary Utterance.?  WHAT the New York World, of September 16, styles "an extraordinary utterance," was delivered in this city on the preceding Sunday, by a Roman Catholic priest, "Father" Ducey. He said iŠ "No law of man which conflicts with the law of God can exact obedience and submission from men. There is a higher law, as Seward said before he was stricken down for his efforts to preserve the independence of man. And we claim to-day, as moral teachers, that the higher law' still exists. And no laws passed by corruption in the in: terestsŁ of trusts and monopolies, against the interests and welfare of God's creatures in contradiction of the laws of God, are binding on the conscience of any man." The World says it feels in duty bound to protest against "the dangerous doctrine preached" in this utter-ance, and inquires:Š "What is it except an incitement to every man, no matter how ignorant or reckless, to become his own in-terpreter of the validity and the justice of laws? What practical difference is there between the anarchism of Goldman and Most, ranting against all law, and this broad assertion of the existence of a `higher law' in the consciousness of men? Who is to decide when 'the law of man so- conflicts with the law of God' as to relieve men from obedience? Is it to be Father Ducey or his hearers? And what will becOme of government or of society if this doctrine of every man his own judge is, to prevail ?" Does the World mean to deny that there is any "higher law" than the statutes of men? If so, it is most certainly in the wrong, And if there be a "higher law' which is binding upon the consciences of menŠeven the law of the Most High GodŠwhat attitude shall men assume toward it? When man's law comes in conflict with itŠas it has very often done in the history of this worldŠwho is to point out the duty of the'individual? Will the State do it? The State says, Obey my laws. But in case of a conflict between them and the law of God, the individual's duty is to the latter. There is no condition or circumstances whatso-ever under which any individual is absolved from the duty of obedience to the law of God. How then is the duty of the individual to be deter-mined? That is the'inquiry of the World. Does the in-dividual become "his own interpreter of the validity and the justice of laws?" No; not in the case of the Chris-tian; far front it. But that is the way it appears in the eye of the State. And the State usually proceects to deal with him accordingly. This is precisely what happened in the case of the martyrs who went -Co the dungeon and the stake for conscience' sake. It is the funetion of conscience to guide an individual in choosing, between right and wrong. It is not the busi-
