For the last six months of 1902, the International Sunday School Lessons are " Studies in the Old Testament."  ¥:. The lesson topics selected by the Committee cover only a portion of the Bible history ¥:¥ from the "Giving of the Manna " (the subject of the first lesson) to the time of Samuel.  ¥:.¥ ¥:. The subjects considered contain lessons of great importance, and yet they must of ¥:. ...? necessity be somewhat fragmentary, since they are ofttimes widely separated chronolog-ically. On this account some "help " covering this portion of the Bible connectedly will ff. be most valuable.  ¥:- ¥:.  Such a " help " is to be had in "PATRIARCHS AND PROPHETS." It covers the whole ¥:¥ period, not as a Bible history, but in a topical study of the most important subjects, from  ¥:¥ ¥I'¥ the entrance of sin to the time of David. It shows "Why Sin Was Permitted" and por- trays  ¥:. ¥:-in pleasing language and in a most interesting manner the controversy between the ¥:¥ forces of good¥and es il, as illustrated in the lives of "holy men of old."  ¥:. ¥:. .:¥  Nearly every lesson topic for the last half of the year is treated in this book and  ¥:- ¥:.  truths are brought out and such spiritual lessons drawn from the Scriptures, as are to be  ¥:¥ ¥:. found in no other publication. ¥:¥ ¥:.  Teachers or pupils who desire to really get the most good out of this series of lessons  ¥:. ¥;¥  cannot afford to di prive themselves of this ,' help." Each one will do well to read the  ¥:¥ book through by course during the study, thus getting a connected N iew of the events.  ¥:. ¥:. A leaflet giving references from the lesson to the pages in the book which treat on the  ¥:. same subject will be furnished with each copy of " Patriarchs and Prophets."  ¥:. ¥:. ¥:.  762 PAGES. $2.25 IN CLOTH.  ¥:, ¥:.
