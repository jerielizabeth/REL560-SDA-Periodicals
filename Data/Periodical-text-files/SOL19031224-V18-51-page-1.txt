An Indictment of New York's Sunday LawÑIX PUBLISHED WEEKLY  ONE DOLLAR A YEAR , k ) Th  e Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII  WASHINGTON, D. C., DECEMBER 24, 1903  NO. 51 The zeal for Sabbath reform 71,hich manifests itself in Sunday enforcement is 2'ery much misdirected. The fact that the enforcement of Sunday laUs is no longer and can no longer be other than discriminatory and partial is a special reason why all enforcement of those laws should cease. The " right to rest one day in seven " does not include the "right"to compel people to rest on Sunday or one day in seven, as is the selfish and vicious assumption of the champions of Sunday enforcement. c4 crusade in the interests of the " Christian Sabbath" is not one in which the machinery of the civil law should be employed, no matter what may be "the general senti-ment of the Christian people" in the matter. The competition which Sunday-enforcement clergymen are interested in suppressing is not, as they profess, the competition of the Sunday seller 7vith the Sunday closer, but the competition of Sunday traffic with Sunday worship. They wish the law to secure the church in a monopoly of the day by suppressing upon it eve  thing but the business in which the church engages.  They dare not trust the church to the competition of secular business upon her own day, and therefore demand from the state for her the sup-pression of all secular business on Sunday.
