LIBERTY the " World League of Religions," as it is even now styled, toward the little fel-lows who dare to exercise the divine right of dissent? Is there not as much and more danger in a World League of Religions as in a World League of Na-tions? Such a combination of ecclesias-tical power centralized in a Supreme Council or " Super-head " is as inimical to the welfare of Christian democracies as is a Super-government of absolute power to the welfare and independence  of political democracies. It is high time that somebody should sound a note of warning and point out the danger signals in the League of Churches as well as in the League of Nations. What are now harmless petitions may become presently relentless mandates de-manding obedience at the price of con-science or blood. Where is the balance of power that will secure us against abso-lutism ? It is gone, and servitude only remains. O "Put Them Out! Put Them Out!" By Heber H.

I rec-ognized him immediately, and my first thought was, I wonder what he is do-ing now. This was prompted, doubt-less, by the knowledge that he was at the time of our first meeting a profes-sional reformer, connected with a well-known organization. At the close of the meal, we engaged in conversation, and he handed me a card, in the corner of which I noted these words, " Representing the Biblical Alliance." My curiosity was aroused and I inquired the purpose of the " al-liance." He replied, " To place the Bi-ble in every school in the land, to have it taught in all schools ; and we will do it." I referred to the fact that some other societies held a similar aim and that years of effort had, apparently, not brought marked success. His answer came quickly : " But we will do it. They have all started at the wrong end. We are beginning with the universities, in-tend to take the colleges next, then the high schools, and finally the grade schools." I asked what would be done with teachers who, though hard workers,  did not happen to believe in the Scrip-tures. " Put them out ! put them out ! " was his rejoinder. Without further encouragement, he told me of his plan of campaign and what the society he represents hopes ul-timately to achieve. He said, in part : " Mr.  and I have been in the adjoining county just a week. We ar-ranged with churches to have the ladies furnish suppers, and we paid them the exact cost of the same. We gave ad-dresses, Mr. Å  speaking first and dwelling upon patriotism, thus prepar-ing the way for me. I explained the nature of our campaign, and secured the promises of many to back our project.  We secured $1,500 in cash also. Not bad was it ? I intended to return there and bind the interested ones into a more solid organization before passing on to other counties. We are keeping quiet now, and do not purpose taking any action till we have fifty or sixty counties well organized with thousands of mem-bers; then we may call a State conven-tion. In the past the Catholics and Jews have opposed this movement, but we will be ready for them this time. We will elect men to the legislature on the issup
