PUBLISHED WEEKLI ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, JANUARY 29, 1903 NO. 5 "The immortal Lincoln's definition of a republic-  is the best that can ever be given: 'A gobernment of the people, by the people, and for the people.' A republic is a government OF THE PEOPLEŠthe people compose the gobernment. The people are goberned BY THE PEOPLEŠby themselbes. They are governed by the people FOR THE PEOPLEŠthey are governed by themselves for themselbes. Such a government is but self-got ernment; each citizen governs himself by himselfŠby his own powers of self-restraint; and he does this for himself, for his own good, for his own best interests. In proportion as; this conception is not ful-filled, in proportion as the people lose the power of govern-ing themselves, in the same proportion the true idea of a republic will fail of realization. And whenever in a repub-lic the majority of the people fail to govern themselves the republic is gone in principle, and it remains but a mere matter of time when it will be found to be gone in practise Šsucceeded by a government not of the people, but of the few, and at last of only one."
