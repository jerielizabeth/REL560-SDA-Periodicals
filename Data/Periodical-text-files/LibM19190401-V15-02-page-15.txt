PEACE, IN WASHINGTON'S " WELCOME HOME " PARADE, FEB. 27, 1919 of the World liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The enjoyment of liberty is the most precious boon in this life. The gift f life without the gift of liberty would be but .bject slavery. No person can be truly happy as Dng as he and.  others are in bondage. Conse-neatly the greatest of all earthly blessings and nalienable political rights is liberty. Our great and glorious nation is the only nation bat ever guaranteed in its fundamental law lib-rty in its fullest and truest sense. Here democ-acy has come into full bloom and has yielded its lost benign fruitage. It is a government of the eople, by the people, and for 'the people. The eople know no masters and no rulers but such as hey themselves choose. Immediate and final sov-reignty rests with the people.
