THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 75 "I have often expressed my opinion, that every man who conducts himself as a good citi-zen is,  accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should . be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own con-science." We say again, that in the words, "Render therefore unto Ctesar the things which are Cmsar's; and unto God the things which are God's," Matt. 22 : 21, Christ separated forever the civil from the religious power. And the National Reform party in its endeavor to join them, clearly sets itself against the word of Christ. But the National Reform idea of the work of the gospel is as crude as its idea of the relation of the civil and the religious power. Mrs. Woodbridge says further:Š " An amendment to the National Constitu-tion requires the endorsement of two-thirds of the States, to become law. Although the ac-tion must be taken by State Legislative bodies, let such an amendment be submitted, and it would become the paramount issue 'at the elec-tion of legislators, and thus God would be in the thought, and his name upon the lip of every man. May not this be the way opened to us? How to bring the gospel of Christ to the masses, has been, and is, the vexing prob-lem or the church. Would not the problem be solved? . . . In considering the submis-sion of such an amendment, we may use the very argument used by Moses, in his song con-taining these words of Jehovah, For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land.' How prayerfulness would be stimulated! Conscience would press the words, 'If the Lord be God, follow him, but if Baal, then follow him.' Then would there be searchings of heart, as David's, of which we learn in the fifty-first Psalm. Prayer would bring faith and the power of the Spirit: and when such power shall rest upon the children of God, there will be added to the church daily such as shall be saved." ' Oh yes! to be sure! What a most excellent method of bringing the gospel (?) to the masses! Most assuredly the problem would be solved. This scheme has been tried, and the problem solved, before, and in much the same way. By making the subject of the Trinitarian contro-versy a national and governmental issue the name of God ,and of Christ was "upon every lip," clubs, stones, or military weapons, in the hands, and murder in the heart, of every man. Thus the gospel was brought to the masses, and so there was added to the church daily such as should be  " . Especially in the city of Rome, by this means, the masses became so devout, that in the most exciting and deci- sive moment of a horse-race, the whole multi-tude in, the vast circus could in an instant turn their minds to the gospel (?) and shout " One God, One -Christ, One Bishop." And, by the way, the women were among the leaders, and were the main help in bringing about this tri- umph of the goSpel among the masses at a horse-race in the Roman circus. Thus, in that age, was the gospel brought to the masses; thus, then, was the problem solved. And ." his-tory repeats itself," even to the part the women play in the political project of bringing the gos-pel to the masses.ŠSee Gibbon's Decline and Fall, chap. 21, par. 35. But illustrations are hardly needed to show how entirely foreign to the gospel of Christ are  such propositions and such arguments as we here present from the Chautauqua National Reform Speech. Such stuff needs but to be read to be con-demned utterly by every one who has any re- spect for the gospel or for its Author. But if the reading of this is not enough to condemn both it and the cause in behalf of which it must be used, then we shall insert just one more sentence from the very midst of when,ce these are copied. Immediately following the words, " Would not the problem be solved?" are these:Š Yea, Christ would then be lifted up, even as the serpent in the wilderness, and would we not have right to claim the fulfillment of the promise, that 'He will draw all men unto him-self? '" To think of a political campaign managed by ambitious clerics, political hypocrites, ward pol-iticians, and city bosses, and call that bringing the gospel of Christ to the masses, and the means of adding to the church daily such as shall be saved, is certainly a conception of the gospel of Christ which is degrading enough in all conscience. But when to cap such a con-ception, it is avowed that such would be the lifting up of Christ, even as the serpent in the wilderness, and the fulfillment of the promise that he will draw all men unto him, the -whole idea becomes one that is vastly nearer to open blasphemy than it is to the proper conception of the gospel of Christ. But such, and of such, is the gospel of National Reform. A. T. J. The American Constitution. THE folloWing magnificent tribute to the Constitution of our country is from Bancroft's " History of the Formation of the Constitution." And this is the charter of human liberty and natural right with which the National Reform-ers are displeased, and which they are deter- mined to subvert. Such a wish can spring from nothing else than a desire to exercise a power that is in violation of the natural rights of man-kind:Š "The Constitution establishes nothing that interferes with equality and individuality. it knows nothing of differences by descent, or opinions of favored classes, or legalized religion, or the political power of property. It leaves the individual alongside of the individual. No nationality of character could take form, ex-cept on the principle of individuality, so that the mind might be free, and every faculty have the unlimited opportunity for its development and culture. As the sea, is made up of drops, American society is composed of separate, free, and constantly moving atoms, ever in recipro-cal action, advancing, receding, crossing, strug-gling against each other and with each other; so that the institutions and laws of the countfy rise out of the masses of individual thought, which, like the waters of the ocean, are rolling evermore. " The rule of individuality was extended as never before. The Synod of the Presbyterians of New York and Philadelphia, a denomination inflexibly devoted to its own creed, in their tinction between C:eSar and God, between that which is Ceasar!s and that which is God's; that is, between the civil and the religious power, and between what we owe to the civil power and what we owe to the religious power. We owe to Caesar, the civil power, that which is civil: we owe to God, the religious power, that which is religious. This is the distinction which God, in Christ, has absolutely fixed. Whoever seeks to confound this distinction is against God and against Christ; to join, or to seek to join, the religious with the civil power is to confound the distinction; and to join the religious with the civil power is precisely what the National Reform party proposes to do. The logical conclusion from this is clear, and we do not hesitate to say that it is strictly accor-ding to Scripture and, therefore, perfectly true. For the State to enforce religious duties it thereby demands that to Csar shall be ren- dered that which is God's, and therefore it usurps the place of God, and so far as it is obeyed, it destroys the true worship of God. We know the claim that the.se men make, as of all of their kind in the dreadful history of per- secution everywhere, that is, that it is the true worship of God and of Christ which they ask that the civil power shall enforce, and this ac- cording to the Bible. But no such thing can be done. Christ did not say that we should render to Caesar that which is God's; neither did he say that we should render to God by Ccesar that which is God's. That which is God's is his, and we are to render it to him di-rect, without any of the meddling naediumship of Csar. When we have rendered to Cesar that which is Cmsar's, we have rendered to Caesar all his due and he has no right to de-mand any more. And when he haS so received his just due on all his proper claims, then -what business is it of Ctesar's how we render to God that which is God's or whether we render it at all or not?ŠIt is just none of his business. And when he seeks to make it his business he is meddling with that which in no wise con-cerns him. One of the unbecoming and irrev-erent results of such action is well expressed by Gibbon, in speaking of Constantine and his sons:Š " Those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith, as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects; . . . . and the prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled, or changed, or modified, in the cabinet of an earthly monarch."ŠDecline and Fall, chap. R1, par. 16. Could anything possibly be more incongru-ous ! It is just such incongruity that these words of Christ are intended forever to pre- vent. Yet history is full of it, and, while our own Government has escaped it. so far, now the National Reform party seeks by the subversion of the Constitution to inflict it upon this great Nation. Whenever the civil power steps between a man and God and proposes to regulate just what shall be rendered to God and just how it shall be rendered, then Cmsar is entirely out of his place. George Washington was a man for whose opinions we suppose there is yet remain-ing some respect on the part of Americans, and he said:Š
