      Lil                          ' Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Leviticus 25 10. VOL. XII FOURTH QUARTER, 1917 NO. 4 Senator Sheppard's Historic Speech on a Historic Occasion By the Editor ON July 3o, 1917, Senator Morris Sheppard, of Texas, made the opening speech in the United States Senate, favoring a Constitutional amendment for nation-wide prohibition. The joint resolution providing for the submission of such an amendment to the various State legislatures for ratification was passed by the. Senate on the fol-lowing day, 65 Senators voting for it, and 20 against it. This is the first time the Senate has acted favorably on such a resolution. There is no doubt in the minds of those who seem to be familiar with the sentiment prevailing in the House of Representatives, that the House will speedily concur in this action. The resolution limits the States to six years' time for this amendment to be either approved or rejected by three fourths of the States. This important question is being referred to the people as the final tribunal. The will of the whole people will thus become the su-preme law, and there is no question as to how the people will vote on this issue. C Harris & Ewing SENATOR MORRIS SHEPPARD Senator Sheppard's notable address was, in part, as follows : ≈Å " Mr. President, this is a historic oc-casion. For the first time in its annals the Senate is to vote on the submission of a Constitutional amendment for na-tion-wide prohibition. The method or-dained by the federal Constitution for its own alteration is being strictly fol-lowed: If the proposed amendment should be adopted by three fourths of the States, the traffic in intoxicating liq-uors for beverage purposes would be forbidden anywhere within the American Republic. Prohibition would be embed-ded in the organic law of the nation. " At the outset an inquiry may arise 99
