   THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. 37                 set on foot by the National, Reform Asso-ciation to: secure such an amendment is unscriptural-  also. "Moreover a principal object, undoubt-edly the oprineipal object, National Re-formers have hi view when demanding the establishment of the Christian as the State religion, is the furtherance and pro-motion of it ; they want to make the State subservient to the interests of the Church; they want_ to advance the cause of Chris-tianity by the aid and at the expense of the State. . . . The kingdom of Christ is not to be advanced or sustained through the' aid of the civil power, but through the word of God and through the procla-mation of that word. Christ, when send-ing his apostles out into the world did not say to them; 'plant in.y church and extend its limits by calling to your assist-ance the Civil magistrates in the different countries of the globe;' but what did he say ? He spoke very plainly to them on this point. He said, 'Go ye into all the world,' and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is bap-tized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be. damned.' Mark 16: 15, 16. Compare also Matt. 28 : 19, 20. " The preaching of the gospel and the' administration of the holy sacraments, and the divine institution of the ministry, are the 'divinely appointed 'means through which Christ establishes, advances, and preserves his Church upon earth. And these means contain in themselves the sufficiency for the accomplishment of what they are to accomplish. The 'em-ployment of every other : means for the establishment and preservatien of the Church of Christ is an insult offered to the Son of God, and is virtually declaring that the means furnished by Christ are insuf-ficient: Requesting and demanding of civil government to further the interests of Christianity is therefore unscriptural; consequently the agitation to secure a constitutional amendment to this affect is miscriptural, and such an amendment, if secured, would be unscriptural also." -Ł Ł The Right Ring. THE Los Angeles Churchman, a monthly periodical, devoted to the interests of the Episcopal Church in Southern California, is doing some good work in opposition to so-called National Reform and American Sabbath Unionism. The following, from the December number, will bear repeat-ing:Š " For sterling honesty and common business sense, with a clear conception of the proper functions of civil government, we commend the late message of Mayor Hazard to the Council on the Sunday-closing ordinance. It has the right ring. " The Mayor may have erred in judg-ment in not signing the ordinance at once,  we think he did, but that he is right on the matter of Sunday closing we have not a shadow of doubt. " We want to see the saloons closed every day; we want them utterly abolished from the land, but not to go to the root of the matter, to have them closed merely on Sunday under penalty of fine and im-prisonment to satisfy the clamor of relig-ionists, is a piece of Puritan fanaticism which is plainly branded with the mark of the beast of religious tyranny, the worst of all tyrants, and the deadly foe of free and enlightened civilization. " The saloons are not only the flag of distress of a people possessed of the devil, they are also the sign of the Church's sin of covetousness, and consequent divine impotency. The saloons in any city would all be closed within a year if the Christians within it would do their duty to their brother men as Christians. Bad as the saloons are they are not so bad as modern Christianity trying to hide its shame and sin under the cloak, of Sunday laws. " We want the Nazarene in the modern temple to cry : ' Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ! ' " Ł Ł Ł  The Baptists and Religious Liberty. EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN SENTINELŠDear Sir: In your issue of December 18, 1890, you quoted some " sound opinions " from a Baptist paper, in reference to relig-ious instruction in the public schools. I have always admired the sound principles of the Baptist Church ; and that the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL may receive further instruction from the Baptists in reference to religious liberty, I send for publication the following selections, copied from works written by Baptist ministers, and published for years by the Baptist Publishing House, No. 1420 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia :Š The struggle for religious liberty was already begun when the Apostles Peter and John stood before the Jewish council of elders and rulers, and declared, "whether it be right, in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye; for we can-not but speak the things which we have seen and heard."Š Early Struggles for Religious Liberty. In 1611, nine years before the landing of the Pil-grims, two significant events occurred in EnglandŠthe publication of the present English version of the Bible, and the publication of articles of faith by En-glish Baptists reiterating the doctrine of religions liberty which had been taught by their brethren at the beginning of the Reformation, eighty years before, and reasserted in England fifty-one years before, say-ing that "the magistrate is not to meddle with religion or matters of conscience, nor compel men to this or that form of religion, because Christ is the King and Lawgiver of the Church and conscience. In March, 1639, Williams became a Baptist, and was baptized by one of his own members; and then he in turn baptized others,Š somewhat irregular, it is true, but from necesSity. Thus was organized the first Baptist Church in America. . . . Roger Williams, in 1643, went to England, taking ship from New York, because banished from Boston. In March, 1644, he obtained the charter for the Colony of Rhode Island, with power for the Colony to make its own laws; and in September, 1644, under that charter was established the first government on earth that granted full re-ligious liberty. Some Baptist ministers?  as in Aceoma0 County,  were arrested and imprisoned as vagrants; 'some were pulled down - from the stands, insulted and whipped, and many were imprisoned for preaching the gospel not according to the established church. . While thus confined they preached through the grated windows of their prisons to crowds who gath-ered around. The father of Henry Clay was thus imprisoned, as a Baptist minister, in Virginia, as T was informed by Rev. Porter Clay, a brother of Henry Clay. They even accused the Baptists of trying to break up the Union, when they merely asked for religious liberty.Š The Trials and Victories of Religions Liberty in America. By Rev. G. S. Bailey, P.P., 1776.ŠA Cen-tennial Memorial, 1876, pp. 12, 22, 23, 40. Gradually, by the persecutions, the preaching, and the principles of Baptists, many others were con-vinced and enlisted. James Madison lived among them, witnessed their sufferings, was one of the ad-vocates engaged by them, and throughout was em-ployed to prepare memorials, advocate bills and other measures, and sustain the cause of conscience, and he did it well and from the heart. Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson were also among those engaged in this cause of religious liberty. The General Asso-ciation of Virginia Baptists appointed commissioners to attend the' sessions of the State Legislature and conventions. They employed counsel, engaged attor-neys, sent supplies to prisoners and their families, and gave no rest from their memorials, remonstrances,, petitions, and appeals. The "General Committee" was busy year after year in the work. They demanded the abolition of the established church; no taxation whatever for religion; no privileges; no compulsion for any, but free, full, and permanent liberty of con-science for all. They proclaimed their old doctrine of centuries.ŠReligions Liberty and the Baptists. By Rev. C. C. Bitting, Pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Richmond, Va., pp. 48, 49. It is recorded by Dr. John M. Peck, that about the year 1770, when three Baptist ministers were to be tried at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Patrick Henry, the great orator, rode some sixty miles to attend the trial, and unexpectedly entered the court-room as the in-dictment was being read. He listened as they were accused "of preaching the gospel of the Son of God," contrary to Virginia law. When the indictment had been read, and the prosecuting attorney opened the case, Patrick Henry, having glanced over the indict-ment, arose and addressed the Court :Š " May it please your worships: I think I heard read by the prosecutor, as I entered this house, the Taper I hold in my hand. If I have rightly understood, the king's attorney of this Colony has framed an indict-ment for the purpose of arraigning and punishing by imprisonment three inoffensive men, before the bar of this court, for a crime of great magnitude, as dis-turbers of the peace. May it please the Court, what did I hear read? Did I hear it distinctly, or was it a mistake of my own'? Did I hear an expression as if a crime, that these men are charged with f What! 'For preaching the gospel of the Son of God'?" Swinging the indictment three times around his head, he ex-claimed: "Great God! May it please your worships, in a day like this, when Truth is about to burst its fetters, when mankind are about to be aroused to claim their natural and inalienable rights; when the yoke of op-pression that has reached the wilderness of America, and the unnatural alliance of ecclesiastical and civil power are about to be dissolved; at such a period, when libertyŠliberty of conscienceŠis about to awake from her slumberings and inquire into the reason of such charges as I find exhibited here to-day in this indict-ment.! . . . Our fathers left the land of their nativity for settlement in these American wilds, for liberty,Šfor civil and religious liberty,Š for liberty of con-science,Š to worship their Creator according to their conceptions of Heaven's revealed will. . . . They placed their feet on the American continent, and in its deeply imbedded forests sought an asylum from persecution and tyranny. . . Heaven decreed that men should be free,Š free to worship God according to the Bible. Were it not for this, in vain have been the efforts and sacrifices of the colonists, in vain were all their suffer-ings and bloodshed to subjugate this New World, if we, their offspring, must still be oppressed and perse-cuted!
