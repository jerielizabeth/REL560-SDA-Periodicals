JUNE 20, 1895. _AIME  1[1:1L-C.I4C 199 books laws which throw in the shade the old `Blue Laws of ConnecticutŠlaws which are a shame and a disgrace to the States which per-mit them to remain on their statute books, and a sad commentary upon the boasted civil-ization of the nineteenth century. We allude to the so-called Sunday laws, which infringe upon the rights of conscience and prevent Men from following the forms of worship prescribed by the church to which they adhere and give their allegiance. These laws are unequal in their operation; they are, in the States named above, used to oppress a certain religious sect which believes that the more ancient statute is not obsolete: " Six days shalt.thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." Shah is the belief of the religious sect known as Seventh-day Adventists, comprising a large number of influential men and women in the several States of the Union. Less than two months ago the Evening Press directed attention to an outrage per-petrated in Tennessee; the trial, conviction, and imprisonment of a number of gentlemen who worshiped God on the seventh day of the week and pursued their ordinary and necessary Vocations on the first day of the week, com-monly recognized as Sunday and, by some called the Sabbath. These gentlemen refused to stultify themselves and went to prison for conscience' sake. Subsequently they were pardoned, but that does not alter the fact that they were unjustly and inhumanly dealt With, under a statute instigated and passed at the behest of bigots. Now we have another case of atrocious per-Seentfon to chronicle: the conviction of J. Q. Allison, of Douglasville, Ga., for violating the Sabbath statute of that State, and his sentence to-  serve in the chain-gang. The Georgia law provides that the offender may "be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, imprisonment not to exceed six months, to Work iii-the chain-gang on the public works, or on such other works as the county authori= ties may employ the chain-gang, not to exceed twelve.  months, and any one or more of these punishments may be ordered at the discretion of the judge." Section 4582 of the Georgia Code makes the following provisions for its disposal:Š All moneys arising from fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consists in their being committed on the Sabbath day, shall be paid to the ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath schools in the county. There are other provisions of this atrocious law which are even worse than those quoted above, but which we have not the space to quote in full. Suffice it to say that there is within the possible limit of the law, first, a thousand-dollar fine; second, six months' im-prisonment; third, the chain-gang; fourth, all three combined; fifth, he faces the possi-bility of being hired out to the highest bidder, to some contractor, and in either case whether in the chain-gang of the State or the private contractor, should he refuse to work on the Sabbath (Saturday), as he surely would, he "may be punished with death!" Another case comes to us from Mississippi. On May 9, at Arnory in that State, R. T. Nash was arrested for hoeing in his garden on Sunday.
