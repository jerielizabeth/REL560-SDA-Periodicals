"Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." Lev. 25: 10. Vol.. VII THIRD QUARTER, 1912 No. 3 History and Meaning of the Declaration of Independence SANFORD B. HORTON IT has been well said that the Decla-ration of  Independence ought to be known by heart by every boy and girl in America. Not many years ago one of the features of a fourth of July cele-bration thought to be necessary was the reading in full of the " immortal Decla-ration ; " but to-day we are confronted with the regrettable fact that noise and self-indulgence are more in evidence on July 4 than are patriotic joy and thank-fulness for the blessings of liberty in-herited from America's founders. Shortly after the adoption of the Dec-laration of Independence by the colonial congress, John Adams wrote a letter to his wife, in which he said : " I am apt to believe that it [the day] will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be com-memorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forevermore."

When we call to mind the history of the colonial struggle for liberty, and the reasons actuating the adoption of the Declaration, the fourth of July will mean more to us than simply an occasion of noise and self-indulgence ; for while the Declaration had to do primarily with colonial relations then existing with the mother country, under the reign of George III, yet in this document were proclaimed principles of eternal charac-ter which have served as the beacon-light of the nations in their march toward free government,Š government of the people, by the people, for the people. Ilislorica. The Declaration of Independence was the outgrowth of the spirit of independ-ence which was taking fast hold of the colonial patriots. Several declarations had been written and adopted before July 4, 1776. The people of North Car-olina claim some warrant to priority of action in the matter of independence.
