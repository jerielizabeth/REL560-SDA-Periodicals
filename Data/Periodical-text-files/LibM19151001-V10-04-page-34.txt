176 LIBERTY Copyright Underwood & Underwood, New York IN THE TRENCHES AT ST. ELOI, WHERE THE FIERCEST HAND-TO-HAND ENCOUNTER OF THE GREAT WAR TOOK PLACE Law means force. The object of Sun-day laws is to compel men to keep Sun-day. Those who, from conscientious scruples, cannot do so, are treated by their fellows as criminals. They are taken to the courts, prosecuted, and fined. Thus they are deprived of their prop- erty or their liberty simply because they cannot agree with some of their neigh-bors on matters of religion. This is cruel. It is religious persecution. Thus we find that on every count, Sun-day legislation stands condemned. Sun-day laws cannot make men love Sunday.
