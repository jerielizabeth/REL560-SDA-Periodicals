The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL, XVIII NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 24, 1903 NO. 39 The religious training of the young is a religious, not a civic, obligation. Neither church nor state can be benefited by an attempt to teach religion in state schools; the true interests of both forbid such an attempt. Those churchmen who contend that the state should undertake the teaching of religion should tell us what the church exists for. If it is the business of the state to look after the religious interests of society, then the church has no reason for existence. The fact that secular education alone is not complete education, and that religious training is necessary for the full development of mind and character, does not prove that the state should teach religion. It shows that the giving of a complete education and the 'work of fully developing mind and character exceed the functions of the state. "The prerogative of religious instruction is in the church, and it must remain in the church; in the nature of things it cannot be farmed out to the secular school without degenerating into a mere deism without a living Providence, or else changing the public school into a parochial school and destroying the efficiency of secular instruction."
