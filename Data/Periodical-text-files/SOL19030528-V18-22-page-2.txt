J do Ł e "THE TWO REPUBLICS" is a comparative study of the underlying principles of the two greatest RepublicsŠRome and the United States. '"The principle of Rome in all its phases iOliat 'religion and gOvernment are insepa-rable. The principle of the governmentof the finited States is that teligion is essentially distinct and wholly separate froth civil government, and'entirely exempt from its cog-nizance. "As it was Christianity that first and always antagonized this governmental principle of Rome, and established the governmental principle of the.l.initeli States of America,. 'the fundamental idea, the one thread-thought of the whole book, is to develop the princi-ples of Christianity with reference to civil government, and to portray the mischievous results of the least departure from those .prificiples." . Rome occupies one extreme and the United States the other. Which is right? The question interests every reader of THE SENTINEL, for in its solution and the correct appli-cation of the principles lies the salvation of individual as well as nation. "Two Republics" contains 895 octa`bo pages and is substantially bound in cloth. Price, postpaid, $1.75. Complete catalog of publications mailed on request.
