  THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY. 485             "`Yes, indeed. And of course you know who dis-covered America?' "`Yes, sir. Columbia, sir.' " Well, nearly. ColumbusŠcan you tell me his first name?' "`Yes, sir.' " What is it ? ' " Flail.' " To offset this slip, the class was instructed to sing the song in mention, and their performance was beyond cavil; so hearty, so musical were their fresh young voices, and so inexhaustible were their memoriesŠverse after verse rippling spontaneously forth, never a book in sight ! " Do you like to sing patriotic songs ?" " YES SIR!' this in a thundering chorus. " Better than other songs ? ' "`YES, SIR!' " Why ? ' " The chorus was silenced. After a pause a bullet-headed, philosophical young Teuton said, with the slowness characteristic of a deep thinker, For pecause dey makes de piggest noise.' " What do you mean by patriotic, by patriot-ism ? ' was naturally the next question. " Putting flags on your house when somebody dies.' "`Getting a half holiday and going down town to holler at the soldiers as they go by.' "' Patriotism 's killin' Spaniards.' " These definitions were given by boys to the dis-gust of a tiny girl, who jumped up with an indig-nant pipe of, Patriotism is love of your country.' "The teacher, who, as might be expected, was not thoroughly enjoying herself, beamed approval at little miss ; but the examiner felt an unshaken pride in his own sex, for the reason that the boys' answers published the fact that with them patriotism was synonymous with action. "`What has your country ever done for you that you should love it ? ' was the next question. " Oddly enough, this simple query was a poser. A timid girl remarked that her country had given her an exquisitionŠsomething evidently very horri-, ble, for she promptly put her head down upon her desk and howled with grief, utterly refusing to ex-plain herself. " The blank, not to say terrified, faces of the young-sters forced the teacher from the subordinate part of listner to controller, and rising majestically from her seat, she commanded, Children, mention five advan-tages you derive from being Amercan citizens!' "With immediate cordiality they chanted in chorus, Liberty, protection at home and abroad, self-government, free schools, and public libraries!' "We couldn't have touched the right button. En- couraged at such unanimous knowledge, we probed it a little and elicited the facts that liberty meant being out of jail, that you got protection if you could find a policeman, and that self-government was do-ing as you pleased. " We now asked our victims if they would write for us a verse or two of their favorite patriotic song, and they made no objection, appearing even to like the employment. * * * Before comment-ing upon the papers handed in to us, we wish to pre-sent a significant statistic or two: The average age of this class was ten years and one month; in their last spelling review they had taken a percentage of eighty-eight; and they were now allowed to write the song of their own choosing. The Star-Spangled Banner' seemed to be a general favorite, but cer-tainly not through the merit of being understood; for, from the very beginning, where dawn's early light' varied from the harmless shibboleth of don selery eye ' to the more sinister darn surly lie,' every line was garbled and twisted into some startling gro-tesqueness, the whole ending with an agonized ap-peal, Oh, say does the star, spangled Banner get weighed? or the home of the free? or the land of the brave?' A simple line in the second stanza, blest with victory and peace,' appeared once less the fig trees and peas'; and another time, bless with big trees apiece'; while the stanza concluded by asking politely,' Does the star Spangled Banner yet wade? "' * * * While it is natural that young children should fall into such mistakes as these more easily than older pupils, this can be no excuse for the system of train-ing that allows such vital errors of thought to go un-discovered and uncorrected. Such training can never inculcate patriotism of a higher sort than that which is synonymous with mere parade and noise or with " killin' Spaniards." This is not the patriotism of the American Constitution or the Declaration of Independence. True patriotism, as embodied in these great documents, is the love of right principles, the love of justice and freedom for all men, the spirit of liberty holding aloft her beacon enlighten- ing the world. True patriotism is respect for all the rights of our neighbors and of all other men in every place. To this cause the American nation was dedi-cated at its birth, and to it THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY is devoted to-day. The principles of this true patriotism are simple, self-evident truths, suited to the comprehension even of children. Let these principlesŠthese self-evident truths set forth in the great Declaration-Tbe taught to the children in the schools, and not some mere
