The above is the title of a treatise written by the author at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a dis-cussion upon the present aspect and aims of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as the Papacy, or Vaticanism, is outlined in the prophecies of Holy Scriptures with sufficient accuracy to determine what the "Papacy" is, and what is to be its future devel-opment and ultimate end.

The New Enlarged and Authorized Edition of that Remarkable Work, THE CHRISTIAN'S SECRET OF A HAPPY LIFE.  This Work, the demand for which has been so great as to wear out two sets of plates, has now been put in entirely new form. The book having become an accepted classic in devotional literature, it was thought wise to issue this new edition in a compact form, and in a variety of bindings. Oc-casion has also been taken by the author to thor-oughly revise the whole,work, besides adding con-siderable new matter. Few Books of a Religious Character have been accorded such Hearty and Universal Indorsement. " To commend this work would seem almost superfluous; and yet to young Christians who may not know it, we can not refrain from saying, Buy this book, and keep it with your Bible for constant study, until you have thoroughly mastered, in your own experience, the ' secret ' of which it tells. It will trans-form the dark days of your life, as it has transformed those of thousands before you, into days of heavenly light."ŠNew York Evangelist.
