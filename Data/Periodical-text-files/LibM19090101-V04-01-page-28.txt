LIBERTY Is Liberty Imperiled? ALLEN MOON LIBERTY to worship God according to the dictates of one's conscience is the gift of God. Our fathers fled from the Old World for a place in the wilderness of the New, that they might enjoy liberty of conscience. Their chil-d r en established a government base d upon principles de-signed forever to safeguard this liberty. This govern-ment, in its funda-( mental law, recog-nized the right of every man to believe o r not to be-lie v e, to worship o r not to wor-ship, and pro-tected ever y man in that right.

Speaking at this congress, and for the society, Hon. W. Bourke Cockran, of the House of Representatives at Washing-ton, is reported to have said The church is the true ally of the state. They can not be separated Å never, so long as democratic governments are relied upon to rule men. It is true that their organizations may be separate, but they are inherently inseparable and inter-dependent. It is true that the state needs no longer the support of the church; but under democratic government, the church must ever be the mainstay of the state. It is time that there should be a plain, clear, unmistakable, unanswerable
