I have had a Munson typewriter n constant use for over a year, and consider it in many respects, the best typeWriter in the market. It is small, light and compact. It is as handsome as a watch, and looks more like an ornament than a thing of use. The Munson will do anything that any other will do, and as quickly and well, if not quicker and better. J. A. WALDRON, Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, New York City. After a year's use of the Munson typewriter, I heartily pronounce it as being unexcelled by any machine in the market. In the direction of clearness and beauty of type, and alignment, it is without a rival. L. J. LIVELY, Manager, D. Appleton & Co., Chicago The Munson is certainly the equal of any machine for speed and general efficiency as an office machine; and when it comes to traveling there is nothing like it. DR. E. J. WAGGONER, London, England. I like the Munson machine very much. It is doing me good service, and I can recommend it to all who want a typewriter. 0. A. OLSEN, Pres. S. D. A. Gen, Conf., Battle Creek, Mich. I would not exchange my Munson typewriter for any typewriter on the market. L. C. CHADWICK, Pres. I. T. & M. Soc., Bridgtown, Barbadoes.

We shall await with some in-terest the developments in the case. THE committee on privileges and elections of the Legislature of South Carolina is confessedly bring-ing its individual religious opinions into the legisla-tive proceedings of the State, as witness the follow-ing taken from a press report from Columbia, S. C., December 5:Š Representative Blease inadvertently admitted that the committee on privileges and elections had formulated a report on Sunday. Representative McWhite pounced on hirif and said this was a stigma on the House and State, and that such legis-lation was inoperative. Mr. Blease replied that the committee met as individual citizens and that they were responsible at the bar of heaven. This last clause is very true; but at the bar of heaven the responsibility for the legislative en-forcement of religious observance will be found to be very heavy. THE Mail and Express says:Š The reign of lawlessness in Chicago is the direct result of the efforts of the Exposition authorities in that city to break down the Sabbath. By this is meant, that, because of the course of the Bard of Managers of the Exposition in asking Congress to repeal its Sunday closing proviso, the protection of divine Providence is being withdrawn from Chicago, and the city given up to lawlessness and violence. That is a sample of what will be said more and more by those religionists whose opinions the Mail and Express voices. Evil men and seducers will multiply in numbers, and vio-lence and lawlessness increase, pestilence and physical disaster will come upon the earth. We have the words of the apostles and of Revelation for this. The Mail and Express and all its fellows are ready with their explanation. Should the industrial discontent, already threat-ening, break out next summer while millions of people are away from their homes, in Chicago and on their way to and from, and the wheels of travel be suddenly stopped, and cholera add its terrors to the turmoil, it is easy to see where the Mail and Express would find the cause of it all. Although this particular catastrophe may not happen, things similar will, and that fanatical explanation will be given for them and considered sufficient. Then will come the cryŠ" Who is the Jonah? Over-board with him!" A DESPATCH from Elizabeth, N. J., says, that on Sunday, Dacember 4, " William H. Moffett under-took to have an auction sale of buildings at North Elizabeth, and in order to draw a crowd he hired a band of music and also had a free lunch spread on the grounds. Chief of police Tenny, by order of Mayor Rankin, raided the crowd, which numbered about three hundred, and arrested the agent and his two clerks. Augustus Salsfield, the caterer, who runs a Paterson hotel, was pulled in, and also the band of fifteen musicians. " The prisoners were marched to police head-quarters. Lawyer Foster M. Voorhees was sent for to defend them, and Justice Helfield held a special session of court, at which eighteen prison-ers were arraigned. They pleaded guilty to dis-orderly conduct, and were fined $3.85. each." Would it have been disorderly conduct to have held this sale on any other day of the week? If not, why was it disorderly to hold it on Sunday? If it was disorderly to sell houses on Sunday, why was it not disorderly to hold a session of court and transact the business of the court? If Sunday was desecrated by the sale of houses, but not by the holding of the court, was it a civil court or an ec-clesiastical council? If an ecclesiastical council, how did it come within its province to fine and im-prison for selling houses? Who can not see the hopeless tangle, and where it begins?
