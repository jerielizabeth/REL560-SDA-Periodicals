But this ideal has had many obsta-cles to overcome, and for a time made slow progress even among leading Protestant Reformers. Some understood imperfectly the great principles of human liberty and religious freedom, and others who understood, only partially obeyed these principles when they were intrusted with power. It seems strange that men could not see that Christ, in his teachings and practice, had separated the church and the state. and that  he esteemed the individual as of paramount worth. The words, " Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's," spoken to the individual, put a divine sep-arating wall between these two realms Å the civil and religious. What Christ has thus separated no man has any right to join together. A failure to recognize a distinc-tion between civil and religious obligations has been the primary cause of all the re-ligious persecutions that ha;,re cursed the world and shamed religion. But there have been a few men who saw and recognized this plain dividing line be-tween civil and divine concerns. Some of these lived and wrought even before the dawn of the great Protestant Reformation. Marsilius of Padua published a book, " De-fensor Pacis," in 1324, in which he sep-arated the church and state entirely, and held that the state should have no religious Religion ngacre
