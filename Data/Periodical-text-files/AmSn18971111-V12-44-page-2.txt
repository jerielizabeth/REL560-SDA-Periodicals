 690 AMERICAN SENTINEL.      this statement makes it worse even than we had thought. We had never before conceived of the chaplain's duty as being that of casting a halo about the business of killing people. Unquestionably the soldier's business is one that will admit of a service of this kind. There is no natural halo about it, certainly. To deliberately shoot down men, made in the image of the Creator, to smash their skulls with clubbed muskets in fierce hand-to-hand conflict, to cut and stab them to death with sword and bayonet, to pour their life blood out upon the earth, to make widows and orphans of those they have left at home,Šthese are actions which, unsurrounded by any halo, would strike the minds of ordinary people with horror. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, who certainly knew what the sol-dier's business is, said, "War is hell." Putting this state-ment of this eminent military authority with that of Archbishop Ireland concerning the chaplain's office, we are brought to the conclusion that the legitimate business of the army chaplain is to cast a halo about hell! But casting a halo about hell does not at all change the character of that place. And that which needs to be invested with a "halo of moral duty" in order that people may be led to espouse and support it, would far better be left to appear in its true light, and be accepted or rejected upon its merits. Proceeding with his line of thought, the archbishop went on to say that,Š "The appeal of the chaplain to the living God, as ap-proving war and consecrating battle-fields, is in the fullest harmony with the teachings of religion. God is, indeed, the God of love and peace while love means no viola-tion of justice and peace implies no surrender of supreme rights." As soon, therefore, as a person feels that he is treated unjustly, or that his rights have been invaded, he may properly go to war with his enemies, relying upon the protection and aid of Heaven! This view will scarcely harmonize with the divinely given exhortation, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you." The archbishop was not, in this, stating something peculiar to his own views, or to those of his church ; otherwise it would not be so worthy of notice. The con-ception of God as "approving war," whenever people are suffering injustice, is a very general one, and is the idea by which the horrors of war are theoretically justified. But it has no foundation in truth. The archbishop continued:Š "The servants of God must ever seek peace so long as it is possible to obtain peace. They must never proclaim war so long as war is not absolutely necessary. But times come when war is absolutely necessary, when naught but war can avert great wrongs and save the life and the honor of the nation. Then the God of peace be-comes the God of armies; he who unsheathes the sword in response to country's call finds favor before God, and the soldier who is a coward on the battle-field is a culprit before heaven's tribunal." Yes; "the servants of God must ever seek peace so,  long as it is possible to obtain peace," and "must never proclaim war so long as war is not absolutely necessary." But when is the point reached where peace becomes im-possible and war "abolutely necessary"? Oh, it is when somebody is not treating us right and will not stop mis-using us as soon as we think they ought to; or it is when we have been insulted by somebody and the offender will not apologize to save our "honor" from being stained. It is, in short, whenever we think that war is necessary. And what we think on such occasions is inspired by the aroused passions and pride of fallen human nature. But God has not left the matter of living peaceably or other-wise to be determined in this way. People generally, and nations, usually find it quite "possible to obtain peace" when they do not feel strong enough to whip their opponents in the event of hostili-ties. And when peopleŠand nationsŠare naturally bel-ligerent, or have something to gain by fighting, and feel confident as to the result, it is very easy for them to reach the point where war is "absolutely necessary." In the late war between Germany and France, the contestants on each side "unsheathed the sword in re-sponse to country's call," and in so doing, both sides of the controversy found "favor before God," no doubt! One more quotation from the archbishop's speech will be in place. It is this:Š "The chaplainŠlet him remain to AmericaŠto Amer-. ica's army and navy. It is sometimes said that the chaplain is an anomaly in a country which has decreed the separation of state and church. America has decreed the separation of state from church; America has not decreed and America never will decree the separation of state from morals and religion. To soldiers upon land and sea, as well as to other citizens, morals and religion are necessary. The dependence of soldiers upon the gov-ernment of the country is complete. The government of the country must provide for soldiers teachers of morals and religion. In providing for them such teachers the country performs a duty which she owes to the soldiers and she serves her own high interests. For the best aŁnd bravest soldiers are men that are not estranged from morals and religion." Yes, it is true that "the dependence of soldiers upon the government is complete," under such a system as that for which the archbishop was speaking. But "pity 'tie 'tie true." There never ought to be such dependewe in the case of any individual. The archbishop frankly admits that, to the soldier, the government stands in the place of God. "The government of the country must provide for soldiers teachers of morals and religion." But the government has no higher wisdom or power than that which is human, and human wisdom is altogether inadequate to provide for the needs of the soul. In providing teachers of morals and religion, the gov-ernment will select such persons as it fancies, and these
