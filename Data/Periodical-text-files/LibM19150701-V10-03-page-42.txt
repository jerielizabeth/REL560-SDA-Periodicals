HOLMES THE question of slavery was stirring the people of the whole country about the year 1835. Publications were being circulated, especially in the South, tend-ing to arouse in the hearts of the slaves a desire for freedom. This propaganda was very distasteful to many individuals and even to States. We find in President Andrew Jackson's annual message to Congr,e4sof the year 1835 a reflection of the feelings and sentiments of those who oppc):gecl,  'the,circnlation of such liter-ature. HtŁ-sAfd: - I must also invite. your attention to the pain-ful excitement produced in the South, by at-tempts to circulate through the mails inflam-matory appeals addressed to the passions of the slaves, in prints, and in various sorts of publications, calculated to stimulate them to insurrection, and to produce all the horrors of a servile war. There is doubtless no respectable portion of our countrymen who can be so far misled as to feel any other sentiment than that of in-dignant regret at conduct so destructive of the harmony and peace of the country, and so repugnant to the principles of our national compact and to the dictates of humanity and religion. Our happiness and prosperity es-sentially depend upon peace within our bor-ders: and peace depends upon the mainte-nance, in good faith, of those compromises of the Constitution upon which the Union is founded.. . . I would, therefore, call the special attention of Congress to the subject, and respectfully suggest the propriety of passing such a law as will prohibit, under severe penalties, the cir-culation in the Southern States, through the mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection. The Senate took up the matter, and at the request of John Calhoun, " so much 136 of the President's speech as related to the transmission through the public mails of certain publications of a dangerous tendency" was referred to 'a select corn-mittee. It was favorably reported to the Senate Feb. 4, 1836. The Congressional Globe, for the years 1835 and 1836, gives numerous abstracts of the speeches that were made on this bill. The sentiments then expressed by some of our distinguished statesmen re-gardivf the proposed censorship of the pre'Ss, are pent at the present time. Though it was felt by the President and others that conditions demanded the passing of a law Abridging the liberty of the press in order to" preserve peace and harmony, it was defeated. Henry Clay declared that " it was too often in the condemnation of a partic-ular evil that they were urged on to measures of a dangerous tendency.. . . He hoped never to see the time when the general government should undertake to correct the evil by such measures as the one before them. . . . The bill is cal-culated to destroy all the randmarks of the Constitution, establish a precedent for dangerous legislation, and to lead to incalculable mischief." (June 8, 1836.) The Constitution provides that Con-gress shall have the power to " establish post offices and post roads." Some ar-gued from this that it was also within the power of Congress to keep out of the mails anything that was deemed objec-tionable. In reply to this argument, Mr. Morris of Ohio said: Š
