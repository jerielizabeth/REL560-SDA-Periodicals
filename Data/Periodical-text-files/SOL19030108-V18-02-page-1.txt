PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. VII/ NEW YORK, JANUARY 8, 1903 NO. 2 No one thought of vindicating religion FOR THE CONSCIENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL, till a voice in Judea, breaking day for the greatest epoch in the life of humanity, by establishing a pure, spiritual, and universal religion for all mankind, enjoined to render to Ceasar ONLY THAT WHICH IS CEASAR'S. The rule was upheld during the infancy of the gospel for all men. No sooner 'teas this religion adopted by the chief of the Roman Empire, than it was shorn of its character of universality, and en-thralled by an unholy connection with the unholy state. And so it continued till the new nationŠthe least defiled rk,ith the barren scoffings of the eighteenth century, the most general believer in Christianity of any people of that age, the chief heir of the Reformation in its purest formsŠwhen it came to establish a go7lernment for the United States, REFUSED TO TREAT FAITH AS A MATTER TO BE REGULATED BY A CORPORATE BODY, OR HAVING A HEADSHIP IN A MONARCH OR A STATE.
