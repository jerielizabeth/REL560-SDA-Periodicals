AMERICAN SENTINEL. 141 "Mama, why does the church want power from the state?" "Because she feels her weakness without it. But no church ever appeals to the state for power, which realizes that Christ is her champion; for he has allpower in heaven and in earth." "Well, then, the church must begin to feel her weak-ness, mama; for it was only last Sunday that our minis-ter told the people to vote as the church wanted them to. He said the churches could control the ballot if they would, and that unless we had a strict Sunday law, the Sabbath would be lost to our country. But as Satur-day is the Sabbath, the Sunday law wouldn't do much good." "Well, Charlie, whose day is the Sabbath?" "God's," said Charlie, reverently. "To whom then shall we render it?" "To God." "Yes. Jesus said, 'Render therefore to Cwsar (or the state) the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.' "Shall we do it, my boy?" "Yes, mama. The pope in me and the pope out of me say, `No;' but I must answer as Peter did in our lesson a few weeks ago, 'We ought to obey God rather than men.'" F. B. TO OUR PATRONS: 1.
