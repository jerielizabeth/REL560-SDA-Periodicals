328 AMERICAN SENTINEL. WE have received a circular sent out in the name of the Red Cross Society and Central Cuban Relief Commit-tee, inviting our cooperation in raising a "war relief fund," to care for "sick and wounded soldiers and for starving Cubans." Among other statements, it says that '`millions of dollars in contributions are needed to take care of thehundreds of thousands of reconcentrados in Cuba, return' them to their homes, and start them again in life." * * * WE are entirely in sympathy with the purpose for which this relief fund is supposed to be raised. But it must naturally occur to the person who has kept the run of events in this matter, to ask how these hundreds of thousands of starving Cubans are to be reached by their would-be rescuers. The United States troops cannot reach them at present, and whether they will be able to do so in the near future, is a question to which only time can give a reliable answer. And the Red Cross Society with its relief purposes to go behind the United States troops. * BEFORE the war broke out the Red Cross Society was doing a good work in Cuba in relieving the starving women and children who were victims of the cruel order of concentration. To abandon this work and withdraw behind the guns of the American army and navy, upon the rupture of governmental relations with Spain, is a proceeding which we cannot reconcile with the dictates of Christianity. Christianity does not retreat before the dangers which threaten life and limb from the hostility of any of the forces of this world. If it did, the gospel would never have been carried to savage lands where there was no knowledge of or respect for the principles of civilization. But gospel missionaries have gone to such lands everywhere, and there, under circumstances which afforded no reliance upon any human arm, the power of Christianity has been most signally shown. * * IT is, apparent, of course, that very great difficulties and dangers would naturally confront relief workers in Cuba, under the circumstances which exist to day: But what of that? "Man's extremity is God's opportunity." There lief of the starving Cubans is Christian work, just as much as the preaching of the gospel to the heathen. To "deal thy bread to the hungry" is as positive a Christian duty .a-s is Łany other of which we have mention in the  Word of God. Being thus a part of Christianity, God himself is responsible for the success of those who faith-fully engage in it; and this is all that any Christian can ask, It is his part to go forth in the name of his Master to the relief of his fellow men, wherever the victims of misfortune are to be found; and God's part to take care of the results. And this is one of the beauties of Chris-tianity, that it throws the responsibility of right doing entirely upon the Omnipotent. The Christian need have no care or anxiety in anything, save in keeping his own. heart right with God. It is worth all that it costs to be-a Christian, to be thus relieved of the worry and fearful-ness for the future which is the nightmare of so many lives.. * * * WHEN the Christian goes forth to duty, he goes be-hind the Omnipotent. God does not ask any person. to go before him. He goes first, always; and the Chris-tian's part is to follow and see the salvation of God. And it is a great deal better to go behind the Lord thank behind the army and navy of a great nation. It is a. great deal safer. The army and navy are powerful; but they are not omnipotent. But God is omnipotent; ands it is as easy for him to brush aside all the obstacles that lie in the way of feeding the starving in Cuba, as it is forŁ him to feed people in any other part of the world. It isŁ a greater miracle to cause the grain to grow out of the'  ground and the fruit to develop and ripen on the trees than it is to overcome all the Spanish forces in Cuba. The United States army can do the latter; but all the military power of the world could not bring forth from the earth a single stalk of wheat. When we see God doing the greater miracles before our eyes, shall we not have confidence that he will perform the less, if we ask it according to his will? THE poor Cuban women and children have been left to themselves, and they are fast dying of starvation. That is the result of the policy that has been adopted..  How many there will be left. to relieve when the war is over, no one can tell. Could these lives have been saved if Christians in this land had gone forth to them, not identifying themselves with the civil government, but with the kingdom of Christ, and in the name of Christ,  braving the difficulties and dangers of the task? That is a question for Christian people to answer to their own, he arts. * PRESS dispatches of recent date contained the follow-ing item of news from the Philippine Islands:Š "The archbishop of Manila issued a pastoral letter on May 5 calling on all Christians to defend the faith against the heretics, who designed to erect an insuperable barrier to their salvation, they intending to enslave the people and then forbid the sacraments of baptism, matrimony and burial, and the consola-ion of absolution. "The archbishop declares that if the Americans, are
