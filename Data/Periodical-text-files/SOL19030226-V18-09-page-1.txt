If the Almighty has set apart the first day of the week as a time which man is bound to keep holy and devote exclu-sively to His worship, would it not be more congenial to the precepts of Christians to appeal exclusively to the great Lawgiver of the universe to aid them in making men better Å in correcting their practises by purifying their hearts? GObernmnnt rtrill protect them in their efforts. When they shall have so instructed the public mind, and awakened the consciences of individuals as to make them beliebe it is a 2,iolation of God's law to carry the mail, open post-offices, or receive letters [or to labor, to buy and sell, to engage in amusements and pastimes, etc.] on Sunday, the evil of which they complain will cease of itself, without any ex- ertion of the strong arm of civil power. . Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persua-sion for enforcing religious observances. . . . The proper object of go'bernment is to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their religious as well as civil rights, and not to determine for any whether they shall esteem one day above another, or esteem all days alike holy.
