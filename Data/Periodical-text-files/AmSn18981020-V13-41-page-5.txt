AMERICAN SENTINEL. 649 The Interdict. BY FANNIE BOLTON. BLACK FLAGS hung from the windows, ominously, A gloom swept thickly through the sunbeams' mesh As though the wings of hell's battalions waved Across God's benediction. Black cowled priests Frowned from beneath their tosiars. Children clung With piteous fear upon their mothers' skirts, And men looked stern and stony with despair. Maidens as pale as ashes grasped their beads, Involuntarily muttering rosaries. In vain The crowds wailed wildly at the iron-barred doors That shut the great cathedral to their feet. The shrines were vacant, and no pitying priest Delayed to hear a soul's confession out. No absolution waited for men's prayer, No blessing for love's marriage, and no font Whose holy water made baptismal rite. Men looked in one another's eyes in fear, And women wailed and shrieked, and children:sobbed. Black death and plague, war, famine, feud and blood Was nothing to the soul's damnation sure, And heaven shut away and locked from men By him who held the keys in Peter's place, Vicegerent of the Son of God on earth. Horror took hold where superstition reigned. Men lost their manhood, and lay prone in dust Before a man. Women were faint with fear, Not for themselves so much as for their babes Denied adoption to the home above.  Then devils raged, exultant in their glee, Delighted at the torture of the soul; Their Inquisition chamber crowded full Of souls on racks, thumb-screwed and in the stocks, 'Neath iron pinchers, in the iron boot, And clasped and spiked within the cruel breast Of the unfeeling virgin. Men wizened And grew old, and shrieked the more When from a door a corpse was carried out, And laid as Judas in a Potter's Field, Lost, lostŠforever lost! Then such a wail rose from the stricken town That nought but demons could withstand, and he Who sat in Peter's chair received again The humble suppliants that kissed his toe, And put their necks beneath his jeweled foot, And heaven again was opened, bells were rung, Cathedrals crowded, and the holy font Sprinkled its drops upon the innocent. Marriage was blest, the dead were laid away In consecrated burial ground once more, Nor was the mass denied the soul in pain. Men smiled and women kissed their babes, and said The heaven is not brass to us to-day, For lo, the pope has rolled our guilt away. We in the light of better days look back, And smile and weep and wonder at old Prague Under the interdict. Yet stay Are we so far from such a scene to-day? What means the clamor, for the arm of state To give the church a power to wield such sway? What means the clamor for a Sunday law  To hold the weak in thrall, the bad in awe? And add to sin hypocrisy, that so Our nation may the curse of heaven know? What! Can human law make righteous? Can Compulsion change the heart of any man? Hath God left souls to utter derelict And given us over to man's interdict? Who shuts up heaven, but each man for himself? Salvation is not won by power or wealth. No arm of law that bids men wail, can bring The soul to Christ, and make him the soul's king. Away with laws religious on our books! Keep to the Pattern. See how mild He looks. Render to Caesar Caesar's, and to God That which is his, and bring on men no rod Man made, else will man be the fool of man, And hell exult to spoil high heaven's plan. Shall we go back a thousand years to-night In face of history's torch and heaven's light? Nay. By all means watch, work, sleep not, lest quick Hell steal a march on us in interdict. 0 sorrow! Helpless falls the pen away. 'Twill come. 'Tis coming at no distant day. The world shall mourn, and devils shall deride, Their wings the glorious light of heaven shall hide Save from the wise who will look up, and be Bound by all earth, but by all heaven set free. And from that interdict, no pope shall free; The King of kings himself shall bid it flee; And when hell falls beneath his high advance, And evil falters at his lightning glance, Then interdict shall ne'er fill men with pain And nought but love be known to souls again. What the Churches Teach Officially, Regarding the Observance of Sunday.-3. BY CHARLES E. BT/ELL. THE Disciples of Christ are rather more extreme than the Society of Friends. A representative writer of this denomination says:Š "Th e assumption that the Sabbath was changed from the seventh day of the week to the first day of the week, is without a particle of proof; indeed it is false in fact, for everywhere that the word Sabbath is used in the New Testament it manifestly refers to the seventh day of the week."ŠPardee Butler, "The Ten Commands," p. 1. Another of this denomination writes:Š "From the ratification of the New Covenant, the first day of the week has been observed by Christians as a day of worship; but not as a Sabbath."ŠB. A. Howard, "Sacred Time, The Lords Day," p. 17. A. M. Weston, A. M., who was president of Eureka College, Illinois, a school of this denomination, says:Š "You may call Sunday by its secular name `Sunday;' by its number, 'the first day of the week;' or by its reli-gious title, 'The Lord's Day,' but never, unless you would misrepresent it, call it the Sabbath."Š"The Evolution of a Shadow," p. 279.
