An Indictment of New York's Sunday LawŠI PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentine•  OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, AUGUST 20, 1903 NO. 34 Christian Sabbath observance is regulated from 'within, not from without. More important than what one does or does not do on the Sabbath is the motive and purpose from which one's actions spring. In the light of the Christian principle of Sabbath ob-servance decorous churchgoers and ministers who declaim against "Sabbath desecration" may be as great Sabbath desecrators as those who work or play. One of the greatest evils manifesting itself to-day in American society is the growing disposition of powerful religious interests to use the state in the interests of religion. This is the grand vice of ecclesiasticism, and it is second to none that can threaten the welfare of society. The right of the workingman, the clerk, the tradesman or any other man to a day of rest ends just 'when and where it touches the rights of others. When the workingman, the clerk, the tradesman or any other man attempts to compel others to rest, he is not exercising and protecting a right of his own, but is invading and trampling upon the rights of others.
