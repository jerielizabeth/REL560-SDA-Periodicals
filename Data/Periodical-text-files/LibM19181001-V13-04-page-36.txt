The American International Red Cross Work The Red Cross is the greatest mother in the world. It is the heart and soul of the army and navy. It is the great comforter and consoler, the physi-cian and nurse, the guardian angel and minister for the sick and wounded of both friend and foe. It unlocks the wellsprings of human sympathy, rectifies man's narrow, defective vision of earthly things, ex-tends his horizon of usefulness, awakens his better self, rounds out his character, and directs his life current into the channel of human needs. It cares for the refugee, the widow, and the orphan. It offers a cup of cold water to the thirsty, food to the hungry, clothing to the naked, shelter to the homeless, hope to the prisoner, and balm to the sick. Its work ;s divine, its mission is from heaven, and its field is the world. Those who have dedicated their service and lives to this ministry of love and mercy in behalf of suffering humanity, deserve our prayers, and our support in labor and money. Lei us endeavor to excel all past efforts and achievements in re-sponse to the call of need in the Red Cross Work. Loyalty to God and country and hu-manity means loyalty to the Red Cross. Every One, Irrespective of Nationality, Race, or Creed, Should Contribute to and Co-operate With the Red Cross
