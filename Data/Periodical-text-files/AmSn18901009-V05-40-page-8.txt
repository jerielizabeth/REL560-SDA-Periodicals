320 THE A_MEIRICA_N SENTINEL. VoL. 5, No. 40. NEW YORK, OCTOBER 9, 1890. Noma:ŠAny one receiving the. AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invari-ableŁ rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by,special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office. THE Dawn is a new paper published in Boston, " to advocate and explain Chris-tian socialism, and to favor all measures practically looking to a realization of socialism in the name of Christ." " Christian socialism " is simply another name for so-called National Reform, and the Dawn is simply another National Re-form organ, with variations. THE Woman's Christian Temperance Union, having secured an alliance with the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Prohi-bition Party, is now laying its snares to catch the Salvation Army; but our advice to the Salvation Army is, that if it wishes to continue to do the good work which it has been doing -so long, let it diligently refuse to allow itself to be joined in any way with the Woman's Christian Temper-ance Union. THE Convention Reporter, a new monthly paper, is the organ of the Sixth District of the American Sabbath Union, embrac-ing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Rev. James P. Mills, M. A,, District Secretary, is editor and publisher. The Evangel of Rest, issued monthly at Colfax, Iowa, under the management of Rev. Charles R. Hunt, State Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is another paper the mission of which is to mold public opinion in favor of Sunday laws. It seems to be the settled policy of the so-called Sabbath Union to multiply papers in advocacy of the objects of the society. THE Elkhorn Valley District Methodist Episcopal Conference in session at Oak-dale, Nebraska, August 19 and 20, adopted the following resolution :Š Resolved, That we, the members of the Elkhorn Valley District Conference, have learned with regret that within the last five years the Government of the United States has appropriated over two mill-ions of dollars for the support of sectarian and de-nominational schools, thereby connecting Church and State. This we deem unjust and unlawful, and we as Christian workers in the cause of Christ deem these demands of some of the churches for appro-priations, and the acceptance of the same, contrary to the teachings of Christ, our Lord, and the genius of our Government. This is a step in the right direction. Now if the whole Methodist body would take this matter up, and pass a similar  resolution, and then refund to the Gov-ernment the $18,825 that they received for the years, 1889, 1890, and 1891, we might hope to see a radical reform. IN answering answering a correspondent, who com-plained of railroad companies' creating " a class of deliberate Sabbath-breakers," by running their trains upon Sunday, among other things, the Christian at Work, 'says this :Š We deplore the Sabbath desecration that exists. At the same time let us remember that what is necessary and promotive of public good on Sunday, is not a desecration Š Christ's declarations as to which, the reader will readily recall. We confess our inability to "readily recall " anywhere in the Bible, a passage where either the Saviour or apostles re-ferred to the possible profanation of " the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." Will the Christian at Work kindly cite us to the chapter, and verse ? FOLLOWING is one of the " reasons " given in one of the California Sunday-law documents, for a " civil " Sunday law :Š " The sacredness of the Sunday is the laborer's only shield." The Sabbath as a political institu-tion is of inestimable value, independently of its claim to divine authority. There is no danger of destroying the Christian religion so long as the Christian, Sabbath is acknowledged and kept as a sacred day. So after all the great " reason " for Sunday laws is the preservation of the Christian religion. But there was a time in the history of Christianity when it was not only preserved, but when it actually flourished, not only 'without laws in its favor, but under bitter persecution. Why does it now need the support of civil law ? Has Christianity lost its power ? or have its professors lost all spirit of self-sacrifice that they now demand laws to remove from the Christian pathway every diffi-culty ? AND now we are to be afflicted by an-other form of paternalism in government, or at least by another paternal theory. Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhull Martin's latest idea of government embraces these car-dinal points : Only healthy people shall marry; legislators are to be versed in psychology and pathology; courts are to be presided over by scientists, who will study the mental condition of criminals and prescribe proper treatment; cab-inets are to be composed of philosophers, representing every branch of science, whose chief duty will be to look after the internal welfare of the people, see to the sanitary condition of all the factories, dwellings, etc., and find employment for all working people. " Mrs. Martin," re-marks the World, "hopes to live to see this ideal government established, and then die and be known to history as the father of it, as it were." When will the nonsense of attempting to legislate this earth into a paradise, end ? " FIRESIDE SKETCHES," is the name of one of the most attractive and valuable juvenile books that has ever come to our table.. It is a new subscription book of nearly 200 pages, eight by eleven inches, substantially and handsomely bound in blue cloth, ink-stamped, and in red cloth, embossed in jet and gold, the latter being of course the more attractive binding. But beautiful as is the outside of this book, the inside is even more attractive, because of the matter which the book contains, and the illustrations with which it abounds. The following partial list of subjects, all of which are treated in a most interesting and instructive manner, will give a good idea of the scope of the book:Š The Falls of the Yosemite, California Big Trees, General Grant in Siam, The Chinese in California, Columbia River, Salt Lake City, Alaska, .The Frozen North, Volcanoes and Earthquakes, -En-counter with an Iceberg, Zambesi Falls, Africa, Land of the Midnight Sun, South Sea Islands, Rip Van Winkle, etc. There is also a " Miscellaneous Depart-ment " of unusual interest to both old and young. The whole book is profusely il-lustrated, containing over 150 beautiful and instructive illustrations, over twenty-five of which are full page engravings. Besides the engravings, there are four excellent maps. Of the illustrations in " Fireside Sketches," the publishers say : " The illustrations have been procured with great care. Some we have been able to find in our own country, but many have had to be engraved especially for the work, or imported from foreign col-lections. No labor or expense has been spared to make this work as perfect as possible." The book itself bears witness to the correctness of this statement. Persons who desire to learn book can-vassing, cannot do better than to secure an agency for " Fireside Sketches," at once, and thus take advantage of the ap-proaching holiday season. It is a book that will sell at sight, in almost every home where there are children or youth, and even the older people will want it for their own reading. " Fireside Sketches " is published by the Central Manufacturing Company, Battle Creek, Michigan; Eastern agency, 43 Bond Street, New York, N. Y. THE editor-in-chief of this paper has been absent from the city for some weeks, and will be till about the first of next year. Personal correspondence should be addressed to him, in care of the Pacific Press, Oakland, California. THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.
