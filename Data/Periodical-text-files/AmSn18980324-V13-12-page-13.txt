189 and he was so cruel to the people that they rose up in a body and killed several thousand French' people and drove the cruel Charles from the island." MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE, Demoralizing Effects of War. "The Christian," London, Eng. THE demoralizing effects of war on all who take part in its fierce struggles is occasionally painfully evidenced in the letters sent home by the combatants. We had shocking illustrations of this in published letters of some of those engaged in the recent Matabele and Bechuana affairs. The present war in India furnishes some fresh examples. In one case it comes from the pen of the Chronicle correspondent. After describing the burning of some Aka Khel villages which ruined the homes of hun-dreds of non-combatants, some of whom begged our sol-diers to end their lives out of pity (one old woman tried to burn herself with her home), this representative of Army sentiment goes on to say: "Everybody, from the general downwards, was pleased with the success of the day's operations. A hot bath, the snowy whiteness of the cloth and the brightness of the silver which adorned the mess-table, and a night between the sheets, were af-terwards thoroughly appreciated." Such callous disre-gard to suffering inflicted, in contrast to the glorification of the comforts of the British camp, while those poor people were left to perish on bleak hillsides, is painful reading. Any employment that can thus dry up the springs of natural pity for the vanquished must be of the devil. Independence and Obstinacy. "Sunday-School Times." INDEPENDENCE is one thing, obstinacy is quite an-other thing. Independence is standing all by one's self, without being dependent on another. Obstinacy is stand-ing out against others, resisting all attempts to be swayed or influenced'by others. An independent man is ordina-rily not an obstinate man. He hears readily both sides, and willingly considers them. He may even adopt the view of another, as different from his former inclinations, but he does so because be of his own mind accepts that view without being controlled by anybody else. An ob-stinate man is ordinarily not an independent man. He sticks to his own opinion so closely that he cannot fairly consider any other, in order to see if it is better than his. An independent man is an open-minded man. An obsti-nate man has not an open mind. Independence is quite consistent with positiveness of nature and manner in ex-pressing present views, even though these views may be changed by the reasoning of the next hour. Stubborn, unreasoning, blind obstinacy is never independent, al-though the man who is bound by it often deludes himself by thinking that he has independence.
