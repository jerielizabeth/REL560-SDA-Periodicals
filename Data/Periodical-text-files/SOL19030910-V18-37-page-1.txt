WA. "In religious things the majority are generally on the wrong side." In the realm of morals right and truth are always in the majority, and he who would be in the majority must ally himself with them. The religion of a person has to do with the relation of his soul, not of society, to God, and it is therefore not a matter for social or majority control, but should be left to the individual and to God. A law which forbids labor on Sunday on the ground that it is immoral, and which at the same time gives per-mission to some to labor on that day, is either founded upon falsehood or is in rebellion against moral law. Most Sun-day laws do both these things. If it is right to exempt seventh-day observers from the legal requirement of Sunday observance, then it is wrong not to exempt all who do not conscientiously believe Sunday observance to be a moral and religious duty; and if all who do not conscientiously hold to the day as the Sabbath are exempted from the requirement to observe it (as they must be, or else suffer a flagrant interference with their rights of conscience), then there is no need for a Sunday law at all, for those who conscientiously hold to the day as the Sab-bath will observe it without the compulsion of the law.
