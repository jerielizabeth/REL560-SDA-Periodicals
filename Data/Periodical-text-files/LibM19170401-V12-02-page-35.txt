P E A C E!   ≈Å the a authority nations must individual governments; can mestic justice reasoning peace and but another or portion ber he force degree, can "The people of the United States cannot in honor withhold service to which they are about to be chal.enged, to add their and their power to the authority and force of other to guarantee peace and justice throughout the world." "The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded be an equality of rights."-President Wilson. IF these statements set forth true principles, and they certainly do, those principles must be as true of governments in their attitude toward citizens as in their relations with other therefore, it is axiomatic that there be no permanent domestic peace without do-justice. But if international peace must be based upon and the equality of nations, by parity of the foundation of permanent domestic must be equality of individuals and equal exact justice, not only as between individuals, as between individuals and the state. As one nation cannot force its religion upon people, neither can a state force religion religious observances or institutions upon any of its citizens, however small their num- may be. Will President Wilson remember the principles has so clearly enunciated if called upon to sign Sunday law or other act of Congress designed to upon ALL the people compliance, in some with the religious views or practices of a PART of the people ? We hope so, for only thus the American people hope to maintain abiding ' domestic tranquillity. C. P. B. -,alfigent-  4Mletkr  ' 'EtS"'
