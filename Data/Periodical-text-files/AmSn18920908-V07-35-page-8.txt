280 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. Vol. 7, No. 35. NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 8, 1892. THE SENTINEL of September 22 will be a number of special value and should be put into the hands of tens of thousands of new readers. For this purpose it will be fur-nished at one dollar per hundred, or eight dollars per thousand. Order Early: THE Baptists, after having made in the early history of this country an enviable record as defenders of religious liberty, are now, to some extent at least, proving recreant to the principles which a century ago they so ably advocated. This is most noticeable in their advocacy of Sunday legislation. -0- THE Examiner, a Baptist paper pub- lished in this city, in its issue of Septem- ber 1, thus defends Sunday laws:Š The State recognizes the right of man to a Sab-bath, or day of rest. The need of such a day is in-, delibly written in the physical and moral constitu-tion of man The law of periodic rest is imperious and is not to be broken without suffering, therefore " the Sabbath was made for man." The daily waste of reserved strength is not quite repaired by nightly rest, and there is need of such additional periodic rest as Sabbath observance supplies. Care-ful physiological study shows that the Sabbath is an institution essential to the physical and moral well-being of man, and that its preservation is'  more than ever demanded in these days of intense activity and grinding competition. It is on this theory that the State legislates, not to further any religious end. Š0Š CERTAINLY " the State recognizes the right of man to a Sabbath, or day of rest ; " and it also recognizes the right of man to a great many other things which,  it does not undertake to guarantee to him, and, above all, which it does not undertake to force upon him. The State recognizes the right of man to sleep, but it does Ł not,  for that reason provide that all men shall sleep at the same time. It simply pro-. vides that any man who wantonly and maliciously disturbs another at any time may be punished for breach of the peace, or for noisy and boisterous conduct. If some:  men choose to work at night and sleep in the day time, as thousands do, there is no,  law to prevent them from so doing. Why is not the same freedom of choice permitted in the matter of Sunday rest ? Š0Š THE oft-repeated claim reiterated by the Examiner, that a regular seventh day of rest is essential to the physical well-being of man, is by no means well-estab-1 iqhed. Peoples, who, like the Chinese and Japanese, have no regular, weekly lest day, enjoy, other things being equal, quite as good health and live quite as long as do people in the United States and England. " The Sabbath was made. 'for  man;" but inasmuch as it was made and given to him before the fall, before the sentence : "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," it-is evident that its pri-mary purpose was not physical rest but spiritual felicity. That this is so is evi-dent also from the fact that in the re-deemed state, the new earth, spoken of in 2 Peter 3: 13, the Sabbath is still to be observed as a day of joy and worship : " For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord." Isa. 66: 22, 23. The Sabbath is God's memorial, made for man, not that he might rest from phys-ical toil, but that by its constant recur-rence the creature might the better keep in mind the Creator. Sunday does not, however, serve this purpose, hence the necessity of finding some other reason for its observance. Š0Š THE Examiner's denial that Sunday laws are for the furtherance of religion, avails nothing in the light of evident and well-established facts. The claim is mod-ern and disingenuous. Our Sunday laws are derived from English law, and no-body pretends that English Sunday laws were for any other purpose than in the in-terests of religion. Blackstone treats of Sunday legislation under the heading, " Of Offenses against God and Religion." The civil Sunday for civil reasons was un-known in his day, and it is still unknown to the courts of several of the States of the American Union. The Supreme Court of 'Minnesota has decided (8 Minnesota Reports 13) that " the Sabbath laws of the State can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God's commandments." The Supreme Court of Texas held (Texas Reports 524) that " the' disregard of the Sabbath, the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes, constitutes the offense." Sim-ilar decisions could be cited in the Reports of many other States, notably Pennsyl-vania, Alabama, Georgia, Connecticut, and Tennessee. Indeed it is only in com-paratively recent years that anybody has denied that the purpose of Sunday laws is to protect the day in the interests of reli-gion and because of its religious charac-ter. -0- IN an unofficial utterance following his decision in the well-known King case, Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court for the Western District of.  Tennessee, said :Š It is a somewhat humiliating spectacle to see the Sunday advocates trying to justify the continuance of Sunday legislation . . . upon the argument that it is not in conflict with the, civic dogma of religious freedom. It surely is. Yet in the face.of this declaration Judge Hammond argues that, Š The bare fact that the mass desires Sunday as the public day of rest, is enough to justify its civic sanction; and the potentiality of the fact that it is in aid of the religion of that mass might be frankly confessed and not denied. Š0Š IN his decision of the King case the same Judge said :Š By a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom. . . . The religion of Jesus Christ is so interwoven with the -texture of our civilization, and every one of our institutions, that it is impossible for any man or set of men to live among us and find exemption from its influences and restraints. Sunday observ-ance is so essentially a part of that religion that it is impossible to rid our laws of it. If the Baptists propose to prove recreant to the principles for which their forefathers suffered persecution, some of them even to the death, let them do it candidly and openly, and not by taking refuge behind a falsehood. "The civil Sunday" is a figment of a bigoted and intolerant imag-ination. It is no more civil than was in-fant " baptism " when required by civil law in Massachusetts two centuries ago. Have Baptists forgotten the history of colonial times and their proud record as defenders of soul-liberty ? The Examiner certainly has. THOSE Tennessee bigots and persecutors who insist that Seventh-day Adventists might be compelled by law to work on the Sabbath, are respectfully referred to art. 11, sec. 15 of the Constitution of Tennes-see, as follows :Š No person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest. This provision covers all the ground. It fully protects every citizen of Tennessee in his right to choose his Sabbath, and that, whether he is at liberty or in prison. It protects the observer of the seventh day from jury duty and road work upon the Sabbath; and should protect him from the lash of the overseer's whip for refusal to labor upon that day even when im-prisoned for his faith, as Seventh-day Ad-ventists have been imprisoned in Ten-nessee. .110-10  WE publish on another page the call for the Sixteenth Annual Congress of the American Secular Union. It is to be hoped that the present Congress will con-fine its efforts to the objects for which the Union was originally organized, and not make it an occasion for waging war upon Christianity. Under the administration of a former president, the Secular Union was operated largely as an infidel club. Nothing could be more out of place in an organization inviting the co-operation of Christians. " Liberals " should be liberal indeed.
