LIBERTY 68 giously choose which day of the week is the Lord's day and to observe it according to the dictates of her conscience. That the accused religiously and conscien-tiously keeps the seventh day of the week for the Lord's day, or the Sabbath, which is com-monly called Saturday. That she does this in obedience to the commandment of God which says: " The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work." That the law in question which compels her to cease from labor on Sunday, the first day of the week, seeks to control or interfere with her rights of conscience, and is therefore unconstitutional. That the law in question which undertakes to compel her to cease from the " work of her ordi-nary calling " on Sunday, transcends legitimate legislative authority and interferes with her natural and inalienable right to worship Al-mighty God according to the dictates of her conscience, because the same Almighty God whom she worships and the law promulgated by Almighty God which she conscientiously be-lieves in and keeps, not only enjoin her to keep the seventh day of the week for the Lord's day, or the Sabbath, but also command her to work the other six days, including Sunday, the first day of the week. " Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work." Ex. 20: 9. That the said law indirectly compels her to keep Sunday, the first day of the week, for the Lord's day, by coercing her to cease from labor on that day. That cessation from labor is the way God in the ten commandments enjoins the keeping of the Lord's day, or the Sabbath. That she is thereby enforced to keep Sunday for the Lord's day by giving a Sabbath sanctity to that day, by refraining from labor when she neither believes that Sunday is the Lord's day, nor that it should be kept for the Lord's day, or the Sabbath. That her natural and inalien- able rights are therefore controlled or interfered with and she is prevented from worshiping Al- mighty God according to the dictates of her conscience, for she religiously believes that she cannot keep the seventh day of the week as the Lord's day, or the Sabbath, by doing no work on that day in obedience to the law of God, and then keep Sunday, the first day of the week, for the Lord's day, by doing no work on that day, in obedience to the law of the State of North Carolina, and be adjudged guiltless be-fore the bar of God. That she not only religiously and conscien-tiously believes in keeping the seventh day of the week for the Lord's day, but she also believes that she will be violating the law of God if she does anything, or refrains from doing anything, that would characterize Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Lord's day; and that therefore the said law that compels her to cease from labor on that day interferes with her right to worship Almighty God according to the dic-tates of her conscience, and it is void under the constitution of North Carolina. That the said law is religious legislation and void because it makes a union of church and state by compelling cessation from labor on Sunday, legislatively called the Lord's day for religious reasons, it being common knowledge of which the court may take judicial cognizance that cessation from labor is an act or a part of religious worship by religionists in the keeping of Sunday as holy time. That said law is class legislation and makes a religious preference and is void because it favors the observance of a day of the week for the Lord's day which is commonly called Sun-day, and, therefore admitted by the language of the statute to be kept as holy time by the majority, with freedom to work the other six days, while it denies to the minority the right to keep the day of its choice with equal priv-ileges to labor the other six days. That the said law deprives the accused of her property and liberty without due process of law by compelling her to cease from labor on Sunday when the labor she is alleged to have performed is quiet, undisturbing, and honorable and its performance is not criminal per se; therefore the statute contravenes the rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and her rights as a citizen of another State, and of the United States. That said law cannot be championed as a police regulation because it transcends the limits of the police power of the State by making an act for religious reasons criminal when done on Sunday which is honorable and lawful when done on any other day of the week, and which is not in its nature a nuisance nor per se a crime. That said law passed under the guise of an exercise of police power is a flagrant abuse of that power and an unlawful invasion of the rights of the accused both as citizen of another State and also as citizen of the United States.   111111 I1 L1111111111111  11111111 III1111111111111111[1o111h111111111111111111111111111111111111111i1111,1111,1111111,ii1111111111,1111111111111111111111111111'11111111,r1h1[11111'11i11111111[1111111111  1111111111111=111111MMM .1'1111',111;111111i          " The Jew [and the same would be true of any observer of the seventh day] who is forced to respect the first day of the week when his conscience requires of him the observance of the seventh also, may plausibly urge that the law discriminates against his religion, and by forcing him to keep a second Sabbath in each week, unjustly, though by indirection, punishes him for his belief."Å Cooley's " Constitutional Limitations," p. 476.
