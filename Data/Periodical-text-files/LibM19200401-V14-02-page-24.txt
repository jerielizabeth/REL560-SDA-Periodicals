Dak., Oct. 27, 28, 1919. Dr. Bruce R. Baxter, in the opening address, defined the Interchurch World Movement as " a thor-oughgoing plan and co-operation between evan-gelical churches of North America in their entire educational and missionary program, at home and abroad." The speaker stated that the Interchurch World Movement is not a drive, but a united movement on the part of the churches. He quoted John R. Mott as saying, " If a program like that of the Interchurch World Movement is carried out, in five years the church will have dominance and power on both sides of the water." And, added Dr. Baxter, " God have mercy on any man who does not realize that this movement is of God. God have mercy on any man who stands in the way of such a movement." Statistics were given showing the enormous increase of wealth. During the past fifty years the wealth of the United States has increased from $30,000,000,000 to $250,000,000,000, and yet it was stated that it takes the average Meth-odist eleven days to give one cent to foreign missions and thirteen days to give one cent to home missions. In closing his remarks, the speaker emphasized the fact that this movement means the sacrifice of denominational names, and a cutting away of narrowness. Dr. H. P. Carson (Presbyterian) gave a re-port of the Legislative Committee. The reason given for failing to secure Sunday legislation in South Dakota last year, was the fact that the committee had to meet the charge that they did not represent the churches, and that the  people had not been consulted. It was also stated that Governor Norbeck did not stand with them in the matter of Sunday legislation, and that as he was to be a candidate for United States Senator he should be made to feel that he had been remiss in his duty. The following appeared in the Huronite of October 29: " IMPROVEMENT OF SUNDAY LAW IS AIM OF CHURCHES " The closing sessions of the gathering were marked by the passage of a unanimous vote of a resolution on moral reform intended to bring about an improvement in our Sunday laws. " WHEREAS, The Legislative Committee for the Federation of Churches in South Dakota has been representing the churches of Jesus Christ before the last session of the last legis-lature; . . . and, " WHEREAS, The Christian Sabbath is not duly respected in South Dakota, and our own Sabbath laws are defective; therefore, " Resolved, That our Legislative Committee be highly commended for its faithful work, and that it be enlarged to include full representation of each denomination in the State, and that thus enlarged, it be charged with the high Chris-tian task of≈† "1. Bringing about an improvement of our Sabbath laws. " 2. Promoting the State-wide campaign against profanity and the use of cigarettes among boys. " 3. Preparing and pushing to a successful conclusion legislation for the creation of a board of review for motion picture films." Lest We Forget   SE By Sanford B. Horton   THE Constitution of the United States at its adoption contained no Bill of Rights, much to the regret of Jefferson and others who wanted the true principles of civil and reli-gious liberty incorporated into the fundamental law of the land. But the ink proclaiming its ratification had hardly become dry before a very pronounced agitation over this omission became rife, resulting in the proposal and sub-mission  by emigres,. in 1789 of the first ten 54  amendments, which are called the Bill of Rights of the Federal Constitution. The amendments were introduced by James Madison, the father of the Constitution, and were incorporated into that instrument within two years after their submission. The Virginia Baptists complained to George Washington, the presiding officer of the Constitutional Conven-tion, that while Article VI forbade religious tests as a qualification for office, there was no
