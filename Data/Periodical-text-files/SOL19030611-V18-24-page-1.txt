PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, JUNE 11, 1903 NO. 24 1 A man does not have to be his own employer in order to obey the dictates of his own conscience. The right to work is as sacred as the right to rest, and it loses none of its sacredness on Sunday. The "Day  of Rest" and not the right to rest is the thing that Sunday laws were made to safeguard. If his Sunday-law friends are correct, the workingman sells not only his labor, but his rights as a man and a citizen as 'well, for the wages he receives. The man who for the sake of his position surrenders his liberty and violates his conscience is indeed a slave, but his is a slavery from which no legislation can emancipate him. He needs not outward but inward freedom. To coddle him 'with special legislation is the worst service that can be rendered him. As long as the churches insist that Sabbath observance must be enforced by the law their pronouncements on the subject must be regarded and treated as attempts to prescribe law on the subject for the whole people instead of merely as regulations for the conduct of church members. What they condemn as "Sabbath-breaking" it must be under-stood they would have the law prohibit as criminal. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., 11 West 20th St.. New York City OAKLAND.
