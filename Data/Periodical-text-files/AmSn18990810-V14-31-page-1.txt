NEW YORK, AUGUST 10, 1899. VOLUME 14. NUMBER 31. "IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT," Jews Christ. A HOPELESS IDEA OF "REFORM."

He calls upon them to level down the mountain up which the narrow way leads to life, and make this way broad and smooth so that it can be easily traveled, and at the same time fill up the "broad way" leading to destruc-tion, so that it will be made a difficult path.
