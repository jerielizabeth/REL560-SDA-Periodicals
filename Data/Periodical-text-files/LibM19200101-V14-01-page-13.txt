LIBERTY 11 Religious laws make hypocrites. The conscientious man objects, and gets into trouble. It is certainly time for the ideas which controlled the religious per-secutors of the sixteenth century to be banished, never to appear again.' That  we have not attained the ideal is proof of the limitations of our fallen nature. There is in government absolutely no power to lift mankind to a higher spir-itual plane. The sooner this is recog-nized, the better. Sunday Law Versus Constitutional Law        By S. B. Horton           AN analytical study of law must reveal sooner or later the fact that Sunday laws are unconsti-tutional Š that is, from the viewpoint of the American or republican form of government. In the study of law one meets with such expressions as moral law, common law, statutory law, and constitutional law. The moral law is admitted to be " the will of God as the rule for the disposition and conduct of all respon-sible beings toward him and toward each other." We understand the will of God to be summarily expressed in the ten commandments, originally written on tables of stone by the Lord, one table containing rules concerning our relation to him (first, second, third, and fourth commands), the other table containing those commands which concern our re-lations to each other (fifth, sixth, sev-enth, eighth, ninth, and tenth). Common law is defined to be the un-written law (especially of England), " the law that receives its binding force from immemorial usage and universal reception ; as ascertained and expressed in the judgments of the courts." The term is used in contradistinction to statute law, which supersedes the com-mon law. Statutory law is " the written will of the legislature expressed with all the requisite forms of legislation "Š" used in contradistinction to the unwritten or common law." Constitutional law is " law that re-lates to the constitution, as a permanent  system of political and juridical govern-ment, as distinguished from statutory and common law, which relate to mat-ters subordinate to such constitution." A constitution is the " fundamental, or-ganic law or principles of government of a nation." In point of primary importance, then, the moral law stands first. It is God's will to man in his relation to him, ex-pressed in the first four commandments over which civil government cannot of right have jurisdiction in the least par-ticular; and his relation to his fellow being, expressed in the last six command-ments, concerning which civil govern-ment has been given secondary and lim-ited administrative authority Š in keep-ing with the thought expressed by the apostle Paul, " The powers that be are ordained of God." Next in importance is constitutional law, the fundamental, organic, and estab-lished policy of government beyond which and in violation of which legisla-tures and congresses may not rightfully pass. In America we have a nation of States with their constitutions and all the legal paraphernalia of executive, legislative, and judicial authority, yet subordinate to the nation's Constitution and statutes, the unity of the States be-ing expressed in the phrase, "E Pluri-bus Unutn"Š" from many one." The purpose of the Constitution of the United States was stated by its framers at the time of its adoption, Sept. 17, 1787, in these words : (Continued on page 28)
