PRICE Wilt thou rally thy legions to battle. And march on the City of Light, Whence angels excelling in power Were hurled to the regions of night? Wilt thou compass the city eternal, Its towers and battlements raze, And train thy batteries brazen On the throne of the Ancient of Days? CAN NATIONS CONTEND WITH GOD? "Am his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation." 5  For a nation to compel a subject to disobey the laws of a foreign nation, when it knows it is powerless to protect him in so doing, is hut to murder its citizen in cold blood, and merit international contempt. Will the government attempt to protect its citizens against the wrath of an offended God ? Will it declare war on the King of kings ? Can it marshal its hosts and hurl its serried columns against the Eternal City ? "WE OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MEN."' " WHEN they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people ; he suffered no man to do them wrong : . . . saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm." 7  If God had intended that his children should submit to governments in 'matters of conscience, he would not have protected Daniel in the lions' den, the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace, nor have delivered Peter and John, Paul and Silas; from their prison cells, where they were placed for disobeying human enactments. GOD AND THE POWERS THAT BE. "RENDER therefore unto Caesar the things that are Dtesar's ; and unto God the things that are God's."8  God has ordained that governments should exist among men. To these governments he has commanded his people to render tribute, honor, and respect. He has commanded them to be obedient to every ordinance of man, not for fear of punishment, but for the Lord's sake. So long as a govern-ment enforces ordinances of men, such laws only as are necessary for the protection of men in the enjoyment of their equal, natural rights,Å  they will not come in conflict with the Christian. 5  Jer. 10 : 10. 6 Acts 5 : 29.

PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING COMPANY, BOND STREET, NEW YORK CITY. Something Neat New and Novel Kansas City, Mo. The Gospel Primers A BOOK FOR THE CHILDREN. Contains 100 pages of matter, which will interest the old as well as the young. There are thirty-three full-page illustra-tions, which, in themselves, teach many gospel truths. The book has been re-written, and such additions have been made as it was thought would be of profit to its readers. Con-siderable prominence and much thought have been given the WORD-METHOD DEPARTMENT. It is not only desirable that the child should learn to read well in as few lessons as possible, but it is of greater import-ance that the mind should be developed spiritually while thus engaged. In the twenty-two pages devoted to this method, the child may learn to revere its Maker, and to love all for whom the Saviour gave his life. Such lessons, so early learned, are not easily forgotten. With the words which have been taught in the word-method, a short story has been written on the Creation. A few new words are introduced in this account of God's work in the be-ginning, and a practical lesson is taught of the power, wisdom, and stability of God's word. The same style and purpose is carried out in writing on other subjects. The aim is to keep the mind upon the things of God while teaching the child to read, and thus lead hint to remem-ber his Creator in the days of his youth. The book has been enlarged by the addition of thirty-two pages of valuable matter. It is a most desirable book fur teaching, as well as a pleasant and attractive feature of the home. It is beautifully illustrated, printed on fine paper, and bound in heavy board, with handsome design in colors.
