BY THE Rev. Thomas W. Haskins, M. A., Rector Christ Church, Los Angeles, Cal. JUNE 28, 1894. snNTNINIRIL., 207 MAYOR HOPKINS, of Chicago, has vetoed the Sunday-closing ordinance adopted by the city council some days ago. The mayor says :Š I cannot rianction a measure which under the guise of a police regulation to the preservation of the peace and good order of society on the Sabbath so radically interferes with the private affairs of the citizens. I cannot, take the view that in a large city the keep-ing open of a shoe store or a barber shop disturbs the good order of society, however desirable the closing thereof may be from the standpoint of the overworked employ6 or in the interest of a religious observance of Sunday. The proper and legitimate remedy for the overworked employes of the stores mentioned in the ordinance is either State legislation, or, far better, the peaceable, but determined, assertion of the power of organized labor, which has already accomplished such wonderful results in the matter of the reduction of the hours of toil and the amelioration of the condition of the working classes. Why the mayor thinks it would be any better for the State to interfere with the private affairs of the citizen than for the city to do it, does not appear. His latter suggestion that employ& can secure all they desire by simply asserting their rights in 0)0 matter is good. No man is com-pelled to work on Sunday, and the man who has any conscience on the subject will not do it. Too much of the opposition to popery is on the ground that Catholics are getting more than their share of the public funds. In a recent interview William Allen Butler is reported to have said: " Cold, hard figures show that in the city of New York alone the municipal aid given to Roman Catholic institutions amounted to $1,200,-000, while but $75,000 was given to the Protestant institutions. This enterprise, in getting a share of the public funds, is characteristic of the church referred to," said Mr. Butler, " and I do not complain of this enterprise, but if we are going to have a distribution of the public money we should have a fair one." There can be no fair distribution of public money among organizations not entitled to it. Every dollar of public money appropri-ated for religious purposes is misappropri-ated, and there could be nothing fair about it even if every church in the state were to receive a pro rata share. It is the principle, not the workings, of the system, that is wrong. " Cminca PROPERTY, Should It Be Exempt from Taxation ? Reasons Why It Should Not." 112 pages; price, 15 cents; Truth Seeker Company, 28 Lafayette Place, New York City. Thi.,; pamphlet, is an argument for equality of taxation, and a statement of facts, giv-ing from the census of 1890, the value, by denominations, of church property in the United States and in the several States and Territories, and in all cities having 25,000 or more inhabitants; so arranged as to show at a glance the relative stand-ing, as to wealth, of the leading denomi-nations and denominational groups. The pamphlet also contains much other matter of special interest in certain cities and sections. All comparisons and percen-tages are based on official figures. It is candid and temperate in tone, and is val-uable for the reason that while it does not present any better, nor as good an argu-ment for the taxation of church property as we have read elsewhere, it does give very much more full and accurate statisti-cal data than anything else that we have seen on the subject.
