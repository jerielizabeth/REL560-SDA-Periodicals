I do not admire the want of dis-cretion in the factory inspector, who might have passed a case of this description over; or the wisdom of the magistrate, who might have imposed the smallest fine possible.ŠDogberry, in London City Press, Feb, 16. MAYOR WARD OF NEWPORT [ARKANSAS] CLOSES EVERYTHING EXCEPT DRUG STORES. NEWPORT, March 4.ŠThis city is consider-ably worked up over the action of the mayor in causing every shop and store in town to be closed Sundays. Heretofore some grocery, notion, and confectionery stores have been running on Sundays the same as on any other day. The mayor concluded several weeks ago to stop this as there is a law against selling goods on Sunday. As a consequence several grocery men were arrested and their trial set for next Tuesday. Yesterday everything in town was closed. Cigars and tobacco could not be bought for love nor money. The mayor says he is going to enforce the law if it " takes the skin off." ŠLittle Rock (Ark.) Gazette, March 5', "THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL PRAISE THEE." [The following is a portion of the address of Elder 0. A. Olsen, President of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, delivered at the opening ses-sion of that body, held February 14.] THE agitation for religious legislation con-tinues, and with the spirit of true Protestant-ism fast dying out, this movement makes rapid progress. During the past two years the arrests of our brethren for Sunday labor have continued to increase in number. Dur-ing this time forty-one have been arrested, and thirteen have served a longer or shorter sentence in prison. These experiences are also coming to our people in other parts of the world. In Australia three -of our brethren have been arrested and condemned to the stocks. In Basel, Switzerland, Elder Holser suffered three weeks' imprisonment in conse-quence of work done in our publishing house there on Sunday. In Christiana, Norway, oar publishing house has been twice fined for Sunday labor. These fines have not been p lid, of course, and arrest is imminent. These things are intended by the enemy to discourage and intimidate souls, but the result is just the opposite. In this country, in Aus-tralia, and in Switzerland, persecution, instead of hindering our work, has given it a new im-petus.
