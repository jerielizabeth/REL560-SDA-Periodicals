Martinelli says: " Believing, as I naturally and sincerly do, that Catholic interests are well worth protecting and promoting for the welfare both of religion and of the civil society, and knowing the value of united effort for the protection of any interest, I do not fail to appreciate the importance and desirability of such a movement as you tell me has been inaugurated. If, however, it is absolutely necessary that any and every Catholic society, however humble, in order to have the approval and encouragement of the church,
