126 LIBERTY Shackle Not the Press OH, shackle free speech never, Nor make the press not free! Time brings to us no better gift, Nor can there better be. Impose on us no censor, One man must not decide; But verdict of a jury All men will glad abide. To think, to speak, to publish, No autocrat must bar: To find untrammeled liberty Our fathers came from far. No Power but Persuasion OUR Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion, for en-forcing religious observances. Let the professors of Christianity recommend their religion by deeds of benevolence, by Christian meekness, by lives of temper-ance and holiness. Let them combine their efforts to instruct the ignorant, to relieve the widow and the orphan, to promulgate to the world the gospel of their Saviour, recommending its precepts by their habitual example ; government will find its legitimate object in protect-ing them. It cannot oppose them, and they will not need its aid. Their moral influence will then do infinitely more to advance the true interests of religion than any measure which they may call on Congress to enact. The petitioners [for the discontinuance of Sunday mails] do not complain of any infringement upon their own rights. They enjoy all that LIBERTY A Magazine of Religious Freedom Editor, Chas. S.
