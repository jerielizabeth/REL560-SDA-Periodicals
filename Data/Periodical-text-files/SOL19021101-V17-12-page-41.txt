EDITORIAL 771  Ł suspicion regarding "the Church" and its representatives. If The Independent would display the same promptness and vigor in going af-ter and dealing with the serious and dan-gerous ecclesiastical outbreaks that no-body can doubt are at the bottom of this long-repeated rumor indicative of inti-mate and improper relations between Archbishop Ireland and the high author-ities of the Government, which in its la-test form it seems anxious to dismiss quickly with a mere denial, that it has dis-played in dealing with "a ridiculous little ecclesiastical outbreak among our Meth-odist brethren," it would be doing better service to the country and to mankind in general than it is. for their "impertinence," why is it that the really serious and dangerous imperti-nence of Archbishop Ireland in intruding himself as an ecclesiastic in government-al affairs, has been passed by without any reproof at all from The Independent? With relation to The Independent's fling at the intelligence of those who do not look at the Papacy through its glasses, we may say that they who de-clare that "the mission of Governor Taft to Rome was thoroughly successful," as The Independent has declared, are them-;elves afflicted either with intellectual de-ficiency or intellectual perversity. We have no doubt that many people are altogether too quick to believe anything that is evil of the Catholic Church and its representatives, that many are over-prejudiced against and too suspicious of it and them, and it is not at all improba-ble that these things might have had something to do with the action of the Wisconsin Mehodists.

This may seem like a hard say-ing, but fortunately it does not have to depend upon any argument or assertion of ours A short time ago there was consider-able comment and discussion relative to the proposition, which seemed to have strong endorsement, in Jewish ranks to forsake the observance of the Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment and to sub-stitute Sunday observance in its stead. Some saw in this an indication that the Jews were coming over to Christianity, and others saw other things. But there was one thing in it all that might have been seen, and that should be seen and emphasized, that nobody, not even the Jews, seemed to see very clearly, though it stood out as plainly as could be, and was unwittingly stated by many who had
