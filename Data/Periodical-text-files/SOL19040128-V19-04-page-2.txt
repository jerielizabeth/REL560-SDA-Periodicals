To whom all, communications of a business nature should be addressed. We believe in the religion taught and lived by Jesus Christ. We believe In temperance,and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society. We believe in supporting civil government and submitting to its authority. We believe that human rights are sacred, and that they indissolubly inhere in the moral nature of the individual. We deny the right of any human authority to Invade and violate these inalienable rights in any individual. Therefore we deny the right of any civil gov-ernment to legislate on matters of religion and conscience. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every individual to worship God ac-cording to the dictates of his own conscience, free from all dictation, interferenc,, or control on the part of civil government or any other external authority; or not to worship at all if he so chooses. We also believe it to be ourduty. and no less the duty of all others, to oppose religious legislation and all movements tending toward the same, to the end that all the people may ft vly enjoy the inestimable blessing of liberty, which is theirs by virtue of the unbounded wisdom and beneficence of the Author of their being.

A BEAUTIFUL AND VALUABLE BOOK A beautiful and valuable book that is most ap-propriate for gift purposes is the work " Journeys by Land and Sea: A Visit to Five Continents," by G. C. Tenney. " The spirit of our age is draw-ing nations and men into closer union, and a better knowledge of each other; travel and books of travel are the great agents of this transforming genius," says the author in the preface. " The knowledge of our fellow-beings, of their circum-stances, of the advantages they possess, of the dis-advantages under which they live, furnishes the best possible basis for a life of usefulness. The object of this book is to contribute somewhat to this knowledge." The book is a most interesting report of the author's observations and experiences in a journey 'round the world, starting from the United States and going westward. While the writer follows to some extent the highways of travel it has been his purpose, both in description and illustration, to pass rapidly over the more familiar scenes of Europe and America, and give most attention to those regions with which the majority of readers are not so well acquainted. These regions are: Hawaii, Pitcairn, New Zea-land, Australia, Ceylon, India, Egypt, and Pales-tine. A new edition of the work has just been issued after a thorough revision by the author-It is less bulky than the former edition, but con-tains the same amount of matter and is printed on much better paper. It contains 392 pages and so illustrations of superior character. It will be found a most interesting book, wholesome and instructive, and makes especially good reading for the young. Size 6%x9 in. and I in. thick. Beau-tifully bound in cloth. Price post-paid, $1.5o, with the usual discounts to the trade.
