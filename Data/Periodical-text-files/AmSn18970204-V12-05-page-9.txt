AMERICAN SENTINEL. 73 the beginning of this article that they have not the discernment to do so. There is an infallible detector of hypocrites which belongs to the true church, but it is not the Inqui-sition. Hypocrites attempted to unite themselves with the early Christian Church, but in Acts 3 :1-14 we learn that it was with fatal result. But this detector was the Holy Spirit, which departed from the church, as John Wesley tells us, as soon as the Church sought help from the State. No, the Christian Citizenship movement can-not have the Holy Spirit to protect it from hypocrites. An inquisition is all that is left. Will the Christian Citi- zenship managers organize an inquisition? A. F. B. 1- -4 The Origin of Government. BY II. E. GIDDINGS. ANY government that is formed in recognition of the principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, at once acknoweledges that the governed as individuals are the factors, and the com-posite product is the government. The individual is the unit, and the government is the combined sum when the units are added together. But the addition is made, the sum is obtained, by the consent of the units. All of the individuals as units, in a general way con-sent to the form of government in order that they may each enjoy the protection and other advantages arising from the union. They may not consent to all measures adopted by the majority of the people; but they have consented to government itself. They have consented to be governed themselves, by the political will of the mass, even in things that may not suit them. Men may differ as to what measures will best serve the purpose of securing to each the enjoyment of his nat-ural rights ;. but they do not differ as to whether there shall be government. All agree that governments are instituted among men for thd purpose of securing indi-vidual rights; and that all these rights are to be enjoyed and secured by the protective instrumentality of govern-ment. The foundation principle of the United States Gov-ernment is stated in the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men." In this brief enumeration of rights, we have an illustra- tion of the kind of rights that the Creator gave to each individual; and which each person has as a natural pos-sessiOn before he becomes a unit or factor in the forma:-tion of civil government. Because of the insecurity of these rights against the invasion of the evil-inclined, governments were instituted to secure these rights,Šor rather to secure those posses-sing them in the enjoyment of them. That is to say,  When people found that their. Creator had given them cer-tain rights to enjoy in this life, and that because of the prevalence of injustice, or a disposition on the part of many to rob others of their enjoyment of the rights which God had given them; and desiring to secure these rights for themselves and others; they established governments for that purpose. Now, the three designating terms employed in the Declaration of Independence are not intended to be limit-ing; for the language which points out the fact that men are naturally in possession of certain rights, says that "among these" natural rights are life, or the right to live; and "liberty as wide as the Creator bestowed on man; also the legitimate "pursuit of happiness." In this we have an example of the nature of all the rights which were given by the Creator-  to all, or each member of the race alike. Every natural right stands on the same basis and is alike unalienable. In other words, such rights cannot be separated from the individual so long as he has a right to life. Governments rightly or-ganized and administered never take any of these rights from a citizen by virtue of his citizenship; but secure him in the enjoyment of them all. Man did not in the beginning, and does notnow, give up any of his natural rights when he becomes a citizen of civil government. He consents to be governed, and to become a factor in the governing of others, in order that his rights may all be the better secured to him. The political maxim, and the divine truth, is that governments derive just power from the consent of the governed. It is power, then, and not rights, which is surrendered to a general fund in the formation of gov-ernment : this power to be employed in defense of the rights of each individual consenting. But the question may be raised, Did not each indi-vidual possess power and a natural right, to defend him- self, before he delegated it to the government as a com-bination ?ŠNo. Originally self-defense was not a natural right. Man was in possession of physical power; but it was given in the beginning for another, purpose entirely. The matter of self-defense is wholly an artificial necessity, arising with sin and the efforts of the evil ones to use the power God had given them, to impose on others. This evil was selfishness, which proposed to have its own way, even at the expense of others. Originally, man was endowed with power physically to accomplish certain ends; but self-defense was not a means to any one of those ends. He was given a mind capable, by its superiority, of governing all living things. The Creator gave him a virgin world with the Garden of Eden as a copy for the improvement of the whole in a like manner. The man was given intelligence and power to dress and keep the garden, and to subdue the rest of the earth in a like manner, and people it. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were his. But this did not in-clude, it does not contemplate, the pursuit of an enemy; for all were his friends. He was given power to govern himself.
