Sf (cstit dome and Religious Liberty in the Philippines PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR Th Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XIX WASHINGTON, D. C., FEBRUARY II, 1904 NO. O 1 ≈Å tIf " Loyalty to God means liberty for man." Rome believes in religious liberty only for Romanism. When the " rights " of Catholicism are protected the rights of man are inbaded. It is just like Rome to insist that "the larlt,  of religious liberty is unnecessary" for those who "do not profess any" religion. It is thP nature of the disciples of intolerance to insist that their rights are not protected unless the rights of others are inbaded. The attitude of Rome with regard to religious liberty in the Philippines is instructive as to her real attitude with re-gard to religious liberty everwhere else. If religious liberty in the Philippines is "adverse to the public peace" it is because Catholicism is adverse to the public peace when, whereber there is a possibility of hav-ing it done, other religions are not proscribed in its interests. "the preservation of the Christian Sabbath" requires that "our salutary Sunday law" shall be upheld and en-forced, then "our salutary Sunday a 1 b " e.; sists to up- hold "the Christian Sabbath." But that civil statute which exsists to uphold a RELIGIOUS institution is not a salutary law by any means. ft; PUBLICATION OFFICE : 222 NORTH CAPITOL STREET, WASHINGTON, D. C.
