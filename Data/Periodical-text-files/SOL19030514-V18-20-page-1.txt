THE PHILADELPHIA DECISION AGAIN PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, MAY 14, 1903 NO. 20 Suppose, instead of an overwhelming majority of Prot-estants holding certain views as to Sunday ('which was the fact 'when the act of 1794 was passed), an equally pre-ponderating majority of the Roman Catholic faith should exist in this Commonwealth, and, in accordance with that majority, the representatives in the legislature should in prevailing numbers be of the same religious persuasion. And suppose such a legislature should pass a law forbidding the use of meats as food on Friday, out of deference to the religious views and sensibilities of the majorityŠHOW COULD SUCH LEGISLATION BE HELD TO BE IN-VALID IF THE ACT OF 1794 IS SUSTAINED? ŠFrom argument of Es-Judge James G. Gordon at Philadelphia on March 23. When the thirteen colonies achieved their independence and the United States was formed, this governmentŠthe first great instance in historyŠplanted itself purely on the secular ground. The United States as a nation is not a re-ligious nation, it is not a Christian nation, it is not a Cath-olic nation, it is not a Protestant nation: it is a secular nation. With clear eye and deliberate purpose it refused to have anything to do with the establishment of anybody's religion. It took the ground that its business was to look after the affairs of this world; and it left everybody free to believe as they pleased and io exercise their religion in any way they chose. That is one fundamental principle of our government. ŠDr. Minot J. Savage at Church of the Messiah (Unitarian), New York, March 8. PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., II West 20th St..
