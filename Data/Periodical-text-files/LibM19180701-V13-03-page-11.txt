We would never have known how large a number of grafters there are in this country, if this war had not afforded them opportunity to manifest their true character. Some people ostensibly con-form to moral standards when not as-sailed by temptation, but this is no test of moral character. Many shout their platitudes of patriotism on the Fourth of July, but the rest of the year they trample upon right, liberty, truth, and justice. The boy who hesitates to face the fiery mouth of a cannon, they unhes-itatingly brand a coward and a slacker, while they, for " the love of money," would furnish him with defective weap-ons and adulterated foods. Some men who are loudly advertising their patriotism and their loyalty to their country, do not hesitate to put personal monetary interests above the safety of the Republic and humanitarian consider-ations. Dollars and cents are put above human lives. When men violate solemn contracts and promises made to the Gov-ernment, jeopardizing the safety of the nation to satisfy their greed for filthy lucre, we cannot call them patriots. It is time that we began to estimate things at their true value. Real patriot-ism is not measured by the accumulation of material things, when one's country calls for self-denial and sacrifice. Some people's patriotism and Christianity, if put into the balances of Infinite Justice at such a time as this, would be found to he lighter than vanity. The man who takes advantage of this war to " corner " commodities and inflate prices, who engages in the business of profiteering at the expense of his coun-try and humanity, and thereby jeopard-izes the safety of democracy and the lives of suffering peoples, will find that the glory of such riches is like the fading rose, the sweetness of such pleasure like the nectar of the poisoned cup, and the fame of such honor an empty shell. We can have only pity for the person whose vision is so circumscribed by his own narrow ideals that he cannot see be-yond himself, his own needs, his own pleasure. All that such a person will ever enjoy is the fleeting, transitory things that appeal to his own covetous nature. There are some things higher and sublimer than selfish desires and heart-less platitudes. There are some things sweeter and holier than earthly pleasure or ill-gotten treasure. The glory and majesty of man is unfolded in the ful-filment of his obligations to God, to his country, and to humanity. The happi-est hour in a human life is when one, looking for the last time upon the shin-ing sun in the heavens, is privileged, as he reviews his life work, to say conscien-tiously and honestly : " I have oppressed and defrauded no man ; I have scattered sunshine and blessing along the stream of life; I have lived to make other lives happy, and this world is better and hap-pier because I lived in it." If the Government had not checked the avarice and greed of some profiteers 73
