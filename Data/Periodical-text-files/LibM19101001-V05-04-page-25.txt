A PORTION OF THE PROCESSION OF 30,000 CATHOLIC SCHOOLCHILDREN, MARCHING TO THE CATHEDRAL TO RECEIVE THE PAPAL BLESSING THE CITY HALL OF MONTREAL, WHERE THE FLAG OF THE PAPACY HAD THE PLACE OF HONOR LIBERTY 23 See his encyclical of 1864. Pius X in-dorses all these, and on his own account condemns these liberties as among the " errors " of this time. What that means for the whole world when Rome shall accom-plish her purpose is not difficult to foresee. She is looking to the time when she will " come into her own." To " come into her own " means for the Pope to be recognized as the lit-eral ruler of all the world. Don Jaimie, the son of Don Carlos of Spain, is the present pre-tender to the throne of Spain. Dom Miguel is the pretender to the throne of Portugal Š and now Portugal has another. But the Pope is the pretender to every throne in the world. So the Pope's envoy in Montreal was given royal hon- ors by the Catholic piovince and Catholic Montreal, and was always on a throne in public. On the afternoon of September 8, the papal legate, addressing an immense gath-ering of priests in Latin, asked : " What could be more pleasing to us than evi- dence of readiness to obey the Pontiff ? " And the Pope himself, in his letter of appointment to the legate, said that through the influence of such congresses, the people of the world would be led " to honor with due loy-alty and submission the center of Christian unity, to wit, Christ's vicar on earth." Cardinal Vannutelli expressed the same idea on this wise : Š Visitors to the con-gress in Montreal, hail-ing from all parts of the world, . . . profess un-bounded love, obedience, devotion to the Pope, the restorer of all things in Christ, and im-plore the apostolic benediction on the first international Eucharistic Congress
