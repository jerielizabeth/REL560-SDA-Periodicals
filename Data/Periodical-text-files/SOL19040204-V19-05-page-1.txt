The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XIX WASHINGTON, D. C., FEBRUARY 4, 1904 NO. 5 " Sunday lalvs create mythical crimes for a specified period." " The time has fully come when the true nature of Sunday laws should be set forth and considered." " Christian patriots " who employ, or seek to employ, the civil lalv and the civil courts to maintain a religious observance are in that thing neither Christians nor patriots. " A lalv to oblige people to conform to any one or any system of religious tenets savors much of profanity, inas-much as it 'birtually prescribes the particular kind of wor-ship which the Deity is authorized to receive according to the statute in such case made and pro'bided." The Christian religion "suffers no man to judge another ' in respect of an holy day, or of the Sabbath days.' " " It denies the moral right of a mart to act contrary to his con-science, and forbids him to coerce others to act against their consciences and to conform to religious creeds they in their consciences disown. "ŠSee " What religion is that which claims for its professors a right to work, play, and traffic on the Sabbath day of others, and withholds from others their equal right to work, play, and buy and sell on theirs ? What religion is that whose professors oblige others to respect their " sabbath days" more than they hold themselves bound to respect the " sabbath days" of others? What religion is that 'lvhich alloUs one portion of the community to do by others as they will not allow others to do by them ?"
