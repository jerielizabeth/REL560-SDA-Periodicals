RELIGIOUS itiSTRUCTion PUBLic  ClicooLs  History Repeating Itself Christ Not to be Made a King by Force " When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone." John 6: 15. " It is not right to do right in the wrong way. It was right that Jesus should be king: it was wrong to seek to make him king by force. It is right that men should pray: it would be wrong to attempt to force men to pray. It is right that men should come to church: it would be wrong to force any one to come to the sanctuary. You can by force compel a man to pay hi. debts. Is that compelling him to be honest? The very attempt to force men to be religion. destroys the temper which alone makes religion possible. Jesus Christ himself would never con-sent to reign over the soul by mere force. If you would force men to Christ, you could not force Christ to men."Š Joseph Parker, D. D.
