All this is directly contrary to the plan of the Creator. -R4 No human law can add anything to the law of God. ENFORCED idleness is never promotive of good order nor of morality. -44 GOVERNMENTS were made to serve men, not men to serve governments. Ł .10  THE wrong side of the question always tries to make up by the use of force, what it lacks in argument. -414- .4.- HUMAN law cannot strengthen the moral and reli-gious safeguards which protect society. These can be strengthened only by that which purifies the heart. SOME persons would get along very much easier in life if the time and effort they spend in trying to "get around"" the truth and evade their duty were spent in searching out the truth and living it. EVERY individual has an unalienable right to rest on Sunday, in accordance with what may be his convictions of duty. But his right to rest on Sunday cannot be secured by taking away another person's right to work on that day. Rights do not thus conflict with each other. GOD made men different from one another; he gave to each an individuality.

Suppose that men had it all, as had Solomon, and could teach it as Solomon taught it. With the heart not surrendered to God, with the soul not saved, what good would science do them? It could not restrain them from any kind of wickedness or corruption that is in the human heart. The sciences are not what the world needs to-day, first of all. More than all else, the heart needs to be purified, the soul needs to be saved, the whole character rebuilt, the mind transformed into the very image and glory of God, so that the life shall reflect his righteous-ness, to make manifest the knowledge of God alone to all the world. Though men have all that all the sciences can give, it will profit nothing without salvation; for it will be but a little while till they willhave none of it at all. There is another thing: God wants all men to think right on every subject. There are men to-day thinking
