Some of the States maintained a state church and kept religious laws upon their statute books long after the Constitution forbade to the Federal Government such establishment or legal interference with the rights of the individual con- science and a man's duty toward God. Thomas Jefferson drafted the stat-ute for religious freedom in Vir-ginia the same year that he wrote the Declaration of In-dependence for all the States. But hisbill for religious freedom, which he submitted to the legislature of Vir-ginia, did not be-come a law until 1785. The pream-ble to this famous ' Act for Establish-ing Religious Free-dom" reads as follows : " Well aware that Almighty God hath created the miifd free; that all attempts to in-fluence it by temporal punishments or bur-¥ dens, or by civil inca-pacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a depar-ture from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish con-tributions of money for the propagations of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and  tyrannical; that even the forcing him to sup-port this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty ¥ of giving his contributions to the par-ticular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persua-sive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporal rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their per-sonal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremit-ting labors for the in-struction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that, therefore, the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the pub-lic confidence by lay-ing upon him an inca-pacity of being called to the offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fel-low citizens he has a natural right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honors a n d emolu-ments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of prin-ciples, on the supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt actions against peace and good order; and, finally, that truth is great, and will prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to
