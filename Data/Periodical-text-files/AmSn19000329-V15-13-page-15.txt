HENRY'S LAST BOOK Treats good manners as related to soci-ety rules in gospel work. A most help-ful book for old or young, laity or clergy, all who are "earnestly looking for the best means of serving God and human- ity." First Impressions are Most Lasting! Habits Determine First Impressional Of this excellent unsectarian work Mrs. Henry says in the Preface:Š "Let no one suppose that I have been laying down a Xot of rules.' The most I have attempted to do is to point out some of those regulations which the ex-perience of thoughtful men and women of the world has found necessary to good social order, as well as some of those things that a long experience in work for the unfortunate has discovered as requisite to the prevention of scandals, and consequent ostracism." 150 pages.
