THE MINISTRY OF LOVE Only Loving Service Acceptable By W. J. Stone GOD does not force any one to obey him. God is love, and lov-ing service alone is acceptable to him. So he says, " If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." " If ye love me, keep my commandments." " Love is the fulfilling of the law." John 12 : 47 ; 14 : 15 ; Rom. 13 : 10. Men are not won to the service of God by compulsion, but by the " great love wherewith He loved us," in giving his Son to die for us. " The love of Christ constraineth us." Eph. 2 : 4 ; John 3 : 16 ; 2 Cor. 5 : 14. In the most tender words the Lord appeals to us to accept salva-tion. He says, " Come now, and let us reason together : . . . Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." Isa. 1 : 18. The disciples of Christ employed the same means in winning souls. They sought no help from the civil power; but  by the aid of the Holy Spirit they ap-pealed to the consciences of men. " Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye recon-ciled to God." 2 Cor. 5: 20. The power of God to convert sinners is not in the civil law, but in the gospel. " I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1 : 16. A backslidden church seeks the aid of the civil power in carrying forward its work, and would co)npel men to be re-ligious. " Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city [city of churches], be-cause she made [or compelled by law] all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication." Rev. 14: 8. Revelation 14 : 9-12 gives a clear vision of how God regards the compulsion of men in matters of conscience: (Concluded on page 92) 79
