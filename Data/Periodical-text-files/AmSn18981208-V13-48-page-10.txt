766 AMERICAN SENTINEL. The War of Principle.ŠNo. 10. "ALECK, do you really believe that men to-day must have the experience of the apostles in order to be true to truth? Do you not think that there is in noble men the innate self-control and power to stand for principle with-out a conscious endowment of heavenly power? Hasn't education and civilization, by bringing before the world noble ideals, wrought.a change in men, so that they not only can be true to truth, but would scorn to be other-wise?" "Well, Cecil, you have asked me three questions all at once. First, do I think it necessary to have the apos-tolic experience to be true to truth? Yes, I do. For the second question, I believe that all the nobleness men possess is given by the Holy Spirit; and third, that the very idea of education and civilization are results of its working. When men scorn to be untrue, they have been conscious or unconscious recipients of divine power; and that in this day, as well as long ago, the hope of nobility is found alone in a heavenly endowment. "Now, Cecil, let us follow the disciples in their experi-ence. We have seen their cowardice, their fear of man, their weakness, duplicity, selfish meanness, their deser-tion of Christ in the hour of his greatest need." "Aleck, a new thought has come to me. Do youthink that all men would show the same weakness of character, were they tried as the disciples were?" "No doubt, Cecil. Put to the test, we should find out the truth about ourselves, and self-trust, self love, self-sufficiency, would be mightily shaken." "I can see that their experience must have wrought deep humility in them, and a feeling of need for a better support than they had in themselves." "Cecil, that is the only object of the trials that come to men. The loving Father knows we are deceived in ourselves, and has to permit these trials to come in order that we may be convinced of the truth. It is not to give us a painful sense of our weakness and to sink us in de-spair; but rather, that knowing our insufficiency, we may make connection with him, and be divinely sus-tained. Love invites us to his heart. It is beautiful to think of." "Aleck, I never thought I should want to be divinely sustained. I supposed.I was strong in myself; but now I begin to feel a desire to find out if I am weak, and if so, to be in conscious touch with God." "Dear friend, I knew you would come to this desire. Are you willing to be tested? Can you sing, "Nearer my God, to thee, nearer to thee, E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me?" "I do not know, Aleck; I tremble at the cost of- the experience. But I am willing to pray to be made will-ing." " 'Ask, and ye shall receive,' "said Aleck, "that's what the disciples did." "Yes; but they came with a full knowledge of their weakness, while I am only beginning to suspect mine." "Never mind, Cecil. As you are able to bear the rev-elation, God will let you see the truth. ."Now let us turn to Acts and see how the disciples obtained the promise of power. Perhaps it is essential for you to have a knowledge of the power that may be yours before your test comes, that you may know a way from despair. When the disciples went back from Olivet, how did they feel?" "They went back rejoicing," said Cecil. "How puz-zling their appearance must have been to those who thought their cause lost, their King crucified, and their kingdom a myth." "Indeed it must have been so, especially as they had not yet received the power to be witnesses of what they knew was truth. "What did they do, Cecil? Read Acts 1:14." "'And they continued in prayer and supplication.' Why did they need to pray, Aleck?" "To realize their own need that they might appreci-ate the blessing, and know that its source was God. For ten days they prayed together with one accord. No jeal-ousy, no envy, no evil surmising kept them apart. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, what hap-pened? Read Acts 2:2." " 'And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting . . . and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost." What a strange experience' 'Yes; it was wonderful. But its results were more wonderful. The Spirit is a strengthener of the inner man,Šof the character. It renews us into the image of.  Him who created us. Christ said that the Spirit would lead into all truth; that it would glorify him, take his things and shew them unto us, bring gifts by which our ministry would be increased and made effectual. "Now let us notice the change in these once wavering disciples. They were no longer afraid to witness for Christ. They began to speak with tongues, and men of every nation came to hear their testimony." "The Jews didn't stop them after all, not even by crucifying Christ," said Cecil. "Stop them? No. How much better for them if they had taken the advice of Gamaliel, who said, Let them alone. If this is of God, it cannot be overthrown.' You have here another illustration of the inefficiency of hu-man power, the fatality of trusting in it. Of what avail was the execution of the human law? A power greater
