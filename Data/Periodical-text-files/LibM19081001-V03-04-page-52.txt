THE _ -,r4MODERN URCti TURNING TO CAESAR "Your Sunday and all other forms of act-of-Par-liament religion seem to me to be all wrong. Give us a fair field and no favor, and our faith has no cause to fear. Christ wants no help from Ceasar. I should be afraid to borrow help from the government; it would look to me as if I rested on the arm of flesh, instead of depending on the living God."Å Spurgeon.
