A Convert to Prohibition 1\4 AYOR DAHLMAN, of Omaha, has seen a light on the prohibi- tion question. Once he was an extreme and outspoken opponent of pro-hibition. Now, having observed the ef-fect of prohibition in his home town, he confesses to a complete change of opinion. In an interview he was asked if the policy had hurt Omaha, and promptly replied, " No. Everything is all right here." Asked then about the effect on busi-ness, he replied : " It has helped business. People are able to buy more, and collections are much better. It is easy to understand that when we had sa-loons, a man would stop in a saloon and spend half of his week's pay before he went home. Now he takes the money home to his family. In the evening he will clean up, eat his supper, and come down town with his wife to buy groceries." Asked next about the number of men who had been thrown out of employment  by the closing of the saloons and the breweries, he replied: "No, there are no unemployed; there is plenty of work. You know I used to be wet, and used to make speeches on the wet side, tell how many people would be thrown out of employment, how many millions of dollars of business would be lost, and the lot of va-cant houses there would be; but it has not panned out that way. Arguments, outside of that of personal liberty, so generally used by antiprohibitionists, are shot to pieces so far as our city is concerned, as they have not ma-terialized." Asked then if he would make speeches again for the saloon, he replied: " I couldn't and be honest, and I wouldn't be dishonest. I used to think prohibition would be a bad thing, but it has not turned out that way." Mayor Dahlman, in confessing his con-version, said he could not " go against the facts."Š The Washington Evening Star, Nov. 21, 1917. © Committee on Public Information, from Underwood & Underwood, N.
