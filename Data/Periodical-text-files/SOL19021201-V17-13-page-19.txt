THE NEBRASKA DECISION 815 conform to these regulations, or incur the pen-alty of loss of rank in deportment and scholar-ship. Unless opinions of universal acceptance in this country since the foundation of our government are at fault, it is a policy of the highest importance that the public schools should be the principal instruments and sources of popular education, because they exert more than any other institution an influence promo-tive of homogeneity among a citizenship drawn from all quarters of the globe. But if the sys-tem of compulsory education is persevered in and religious worship or sectarian instruction in the public schools is at the same time per-mitted, parents will be compelled to expose their children to what they deem spiritual con-tamination, or else, while≈Å bearing their share of the burden for the support of public education, provide the means from their own pockets for the training of their offspring elsewhere. It might be reasonably apprehended that such a practice, besides being unjust and oppressive to the persons immediately concerned, would, by its tendency to the multiplication of paro-chial and sectarian schools, tend forcibly to the destruction of one of the most important, if not indispensable, foundation stones of our form of government. It will be an evil day when anything happens to lower the public schools in popular esteem or to discourage at-tendance upon them by children of any class. It may be unnecessary to remark that neither the writer nor the court is intended to be com-mitted to any view of any of the matters of theological or exegetical controversy touched upon in the foregoing discussion. All that is intended to be said is that such matters, being the subjects of sectarian differences, are ex-cluded by the express words of the constitution from being taught or in any degree counte-nanced in educational institutions maintained to any extent by the public funds. It is the function of the court to expound not religious creeds or writings, but the constitu-tion and laws of the State. We are of opinion that the return does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the alternative writ, and it is recommended that the judgment of the district court be reversed and that a peremp-tory writ as prayed issue from this court to the respondents and their successors in office. This decision was concurred in by the entire court, two of the justices, however, declaring that they concurred solely on the ground that the exercises complained  of in this particular case were sectarian instruction within the meaning of the constitution. In a specially concurring opinion Justice Holcomb declared that he did not hold to the view "that it is not within the discretionary power of the authorities of school districts to sanction, if deemed wise, under proper restrictions, the reading of the Bible or portions thereof or readings therefrom, in the pub-lic schools," and disagreed entirely with "the views apparently entertained and held to in the opinion to the effect that the exercises complained of constitute thereby the school house a place of wor-ship within the meaning and contrary to the section of the constitution wherein it is ordered, 'No person shall be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship against his consent.' " He de-clared that "the Bible itself is not a sec-tarian book, and it is, an erroneous con-ception to so regard it," and that no one could successfully contend "that the con-stitutional framers and the people who adopted that instrument intended to alto-gether exclude the Bible from the schools." He held that the provision of the constitution regarding sectarian in-struction in public schools was given the scope and effect intended by the framers of the constitution and the people who adopted it when "all forms of instruction calculated to establish and confirm in the minds of students those theological doc-trines and beliefs which are peculiar to some only of the different religious sects" were firmly excluded from the schools, and that "further than this we are not warranted in going." With regard to the other point, he declared that if it were sound, "then it would seem that it is in the power of any taxpayer to prevent re-ligious exercises in any of the penal, re-formatory, or eleemosynary institutions in the State and to close the doors of the State capitol to the chaplains of both branches of the legislature."
