 ONE DOLLAR A YEAR PUBLISHED WEEKLY            The Sentinel       OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY      VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, JULY 16, 1903 NO. 29          As Pope Leo XIII. is head of the most puissant 'world power in existence. The ecclesiastical empire of which he is the Imperator is usually thought of as a church. Speak-ing accurately, it is not simply a church. A church is a fraternal society, organized after a well-recognized fashion, and having for its sole purpose to commend the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world of men. The Roman organiza-tion has in addition quite another purpose. Religious action is co-ordinated with political action. Its essential claim is to be the inheritor of the absolutism which imperial Rome once exercised over the civilized world. As a weapon to subjugate the world it has adopted and has come to believe the theory that the Bishop of Rome has inherited from St. Peter a plenary power over all things and interests, a power whose completeness can be scientifically expressed by giving him the all-embracing title of "The Vicegerent of God upon Earth." OF THIS CLAIM IT HAS ABATED NO WHIT. The glory of Leo XIII., or his discredit, according to the way one looks at the matter, is that he has been able to do more than most of his predecessors to make that claim endurable. This he has been able to effect by means of a cautious, bland, conciliatory diplomacy, but without retracting or minimizing any single one of the most sweeping papal claims. It is remarkable and surprising that he has taken the longest step toward political and moral absolutism which has been made by any Pope for eilkt centuries. ŠDr. S. D.
