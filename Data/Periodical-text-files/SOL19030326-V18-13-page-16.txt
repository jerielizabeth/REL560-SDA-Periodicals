She Story of One Endowment An author of many years' experience as a student of and writer on Biblical subjects was burdened with a desire to endow several small educational institutions located in different parts of the United States. The MSS. of a book was prepared, the author donating all expense and royalties, and a fund was raised by popular subscription for the purchase of all materials entering into its make-up. The publishers agreed to donate every dollar that they would receive for work upon the book, from the time the first type was set until it was bound and packed ready for shipment, and all who sell any copies do so gratuitously. The result : the colleges receive, not a small commission, but the entire proceeds from the sale of this beautiful and well written work, entitled Christ's Object Lessorys or the Parables of Jesus The book contains 436 pages, is aptly and artistic-ally illustrated so as to bring vividly before the reader the lessons of the Saviour, and is printed on a superior grade of paper. The price is but $1.25. postpaid. You can aid this noble workŠthis great philan-thropic undertakingŠby purchasing a copy of " Christ's Object Lessons." Remember, you get value received for your money. Address, The Pacific Press Publishing Company 11 W. 20th St., New York City Ł Kansas City. MO. Oakland. Calif.
