The Supremacy of the Papacy By Alonzo 7'. Jones VII THE PAPACY-THE VERY SAME PAPACY THAT THE WORLD KNEW IN THE TENTH CENTURY-IS TO-DAY AIMING TO SECURE TO HERSELF A RECOGNIZED SUPREMACY IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SHE HAD THIS ONCE. THE ARTICLES THAT ARE APPEARING UNDER THE ABOVE HEADING ARE A STUDY OF HOW SHE USED IT. SINCE IT IS HER OWN BOAST THAT "ROME NEVER CHANGES," TO KNOW WHAT SHE DID WITH SUCH SUPREMACY WHEN SHE HAD IT IS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH IT WHEN SHE SECURES IT AGAIN. AT the death of Pope Innocent VII., November 13, 1406, the cardinals, fifteen in number, immediately entered into conclave, and took the usual solemn oath that whosoever of them might be elected would renounce his office when the rival pope at Avignon would do the same. The one of their number who had most constantly, and seemingly most earnestly, deplored the schismŠAngelo CorarioŠwas elected, at the age of eighty years, taking the papal name Gregory XII. (Nov. 19, 1406, to Oct. 18, 1417). After his election, as well as before, he proclaimed his profound interest in quenching the schism of the Church. He declared that "his only fear was lest he should not live to accomplish the holy work." At his coronation he renewed, with tears, this affirmation. And, in private, after his coronation, he declared that "for the union of the Church, if I had not a galley, I would embark in the smallest boat; if without a horse, I would set out on foot with my staff." But his very first act betrayed the hypocrisy of all these professions. He wrote a letter to Benedict XIII., addressed: "To Peter de Luna, whom some nations, during this miserable schism, call Benedict XIII." Benedict answered in a letter addressed: "To Angelo Corario, whom some, in this pernicious schism, name Gregory XII." Benedict exhorted Gregory : "Haste! De-lay not ! Consider our age, the shortness of life; embrace at once the way of salva- tion and peace, that we may appear with our united flock before the Great Shep-herd." Each of them pledged himself to make no new cardinalsŠexcept to keep their numbers equal. Gregory wrote to the king of France such beautiful letters on the evils of schism and his heart's deep longing to heal this schism, that the king was persuaded that he was fairly an angel.  of light. Progress was made to the point at which a meeting was actually arranged for the two popes, at Savona, in 1407. Pope Gregory set out from Rome in great state, and traveled to Viterbo, where he remained two months. Next he traveled to Sienna. The meeting of the rival popes was appointed for Sep-tember 29. Partisans of GregoryŠmonks and friarsŠbegan to preach against his going to the. meeting. Greg-ory himself drew up a statement con-taining twenty-two objections to Savona as the place of meeting. He demanded that the place of meeting be some town in the possession of a neutral powerŠCarrara, Lucca, Pisa, or Leghorn. Ben-edict XIII., on his part, advanced at about the same rate as Gregory ; and so,  came finally to Spezzia. Gregory ad-vanced to Lucca. They were now about forty-five miles apart. One was on the seashore, and' the other was inland. There they stood. As related by one who was present, and' an eye-witness to the whole procedure,.
