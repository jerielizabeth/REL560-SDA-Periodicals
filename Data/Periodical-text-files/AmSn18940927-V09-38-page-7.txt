C.AN 303 those cases in which a party or individuals see fit to drag religion into politics and to become the tool of cliques, as un-A merican as they are un-Catholic."-New York Sun, Sept. 20. Joins the Catholic Church. NEW YORK, Sept. 9.-The Roman Cath-olic Church has gained a convert from Episcopalianism in the person of the Rev. Walter Clayton Clapp. The Rev. Mr. Clapp was received into the Catholic Church Friday by the Rev. Father Elli-ott, at the Paulist Church of St. Paul the Apostle. Dr. Clapp, during the time of his con-nection with the Protestant Episcopal Church, was known as a very high church-man. He is thirty-two years old. He was graduated from Amherst College in 1883. He is the son of a New York busi-ness man who is a deacon in the Baptist Church of the Redeemer in Harlem.-Washington Post, Sept. 10, 1894. Rome Wants Statistics. 10f the return of Dr. Burtsell to this country from Rome, the Tribune, of the 3rd. inst., says:---] HE has been appointed agent for the United States of the Society for the Propa-gation of the Encyclical Rerwm Novarum, for the proclamation of that body with his name attached has preceded him. His appointment as the agent of this society is considered by his friends to be a great honor. The Society for the Propagation of the Encyclical Rerum Novarm, of which little or nothing is known in this country, has for its object the promulgation and fos-tering of the principles of the encyclical of the pope on the labor question two years ago. It is one of special interest to the pope, and its president is Cardinal L. M. Parocchi, Vicar-General of the pope. Following is a copy of the proclamation, 'which will be distributed in every diocese for information concerning the working-men's organizations in the United States: Important to workingmen's societies. Society for the Propagation of the Encyclical Reruns Novaruns. His Eminence Cardinal L. M. Parocchi, Hon: Presi-dent. The committee has in hand the compilation of a collection of written opinions on the Encyclical (Reruns Novarson) and on its practical application. Until now, all the crowned heads of Europe, the episcopacy, and the most celebrated men of social sciencs have contributed to the work; and we are able to state that this demonstration of sympathy with his far-seeing views, has gladdened the heart of Leo XIII If by chance you have not taken part, we beg you to regard yourself as earnestly invited by this circular to do so at your earliest convenience. At this moment, more-over, the same committee is engaged in the compilation of statistics of all the practical works for the benefit of the working classes which have either been called into existence by the words of the Supreme Pontiff, or have brought themselves into conformity with the lines of action traced out in the encyclical. Hence, the committee earnestly begs you to second it in this undertaking by kindly writing answers to the ques-tions here enclosed. Then follows a blank form containing these questions, the answers to which are to be appended :- Number, names and location of workingmen's socie-ties, date of foundation, number of members. What percentage of total number of workingmen belong to the societies ? By whom are they managed ? Are there workingmen's banks ? What is the capital of each ? Has the encyclical produced an effect upon these societies ? The document closes with a space for the signature and residence of the sender, with the direction to forward to the Rev. Dr. Richard L. Burtsell, Rondout, New York. It was said that this commission, which has been given to Dr.- Burtsell at  the instance of the pope, may have some influence in hastening his return, for it is likely that the desired statistics should be prepared and transmitted as soon as pos-sible.

History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the stand-ard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new form of paganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.

The Law of God as Changed by the Papacy Is the title of a large Chart just issued, which shows in a striking manner the blasphemous pre-tentions of the Papal power. The testimony of the Best Catholic Authorities is given, and shows, by quoting their own words, that Sunday is a child of the Catholic Church. These quotations, together with admissions from standard Catholic works, are arranged in parallel columns on either side of this Chart, while the center column contains the Ten Commandments as taught by the Catholic Church. The whole forms a collection of extracts of incalcu-lable value for every Bible student. The Charts are three by four feet in size, and are printed on heavy map cloth in bold type, easily read across the largest room. Price, Post-paid, $1,00.
