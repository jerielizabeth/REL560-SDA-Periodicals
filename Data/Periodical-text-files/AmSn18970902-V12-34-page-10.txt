538 AMERICAN SENTINEL. WE have opened this department for the express pur-pose of directly introducing ourselves to the younger portion of the large and growing SENTINEL family, in whom Łwe feel a deep personal interest. Soon they will enter life's duties in earnest, and it should be with the widest comprehension of what that implies. We shall seek to fill the department with matter interesting, timely and instructive. We hope it will meet a genuine demand, and help to awaken a lively interest in one of the most vital subjects that can engage the attention of young people at this time. A Short Talk on Natural Rights. ONE of the first things that it is important every in-dividual should have some knowledge of, is the subject of natural rights. We cannot ignorerights. We have rights of our own; which we want other people to repeat. And other people have rights, which we ought to respect, but are not always careful to respect. No one is too young to possess rights. They belong as well to the baby in its cradle, as to the grown-up man or woman. Nothing comes more natural to the average little boy or girl than to want to do something which will interfere with somebody's rights. Of course, they do not think of t in this way; they are thinking of their own amusement or of getting something that they want. They like to tease little folks smaller than themselves, just to see them get angry without being able to "pay back." They are quite apt to believe that "might makes right," or at least to act among their playmates as if they believed this. They do this withoutŁ  thinking of anything but their own amusement and satisfaction, but when they are treated in this way themselves, they have a keen sense of its injustice. They feel instinctively that they have rights, which are being invaded. The rights that we and all other people have, come from God, and this is what makes them sacred., What God gives us, nobody has any right to take from -us. God meant that we should all have rights or privileges, and be free to enjoy. them: and anyone who interferes with them is interfering with the plans of God. It is a shock-ing thing that a mere creature of God's hand should seek to amuse and gratify himself by marring the designs of the Creator. God is our Creator. He gave all living creatures thei life, and he gave it so that they might enjoy it. He did not make any of his creatures to be miserable. So every person has a right to life and a right to liberty, and such things as he must have to enjoy life. This is what some of the great men who lived here a hundred years ago, said in the famous Declaration of Independence. Here are some of their words : "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pur-suit of happiness." These truths, they said, are " self-evident ;" that means that they are so plain that no ar-gument is needed to prove them. It means that every-body who has intelligence ought to know without being told, that God has given all persons an unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So then we all ought to know this much about the subject of natural rights. And we ought to act as though we knew it, too. Most young boys are very apt to forget, or to act as if they never knew, that all God's creatures have a right to life and happiness just the same as man has. For instance, as they walk through the fields or woods and spy a bird upon the fence or the limb of a tree, their first thought, very likely, is to find a stone or other missile to throw at it. They do not mean to be cruel; they are only thoughtless; but thoughtlessness is one of the worst things in the world. Thoughtlessness causes a terrible amount of suffering, not only to the lower animals, but to human beings. Let us suppose, my boy, that your aim was true, that the stone did what you meant it to do, and the bird dropped dead to the ground. What have you done? You have taken away life; but can you give life? No; you could not put life into the very small-est insect. The greatest man in the world, or all the men in the world together, could not do it. It required infin-ite power and wisdom to give life to that little bird; but you, just for a moment's "fun," have taken this away, and it is gone forever. The great God gave that little bird a right to life; he gave it power to fly through the air, he gave it a joyous freedom, an eye to be pleased with nature's beatiful forms and colors; he gave it a right to the enjoyment of these things: and this God-given right you and other equally thoughtless boys take away just for the "fun" of it. What must the great Creator think of such cruel and wantom interference with his plans? Is he pleased with it, do you think ? But boys are not the only ones to blame; far from it. Think of the deliberate slaughtering of these beautiful feathered creatures of God's hand, just to enable silly girls and women to conform to the fashion of wearing birds in their hats! Fashion is one of the cruelest things in the world. And in this case it is one of the wickedest. And yet some people who call themselves Christians will take away the most sacred God-given rights from his creatures, just to conform to worldly fashion.
