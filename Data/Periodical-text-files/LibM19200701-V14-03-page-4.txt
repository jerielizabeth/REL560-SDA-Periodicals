Ł Ł Ł Ł Ł Ł The Poets' Prayer for Liberty Whittier wrote during the midnight darkness of the Civil War: Ł " If, for the age to come, this hour Of trial have vicarious power, And, blessed by Thee, our present pain Be Liberty's eternal gain, Ł Thy will be done! " John Hay continues the prayer: " Thy will! It bids the weak be strong; It bids the strong be just; Ł No lip to fawn, no hand to beg, Ł No brow to seek the dust. Ł Wherever man oppresses man Ł Beneath thy liberal sun, Ł Ł O Lord be there, thine arm made bare, Ł Thy righteous will be done." Ł Ł In these beautiful lines from James Russell Lowell, is found assur- Ł ance of the answer: Ł " Careless seems the great Avenger; History's pages but record One death grapple in the darkness 'Twixt old systems and the Word; Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,Š Yet that scaffold sways the future, And, behind the dim unknown, Standeth God within the shadow, Keeping watch above his own."
