 284 AMERICAN SENTINEL.        "From the sea." "You recall the fact that water is a symbol of multi-tudes, nations, and tongues as we learn in Rev. 17:15. "The beast rose from an inhabited place, and merely organized the people, nations and tongues into its own spirit and system. The government symbolized under the two-horned beast grows out of the earth, as a plant. This is the original meaning of the verb. From the time of the landing of the pilgrims, who fled from the oppres-sion of the beast for 'freedom to worship God,' until the present hour, the United States has been growing as a plant, reaching out its roots into unacquired soil, spread-ing its branches into new atmosphere. "What is the next specification?" "And he had two horns like a lamb." "What is_the chief characteristic of a lamb?" "Harmlessness, meekness, inoffensiveness, I should say." "Yes. What difference is marked between these horns like a lamb and the ten horns?" "The ten horns represent the monarchical form of government. But the two horns of the lamb represent something inoffensive and full of liberty. For what two civil and religious principles has our Government stood as a distinctive exponent?" "For the principles of civil and religious liberty." `'Yes; in our country the value of the principles enun-ciated by Christ has been demonstrated, and these two principles may well be represented by the harmless sym-bol here presented. Christ bade men to render unto Cmsar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. Church and state have been kept separate by these harmless principles that have their origin in the Lamb of God. Had they always been incul-cated in the functions of government, the bloody acts that have disgraced the annals of history would never have appeared. The Constitution of our country forbids Congress the making of laws that will prohibit men the free use of their religious rights, to worship God accord-ing to the dictates of their conscience, does not require any religious test to qualify for office, and holds all men equal before the law." "0, but mama, times have changed since Thomas Jefferson and the framers of our Constitution lived. If religious tests are not now required, it certainly will not be long before they will be required. Can't you see your-self that a great change has come over the people? Last summer all the ministers preached on religious legisla-tion,'and urged the church to take a lively interest in politics, and especially to vote for the enforcement of Sunday laws. They even enrolled their congregation by a standing vote as in favor of petitioning Congress for such enforcement. Bills and bills have been presented. Here is a note from a late paper that says, 'Strong or-ganizations are being marshaled to get the passage of a Sunday rest bill.' Petitions are going to Congress for a reversal of the principles of civil and religious liberty." "Yes, Charlie, I have seen ail this; but did not know that you were becoming so well informed. This very change is indicated by the prophet. What inconsistent,  combination do we find in the symbol?" "And he spike as a dragon." "Here is foretold a striking reversal of policy. The inconsistency of the symbols has already been made clear in the manner in which dissenters have been treated. The Puritans banished Roger Williams, whipped Quakers, and burned witches; and though men have laughed at;  the idea that this wonderful Government should ever again indulge in the spirit of the Dark Ages, yet in the last ten years observers of the seventh day Sabbath have suffered for their faith by the enforcement of religious laws that conflicted with the law of God. Men have lan-guished in prison, and have died as the result. In the South they have been relegated to the chain gang, de-pendent women and children have been the victims of religious bigotry backed by unrighteous legislation. Some of the leaders in the movement for Sunday enforce-ment have put themselves on record as determined to push such legislation for the sole purpose of oppression. Of course the masses who are not acquainted with his-tory, who do not understand prophecy, who cannot see the logical outcome of a union of church and state in our land, honestly think that Sunday laws would be a great benefit. Brought up to regard Sunday as a holy day, it pains them to see it turned into a holiday. Avaricious employers take advantage of our freedom, to compel their employes to labor, and the zealous Reformers, some honestly and some dishonestly, plead for the working man's right to rest one day in seven." "Well, that's so, mama; it does seem as if the people's right to rest would be interfered with unless some kind of a law could be established." "Charlie, who gave men a right to rest one day in seven?" "God did." "Cannot the God who gave protect that right?" "Yes, mama; but"Š "But there's no but about it. Who could take away my right to observe the Sabbath, or the rest that God has given? It is simply a matter of asserting and claim-ing the right that is involved." "But, mama, if a working man did assert and claim his right, he would be thrown out of his position, and starvation for himself and family would stare him in the face." "No, indeed, Charlie; God provides for such an emer-gency. He says, 'Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall Łbe added unto you.' The right to rest, and there can be no Sabbath rest without worship, is based solely on the command of God. This command must be obeyed by faith that acŁ knowledges its possessor wholly dependent on God. He who claims he cannot exercise his God-given rights with-out the power of human law, casts reproach upon God. All are free to do what God commands, and he who is all
