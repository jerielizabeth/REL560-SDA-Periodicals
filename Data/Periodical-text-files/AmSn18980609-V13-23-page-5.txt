AMERICAN SENTINEL. 357 He who said "according to your faith," had seen the need, recognized the determination, and had provided a woman to meet it in Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, of Boston, Mass. By many rare gifts of opportunity, culture, and by peculiar steadfastness of conviction she had been made ready to seize the opportune moment. IF laws could make men good, man could become his own saviour, and the fundamental doctrine of heathen-ism would be vindicated as truth. The Everlasting Gospel. BY C. H. KESLAKE. IN the last four articles of this series attention was called to the solemn warning found in Rev. 14:9-11 against the worshiping of the beast and his image, and the receiving of the beast's mark in the forehead or in the hand. It was pointed out in part why it could be that the unmingled wrath of God could be poured out in the manner described. Further study of this question will make it still plainer. The text above referred to reads: "And the third angel followed them," etc. Going back to the sixth verse and reading from thence onward, we have brought to view three angels, the one mentioned in verse 6 being the first of the three. Of the second and third angels it is said that they "followed" the first angel. This does not mean that they followed each other in succession, each taking up his work when the preceding one had finished his particular work. The meaning of this word "fol-lowed" will be seen by referring to 1 Cor. 10:4, where precisely ;the same word is used. The text reads, "And did all drink the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ." The marginal rendering of the word "fol-lowed" is "went with them." Thus it will be seen that the word "followed" in the Scripture before us signifies "to go with." It is important to bear this in mind, as the meaning of them will be more clearly seen. It is as though it read, "And the second angel went with him," etc.; "And the third angel went with them." The idea, therefore, is that soon after the first one begins his work, the second and third angels unite themselves to the first angel, and then they all go together; their messages be-coming a three-fold message. This proves that the people to whom the message of the third angel is proclaimed have the others proclaimed to them also. It has been proven in these articles (1) that the beast of Rev. 13:1-10 and the two horned beast of verse 11 are respectively the papacy and the United States; and (2) that Sunday is the mark of the papacy. It has also been clearly proven that the work having in view the  enforcing of Sunday upon the consciences of the people is now being done. Therefore the conclusion is inevitable-that the three messages under consideration are to be-proclaimed at the same time and to the same people. That being so, the attention of the people must now-be called to these messages just as they read. That this is being done no one who cares to investigate can possibly deny. What is the burden of the message of the first angel? It reads (Rev. 14:6,7), "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell upon the earth, to every na-tion, kindred, tongue, and people; saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters." There is only one gospel by which sinners are to be brought into harmony with their CreatorŠthe gospel of Jesus Christ. It is therefore the gospel of Christ that is thus proclaimed in the scripture under consideration; not the gospel in part, but the whole. That being so, it is evident that the words, "Fear God, and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters," include all that God can possibly require, and all that man can possibly renderŠno more, no less. It is perfectly natural that when the prophecy of Rev. 13:11-18 is being fulfilled and the work of compelling homage to the beast (papacy) by the enforced reception of its mark (Sunday) is going on, the gospel, demanding that worship be rendered to the Creator, to whom it be-longs, should be proclaimed. It must be clear to every candid mind that with the preaching of the everlasting gospel at this time, there caŁn be left no possible excuse for anyone's worshiping the creature instead of the Creator. What does the gospel require?ŠThat we fear God and give glory to him. Anything that detracts from this cannot possibly be the gospel. Before pointing out what is involved in the thought of fearing God and giving glory to him, it will be well to remark that at this time when the gospel is to be preached in the form in which it is here given, there must be some object, other than God, that man has been fearing; some object to whom or to which man has been giving glory: And further, we can see from the prophecy that the at-tempt at least will be made to continue this. It is also natural that this gospel should be preached,  at this time, and with direct reference to the prophecy before us, in which the question of religious liberty is in-volved. When the consciences of all men are thus sought to be enslaved, even of those who in theory believe in religious liberty and in separation of church and state, what more fitting thing could be doneŠwhat less could a gracious God doŠthan to cause the gospel of Christ to. be preached, through which alone true religious liberty-can ever be obtained.
