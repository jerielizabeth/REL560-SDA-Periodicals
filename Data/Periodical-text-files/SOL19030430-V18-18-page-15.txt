Jones' book entitled "THE TWO REPUBLICS" is a comparative study of the underlying principles of the two greatest RepublicsŠRome and the United States. "The principle of Rome in all its phases is that religion and government are insepa-rable. The principle of the government of the United States is that religion is essentially distinct and wholly separate from civil government, and entirely exempt from its cog-nizance. "As it was Christianity that first and always antagonized this governmental principle of Rome, and established the governmental principle of the United States of America, the fundamental idea, the one thread-thought of the whole book, is to develop the princi-ples of Christianity with reference to civil government, and to portray the mischievous results of the least departure from tbose principles." Rome occupies one extreme and the United States the other. Which is right? The question interests every reader of THE SENTINEL, for in its solution and the correct appli-cation of the principles lies the salvation of individual as well as nation. "Two Republics" contains 895 octa'bo pages and is substantially bound in cloth. Price, postpaid, $1.75. Complete catalog of publications mailed on request.
