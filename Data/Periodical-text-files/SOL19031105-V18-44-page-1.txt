The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., NOVEMBER 5, 1903 NO. 44 Religious liberty is liberty of conscience; and conscience is an INDIVIDUAL affair. Therefore religious liberty is liberty for the individual, and that "religious liberty" which is permitted only to classes and aggregations of individuals is not religious liberty. "Any law enacted to enforce conformity to any religious tenet carries 'with it intrinsic evidence of its unrighteous character; for if people conscientiously believed in the tenet favored by the law, no law would be necessary to enforce it. The very existence of such a law implies the design to enforce the tenet upon those who do not con-scientiously belle2re in it; and a more palpable 'Notation of the holy rights of conscience can scarcely be imagined." If no question of conscience can be involved when "the law of the land" is concerned, then there has been no question of conscience in7rolved in almost all the religious persecution of the world, and the changes in and abrogation of laws and statutes which has been one of the most important features and accompaniments of the advance to religious freedom have been entirely unnecessary. The fact is that nearly all religious intolerance that has brought oppression and persecution has in the nature of things been always a question "of the law of the land." It is that loery thing that has made religious intolerance so intolerable, and that has enabled it so terribly to outrage human rights. Let us have done with this pitiable talk of "the law of the land" in justification of the inloasion of the religious and civil liberty of men by the enforcement upon them of a religious observance. i PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR PUBLICATION OFFICE : 222 NORTH CAPITOL STREET, WASHINGTON, D.
