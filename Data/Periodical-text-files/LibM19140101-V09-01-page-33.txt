OE IV ME A TRUE American is one who wants all men to enjoy what he enjoys. tV ttE RELIGION and Christianity flourished most when they met and overcame oppo-sition without the aid of the civil powers. OE IV RE A RELIGION that cannot survive honest criticism and defend itself without ap-peal to carnal weapons is a false religion. ftF  tV CIVIL and religious liberty can thrive and survive only when all citizens -are granted equal-  privileges before the law. fÂ¥V  flf FREE speech is possible only when, without recrimination, one allows the other person to say what he wants to say.
