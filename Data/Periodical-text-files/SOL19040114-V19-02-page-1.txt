Sunday=Law Oppression in Philadelphia Again PUBLISHED WEEKLY ,.. ./ ) sentinel  CHRISTIAN LIBERTY OF .  The  VOL. XIX WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 14, 1904 NO. 2 /  Ni It is not they who oppose but they who advocate and carry on Sunday enforcement who in that thing are not and cannot be Christians. cMen who "protect their olvn rights" by violating the rights of others need to be rebuked and restrained when they "protect their own rights." When it comes to Sunday enforcement the real, genuine law-breakers are those who advocate and uphold it, not those who rebuke and condemn it. The truly law-abiding and Christian citizen does not demand and engage in any "law" enforcement bhich out-rages the rights of his fellow-citizens. "Disrespect for the Sunday law" is exactly what its character invites, and Irhat none are doing more to promote than those who are having it enforced. It is not the presentment of the Philadelphia grand jury, but the crusaae of the Philadelphia "Sabbath" Association that is "very strange in the light of intelligent civilization." No, the Christian will not "fa'bor a disregard of the Sabbath day," and neither Ivill he fa'bor a disregard of the fundamental Christian rule with regard to all religious ob-servances, "Let ebery man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
