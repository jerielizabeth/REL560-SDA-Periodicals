"THE ravages of war, although somewhat kept in the background, were not entirely stopped," said Pro-fessor Carman, as he arose and began his visit with his pupils. "Why, professor," said Will Barnaby, "I thought that the plague was the means of stopping the war with the English." "It was, practically speaking, at least for the time being, for the French were in no condition to fight. But the English king roamed around all over the country, wherever he chose to go, making conquests of cities and villages, as he wished,Šthe wretched inhabitants almost utterly incapable of helping themselves or of offering any resistance." "Did King John feel any like fighting back?" asked Jennie Jacobs, "or didn't he care so long as he had a good time?" "Yes, he did care, and began to prepare to drive Edward out of France. So at last John, and the Black Prince, son of Edward, met near Poitiers, the same place where Clovis fought and defeated the Visigoths In this battle the English were the victors, and King John and his youngest son, Philip, a boy of only fourteen years,Šwho really behaved himself more bravely than his three older brothers,Šwere taken prisoners and carried off in triumph to England." "I suppose King Edward was glad to be able to vent his spite on the French king and prince," suggested Will Palmeter. "No, Will; you are quite wrong in your opinion, for really they were very kindly treated. "About this time we have the strange spectacle of a king voluntarily giving up his kingdom and throne to another. This was the king of Dauphiny, that country in the southeast of what we now call France, lying be-tween the river Rhone and the Alps. Other kings sacri-ficed the lives of their subjects and everything dear, to acquire more territory and to become great in the eyes of mankind. But unlike them, this man grew weary of the life of a prince, and he wished to become a humble monk. So he agreed to give his kingdom to Charles, the son of John, and afterward called The Wise." "I wonder the king of Dauphiny's son did not oppose this thing," said practical Jack. "I presume he would have, but as it happened, there  was no son, so the D luphin Charles took possession of the easily acquired territory. ŁHowever it was agreed beforehand that Dauphiny should never belong to France, and that when a prince of Dauphiny succeeded to the French throne, he must lay down his title to Dauphiny, which, of course, he would naturally give to his eldest son." "Where was King John all this time?" asked Edna Phillips . "He and his young son were having a very comfort-able time in England as Edward's royal prisoners. After a little the Dauphin took it upon himself to try to collect money from the impoverished people, with which to ran-som the king and his son." "I don't see how it was possible to get much money from the poor peasants in such a time as this," whispered Max Smith. "It was indeed like taking their heart's blood," sighed Professor Carman. "But they were wise enough to de-clare that they would not pay a copper until the king agreed to cease corrupting the coin, and until the Dauphin promised to take no more of the people's money for his private use." "I suppose he would not agree to that," commented Will Palmeter. "Yes, he said he would agree; but he deceived them most wickedly until they finally rose up in their anger and killed two of his counsellors, and had it not been that the leader of the insurgents listened to the Dauphin's piteous cry for mercy, they would have killed him as well." "It's a wonder they didn't kill him before he had time to beg," said Edna Phillips, excitedly. "It was the red cap, the sign of the revolution, which the leader hastily put on the Dauphin's head, which saved him, more than his begging. "The situation among the peasants was so unendur-able that they rose up also, while this trouble was brew-ing in Paris, and the terrible Jacquerie insurrection took place, in which the poor wretches seemed to care only to vent their rage on the rich. They tortured them cruelly before taking their lives, so they might know how it felt to suffer as they declared. Brutal and terrible as it was one can hardly wonder at it, considering their great provocation. There seemed to be nothing too dreadful for the frenzied wretches to do. The peasants had been placed in a horrible condition; even their grain which they had secreted for seed had been seized, with all their miserable possessions, to raise the money with which to redeem their detested king. In the language of a French writer, 'Something perhaps might still be got out of him; perhaps he had some hiding place where he kept his money, so they scorched his feet. Neither fire nor iron was spared.' "It seems as though they had so very much trouble! It is dreadful to hear about it," said Julia March. "But Aunt Eunice says she thinks the times are getting to be
