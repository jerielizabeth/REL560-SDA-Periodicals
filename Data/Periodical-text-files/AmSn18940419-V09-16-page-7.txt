AAIIIHArt,r cA.N STE NWINIE,IL,0 127 to property, but for the fact that it paves the way for a still greater and more vital discrimination with reference to principle and personal freedom of action in the choice of religion. Discrimination with reference to church property, argues a right to discriminate with reference to anything that belongs to the Church as contradistinguished from what belongs to that portion of mankind not of the Church. This involves a legal construction of the term church, in which there must neces-sarily be an investigation of rites, ordi-nances, forms of worship, authority, etc. So, religious people, by accepting at the Government's hands the favor of freedom from taxation for their churches, and other church property, have not only tacitly conceded the Government's right to discriminate with reference to property and determine which is and which is not church property, and hence what is and what is not a church; but have also log-ically conceded to the same political power the right to make still further and keener discriminations touching the religious lib-erties of the people in matters of con-science and forms of worship. No people can be said to be entirely free, if while faithful to the government, they are placed at any disadvantage by reason of personal opinions touching mat-ters over which the government proposes to have no control. But so long as free-dom from taxation is granted to church property, while other public property is taxed, those holding the non-taxable pub-lic property have an advantage over those holding the taxable public property, which is granted to them far no other reason than that they hold a certain opinion, or profess to hold it, touching the subject of religion. So long as this is the case, can we say that thought is unfettered touching the subject of religion, and that a man's opinions thereon do not affect his standing in the government ? One class are suc-cessful candidates for government favor; the other class to an equal extent are made to feel the government's disfavor, and all because of a difference of opinion touching religion. If men's property may be fav-ored because of their religion, the men themselves may be favored for the same reason. The precedent is a dangerous one, and its danger should not be un-known.ŠIndependent Patriot, Lamoni, Iowa. -  Alabama Imitates Louisiana. THE following dispatch,-from Birming-ham, Ala., will set people tinking whether we live in America or Russia. Read and be astonished :Š BIRMINGHAM, ALA., Mar. 24.ŠTroy, Ala., is excited over whitecap notices which have been received by mail by prominent Jewish merchants of that town. The notices are confined to the Jews, nearly all of whom have received them. A notice received by Levin & Sons, says:Š GENTS: This is warning for you to leave the city. We will give you until May 15th to wind up your business and get out of the city. After that date if you are caught in the city you will be dealt with as snakes are. You know our rule is never to give second warning hut to act, therefore do not let your friends persuade you to stay. WECAPS. P. C. D. F. A WHIT  President. A notice received by Rosenberg Bros., says unless they leave by May 15th, they will be hanged by the neck. The citizens 'are highly indignant over the out-rages. Troy is a town of 5,000 inhabitants. The Governor of Alabama, to his credit be it said, has taken every precaution to prevent fanatical outrages. The United States authorities have also been notified. We should not wonder in the least if some of our threatened co-religionists in the sunny South should pack up and leave.ŠJewish Times and Observer, April 6, 1894. RELIGIOUS LIBERTY LIBRARY.

The above is the title of a treatise written by the author, at the request of the Ministerial Union of Los Angeles, California. It grew out of a discussion upon the present aspect and aims of The Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the author taking the ground that the rise, progress, present and future condition of the temporal power known as the Papacy, or Vaticanism, Is Outlined in the Prophecies of Holy Scriptures, with sufficient accuracy to determine what the " Papacy " is, and what is to be its future develop-ment and ultimate end.

History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the stand-ard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new form of paganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.
