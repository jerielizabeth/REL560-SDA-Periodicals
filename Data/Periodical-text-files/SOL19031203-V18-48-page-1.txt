The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII WASHINGTON, D. C., DECEMBER 3, 1903 NO. 48 "Before the state can teach religion it must have a relig-ion to teach. But the state being not a single indirbidual, but an aggregation of individuals, it can halm a religion only in the sense of having a creed which it fosters. Are Americans ready for that ? " "The office and object of the teaching of the church is to make good men, while the office and object of the teaching of the state is to make good citizens; and the fail-ure of the church so to carry on its instruction as to make good men will never justify the state in going beyoud its sphere to attempt that itself." "If Protestants 'want Protestant schools, let them pay for such schools with Protestant money. If Roman Catho-lics want Roman Catholic schools, let them pay for such schools with Catholic money. If Jews "Want JeTvish schools, let them pay for such schools with JelPish money. But let not Protestants, Roman Catholics and Jews com-bine to tax the Uhole community in order to create a public fund, and, 'When it is created, engage in a struggle to see which of them can get the largest share of it."
