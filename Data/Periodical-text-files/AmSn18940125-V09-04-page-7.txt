Our goods are shipped to every part of the worldŠto Australia, New Zealand, India, Persia, and other foreign countries, as well as to all parts of the United States; and in every instance they have demonstrated their wonderful keeping properties. The following are a few of the hundreds of testimonials received from persons who have for years made use of our foods. MICHIGAN. I have for three years used the " Health Foods" in my family, and can heartily recommend them, both for purity and health- giving properties. C. F. PORTER, D. D. S. INDIANA. Your "Health Foods " are the wonder of the nineteenth century. I have used Granola but a short time, but have already experienced relief from indigestion and acid, or flatulent dyspepsia.. I also find the Zwiebach nourishing and toothsome. D. M. KAUFFMAN. I have personally tested your excellent food known as Granola. It is highly pleasing to the taste, easy of digestion, and the most nutritive cereal production with which I am acquainted. DR. R. W. BULA. NEW YORK. Your Granola is the best selling invalid food I have ever handled, I have already sold nearly two thousand pounds. A. J. BROUGHTON. CONNECTICUT. We have used your "Health Foods" in our family for three years, and can not. get along without them. Having been troubled with dyspepsia and chronic inflammation of the stomach, I find that your Granola, Aveuola, Wheatena, and Gluten are the only foods that I can eat with safety. Wm. M. MERWIN. OHIO. Our baby is a testimonial to Sanitarium food, She is ten months old, weighs twenty-eight pounds, and is as ruddy and healthy a specimen as can he seen. She has actually gained flesh while cutting her last two teeth. Her flesh is firm and sound, and she is very strong. FRED. L. ROSEMOND: We have twins, and the little fellows are thriving nicely.

JANUARY 25, 1894. gTENTINIHALA., 31 " THE czar and the pope," remarks an exchange, " have exchanged autograph letters on the religious situation. It is believed that the disposition on the part of Russia and the Vatican to reestablish a religious entente is firmer than ever." It is said that when rogues fall out honest men get their dues; but what happens when tyrants are made friends? If the future is to be judged from the past no good can come to true Christians by any understanding between the pope and the czar. It was over the arrest and trial of Christ that Herod and Pilate were made friends; and our Lord's crucifixion imme- diately followed. Ł-Ł-Ł  AN Albany judge has decided that the law of this State does not give the police authorities power to require the closing of saloons on Sunday. The decision is :Š There is no law, notwithstanding the opinion of the Chief of Police and the police commissioners, that prevents a man from keeping his saloon open on Sun-day. There is no law which prohibits a man from keeping his front door open or prohibits three, four or five, or a dozen people sitting in the saloon. There must be exposure. Men have the right to sit there and amuse themselves quietly in any way they see fit, so far as they do not violate the law by being disorderly or drinking. The doors can be locked or .unlocked. A man's saloon is his castle as much as his store or home. It is not within the power of the po-lice to slip into them. It is not their business. Of course this does not touch the ques-tion of selling liquor on Sunday, but only the power of the police authorities to re-quire the actual closing of the room in which liquors are sold. It shows, however, the great flexibility of the Sunday law where the liquor interests are involved. But while a man may actually keep his saloon open on Sunday, and there enjoy himself with his friends, he may not fish on Sunday in this State, even in his own private pond; for so the Court of Appeals of the great State of New York has de-cided. " This," remarks the World, " is in accordance with the attorney-general's recent ruling that the game and fish com-missioners have nothing to do with the  enforcement of the statute against Sunday fishing, because that statute was not en-acted for the preservation of fish, but for the preservation of the Sabbatarian char-acter of Sunday."
