"Render to Caesaz the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." The Author of Christianity Announcing the Perfect Principle of the Separation of Civil Government and Religion. The Parasees, thinking to entangle Christ in his talk, came to him and asked if it were lawful to give tribute to Caesar. "But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22: 15-22.
