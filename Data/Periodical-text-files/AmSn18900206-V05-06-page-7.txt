FATHERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BY ELDER E. J. WAGGONER. History repeats itself, because human nature is the same in all ages of the world. Hence, he who would know how to avoid error in the future must know how errors have developed in the past. The "Fathers of the Catholic Church" shows the con-dition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient ,heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of thes- principles by prominent men in the church, arylthe incautious lowering of the standard of par- Christianity, developed the Papacy, -which was simply a new phase of paganism. It shows that by the time of Constantine every phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the hook.
