12 AMEEICAN SENTINEL. "The path over whichŁ he marched with his ruffianly soldiers was red with the blood of his victims. Finally, at the battle of Chalons he was glad to retreat from the Romans. But so evenly matched were the two armies and so frightful had been the loss of each, that theRoman general did not think it wise to follow him." "I remember hearing papa read 'about Attila, once," said Florence Ray, "and I think he called himself the ' Hammer of the Universe.' "Yes; it was a dreadful title and well earned. Well," continued the professor, "the Roman Empire fell A. D. 476. That's right. I'm glad to see so many using their pencils, "After that the Franks had things pretty much their own way, and the country of Gaul began to be called Francia,' on account of them." "I've been wondering all this time, Professor," said Charlie White, "how the name of France came to be given to Gaul, and now I see." "We will now begin with Clovis, the first of the French kings, which you may write in your note books under date of 481 A. D.; but do not forget that although he was a French king, he 'did not at first really possess any of the country we now call France; so, really, he was only king of the Franks. He came to the throne when he was only fifteen years old. "Can you think of any other king mentioned in his-tory who was still younger than this?" Julia March, who was quite a Bible student, answered promptly that Josiah was only eight years old when he was made king of Israel. "Good. Well, when Clovis was twenty years old, he fought the battle of Soissons against the Romans, and being victorious, this put an end to Roman rule in Gaul. "King Clovis was wry revengeful in his disposition. Once when a foolish Frank displeased him by breaking a vase which the king wanted to preserve, he waited a whole year for his revenge, and then killed him with a battle ax, saying as he did so, 'So you did to the vase at Soissons.' I am sure you will all agree with me that King Clovis needed to be converted. He did profess con-version a while after this, but from his conduct we fear he was not wholly free from the folly of paganism. "We must remember that these German conquerors of Gaul, for a number of hundred years were really as much German in heart and language as ever even though they lived in their conquered territory. So we ought hardly to think of them as French. "Finally, King Clovis married the beautiful niece of the king of Burgundy. Her name was Clotilda, and she was a Christian. But the term 'Christian' in those days did not mean as much as it dOes-to-day. People were called Christians if they had renounced paganism, even though they still held many of its errors. The uncle did not like to give his niece to a pagan, but he did not dare to refuse the great king who had defeated his relatives, - the Romans. "When a little child was born to them, Queen Clo-tilda had her way, and the little fellow was christened, as the custom was. Afterward, when the child died, its pagan father declared that this was the reason. "At last, because he was successful 'in a great battle against the Germans, he kept a vow he had made, and was baptized. This occurred on Christmas day, 49b A.D. Now the people began to pull together more than they had done. King Clovis was keen enough to see that the church had begun to be a very important element of power; so he made the bishops his best friends. Then he began to think of enlarging his dominions." Joe Palmeter was getting wonderfully excited. His eyes were shining, and Professor Carman saw that he wanted to ask a question. "Well, Joseph, what is it?" "Why, I don't see how or whythebislioPs and preach-ers could help King Clovis very much. I should think soldiers would be the best help to get territory." "That's the way it ought to have been; but we see that the church and state were on terms of the closest intimacy." "Well," said Julia March, "I thought Christ said at one time that his kingdom was not of this world." "So he did; but they paid small heed to that in those days; in fact, in all-  ages of the world there have always been some who have ignored his teachings in this respect. "The king soon became master of Burgundy, and now his ambitious eyes were turned toward the Visigoths in the South. They did not believe in the same form of Christianity that Clovis did since his baptism, and so the foolish king made this an excuse for fighting them, which was indeed a poor manner of bringing them to his way of thinking. "Now King Clovis was getting to be so famous that he must have a capital. So he fixed upon a little village named Lutetia,' originally, but the Romans had given it the name of ' Paris.' This was about 500 A. D." As those who had note books hastened to write this down as a good point, the teacher said:Š "Now as I see my half hour is up, I will dismiss you. But will ask you at the next study to mention the points which most impressed you to-day, and it will help you to fix the facts in your mind." "I'm so glad I came," said Florence Ray, on the road home that afternoon. `Yes," said Edna Phillips, "I'm going to coax Johnnie to attend next time." MRS. L. D. AVERY-STUTTLE. WRY ought not the state to enforce morality? Does the church need the support of the state? If not, why? Is the saying true that "the state can do no wrong"? Why is it not true that "the voice of the people is the voice of God"?
