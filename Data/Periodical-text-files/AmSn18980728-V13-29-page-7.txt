KESLAKE. As THE question of the relation of the Sabbath to the gospel of Jesus Christ is considered, it is hoped that those who have followed us thus far in these articles will remember that not only has it been shown that Sunday is the mark of the papacyŠwhich is the power symbol ized by the beast of Rev. 13 :1,Šbut also, that the power symbolized by the two-horned beast of Rev. 13:11, which is to enforce this mark upon the consciences of the people, is the United States. It must be remembered too that the burden of the gospel message of Rev. 14:6, 7, calling upon all to "fear God and give glory to him," etc., and which is really a call to keep the commandments of God, is with direct reference to the mark of the beastŠno matter for the moment what such mark might denoteŠwhich is thus to be enforced. Remembering all this, it will be seen that the time will come when the power of this nation will be arrayed against the gospel of Jesus Christ. In addition to the proofs that have already been adduced that this country is the one symbolized by the two-horned beast, it will be our duty to show that public opinion is being so molded that it is now being seen(?) that the interests of this nation are identical with the mission of the gospel to the extent that anything said antagonistic to what will be regarded as the gospel will be regarded as antagonistic to this Government, and the subversion of the one be regarded as the subversion of the other. Indeed some evidence has already been set forth in these articles that this is so, but we purpose presenting more in subsequent articles. For the present we wish to deal with the question of the Sabbath in its relation to the gospel, and thus fur-ther show that it is impossible that Sunday can be any-thing, else than antagonistic to the gospel. In our last article it was shown that those who are laboring so earnestly to have Sunday enforced by civil law, frankly confess that one's whole attitude to the gospel is determined by their attitude to the Sabbath (Sunday) thus setting forth that the Sabbath, is the supreme test. We do not for a moment think that such a conclusion has been reached in a haphazard way or that they are in any sense arbitrary; on the contrary we believe they are perfectly logical. Ł At first it was recognized by only the few who started this Sunday-enforced-by-law movement; but as others have been drawn into it they too have seen it, so that now multitudes seeing the logic of the thing accept it. And it is only a question of time when all will see it. That being so, we do not for one moment wish to dodge the issue; we firmly believe as much as they, that the Sabbath is the test of one's loyalty to the gospel. The only question with us is, which day is the Sabbath which is thus a test? But whichever day it is, we are uncompromisingly opposed to its being enforced by law. That phase of the question will also be considered later on. Some there are who profess to believe it does not matter which day is the Sabbath. To reason thus is puerile in the extreme, and is simply a begging of the question. But taking that-position, they cannot possi-bly help being on the wrong side of the question. There is a difference; and those who say there is none contradict themselves. The writer is personally acquainted with an estima-ble gentlemanŠa Christian doubtlessŠwho has repeat-edly contended that there is no difference, and yet has just as strongly contended that no matter what one be-lieves Sunday should be enforced by law. And further: while he freely acknowledges that there is not a particle of evidence for Sunday observance, and that the only Bible Sabbath is the seventh day, yet he believes there is a difference in that he observes the Sunday preferably to the seventh day, and as stated above, would have all men compelled to keep that day. Who cannot see that all such contradict themselves ? Now as the Sabbath is being set forth as the test or mark of one's loyalty to God and to the gospel, and as it is proposed to enforce Sunday as the Sabbath, it must be clear to all who will think, that upon the stand they take with reference to this matter they stake their allŠupon it they stake their eternal destiny. So much being involved in this question it becomes a matter of the highest importance that the Sabbath be studied earnestly and prayerfully. Is Sunday the Sabbath? Then it ought to be kept. Whether there is a civil law for its observance or not will not have a feather's weight with the one who loves the Lord. But the consequences being so great, there should be the clearest evidence that it is God's will that Sunday should be kept. It is not enough however to know that the day has been observed, and taught to others, by learned men. Even the greatest and best of them have been mistaken in some points of doctrine, and it is at least possible that they may be mistaken in this matter. No one will claim that error taught by even these thereby becomes the truth. Nor will it do to keep the Sunday simply because it is the law of the nation. In doing that one would be receiv-ing the day from a man or men as the case may be, for that is all the nation is comprised of. And to do this would be simply to put the nationŠmen, including him-self, for he is a part of the nationŠin the place of God. But he who does that, even allowing that Sunday is the right day, is lost.
