A thousand fuses have been attached and lighted by the dissatisfied elements. Instead of putting out the burning fuse, some are trying to prevent an explosion by clamping down the lid tighter over the mouth of the crater. Many hoped to see a new world created after the Great War. They dreamed of universal and lasting peace. Instead of peace we find trouble and discontent everywhere. The dove of peace has not yet been able to find a resting place. Nor is there a Utopia or asylum for the oppressed to which they can flee and there find rest.

They make no effort " to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free." They are not dealing their " bread to the hun-gry," nor bringing to their own houses " the poor that are cast out " because of exorbitant rents. Yet Isaiah says that the very essence of religion is that " when 67
