AMERICAN SENTINEL. 263 catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences." That this is true is proven from the fact that the foremost political institution of this countryŠCongressŠhas bent under it. During the time of the World's Fair at Chicago, the determination of the church people to have the fair closed on Sunday was so great that by persistent threats of inflicting political death upon the members, Congress finally yielded, and in so doing took it upon itself to declare, notwithstanding the commandment itself to the contrary, that the day required to be kept holy is "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." And it is only a question of time when all that isl'in ?that step will be fully developed, and the people oflthis nation be compelled to accept Sunday as the Sabbath day, or be subject to imprisonment, and even worse, as traitors to their country and to God. Sunday, it is claimed, is the mark of the nation whose God is the Lord. But the Lord is not yet officially rec-ognized as the king of this nation. But it is the deter-Ininat ion of a large religious elementŠthe National Re-form Association, the W. C. T. U., Christian Endeavor Society, and many other societiesŠthar "Christishall be this world's kingŠyea, verily, this world's king in its realm of cause and effectŠking of its courts, its camps, its commerce--king of its colleges and cloistersŠking of its customs and constitutions." It has gotten to be so now that anything:that passes under the name of Christianity is considered to be all right, and so without stopping to try:the spirits they just take it all in. But let it be remembered that in "all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated God's law." And consequently every religious persecution has been carried on to the "glory of God." Of course those who waged them never intended to persecute. When the papacy had control of the civil power it did not punish heretics but for the purpose of saving their souls. Or if the heretic was incorrigible he was only put out of the way so that others should not be contaminated by the deadly error. And so of this present movement to enthrone Christ .as this nation's king and to enforce the keeping of his laws(?)Šnotably the SundayŠthey do not intend to per-secute; they only intend that the law shall be obeyed. But all history attests the fact that there is nothing worse than a religious- bigot who has the opportunity to enforce his own ideas by law. But when they shall have succeeded in crowning Christ on "Capitol Hill," and he begins his benign reign, how shall the fact be known? Why, simply by the enforce-ment of his signŠhis markŠSunday. But, as before shown, Sunday is not the sign or mark of Christ. It is the mark of the papacy. And the very (essence of the papacy is the putting of a man in the place  of GodŠa man "who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, . . . so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:4. Hence, the enforcement of the Sunday will simply mean that by law man has been exalted to the place of God. As before said of those that will persecute, they do not intend to do this. So of this matter of exalting man in the place of God, they do not by any means intend to do this. But it will be done nevertheless. It was so in Christ's day. We have the testimony of the Holy Spirit himself that those who put Christ to death did not intend to slay the Lord of life and glory. 1 Cor. 2:8. Had they known that he was all this they would have drawn back horrified at the very thought of such a thing. But nevertheless they did it just as effect-ually as though they knew that he was the Lord of life and glory. And in doing it they fulfilled the prophecies that foretold it. How, then, does it come that those professed people of God could do such a thing. The apostle Paul gives us the answer in Acts 13:27, "For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him." They fulfilled the very Scriptures that they pro_ fessed to believe, and which were read in their hearing every Sabbath. How blind they must have been! But before we denounce them too severely let us be sure that we are not similarly situated. Let those who now read the prophets that foretold the death of Christ and how it was to be doneŠhaving the same Scriptures before them, which they profess to believe, see if they may not be engaged in a similar work. Had the Jews known him and the voices of the proph-ets, they would not have done what they did. And were the voices of the prophets known and believed now, men would not be seeking to put a man in the place of God. The Jews of old were told over and over again, and were shown from the Scriptures that he whom they ulti-mately put to death was verily the Christ, but they re-fused to believe it. So it is to day. Over and over again the people have been told the truth, and the prophecies set before them that foretell what will be done in this country, but like those of old, they refuse to believe. And their very unbelief leads them to fulfil the Scriptures against themselves. But a few saw the truth back there; thank God there will be those who will see it now. "As to [Sunday] amusements, it seems to me that the less we depend upon legislation and the more upon education and the pressure of public opinion to keep the day from degenerating into one of mere self-indulgence, the better. It is putting Christianity in a false and igno-ble position to even make it appear that her power and indeed her very existence are involved in a law-protected Sunday."ŠRev. Hugh Pedley.
