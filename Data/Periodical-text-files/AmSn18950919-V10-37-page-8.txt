296 .TOIMELI CAW SENTIPINITILI., VoL. 10, No. 37. NEW YORE, SEPTEMBER 19, 1895. far* ANY one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. BE sure to read the notice of " Two Repub-lics," on the preceding page. The book has been revised and new matter added bringing it up to date. Everybody ought to have the revised edition. Ł DOWN in Richmond, Va., if report be true, the Sunday law " reformers " have had the courage to take a step towards consistency in the enforcement of Sunday " laws," and have secured a municipal order stopping the street railway service on that day. It is altogether probable, however, that such consistency would, in most of our large cities, be fatal to an increase of the Sunday congregation, which is the real object sought in the crusade for compulsory Sunday rest. THE Spanish translation of the New Testa-ment which is issued by the American Bible Society, has taken a decided step in advance of the English and other versions, from the standpoint of belief in divine honor for Sun-day. It makes the translation of the first clause of Rev. 1: 10, read: " I was in the spirit on Sunday," instead of the common rendering, " I was in the spirit on the Lord's day." Thus, by the authority and word of man, Sunday has at last obtained Scriptural recognition. This proof for Sunday will do to add to that furnished by Congress in 1892, when it voted that Sunday was the Sabbath. THE Gainesville (Ga.) Eagle, of August 29, says :Š A man has been heavily fined in New Jersey for chopping some wood Sunday morning to cook break-fast with it. Little things like vote buying, corrupt-ing legislators, bribing jurors, and running gambling dens are overlooked in that State, but the Sunday law is preserved and upheld in all its seventeenth century sanctity. This is news to us. It may be true, how-ever. New Jersey has about as long a string of Sunday regulations as any State in the Union, but she is several lengths ahead of Georgia on the side of religious liberty. ELDER H. P. HoLsER, Superintendent of the Seventh-day Adventist missions in Europe, writes to the Review and Herald, the official paper of the denomination, that the police of Basel, Switzerland, are very diligent in keep-ing watch of the Seventh-day Adventist pub-lishing house in that city, to discover if work is being done on Sunday; but that they per-sistently close their eyes to other work going on in the immediate vicinity. For instance, on one Sunday they professed not to see a gang of workmen on the opposite side of the street from the publishing house, hammering  and sawing, building a grand stand  for a race to take place the same day. This' shows very clearly that in Switzerland, as in the United States, Adventists are not persecuted for Sun-day work, but for Sabbath rest. THE article, " Zealous in Details," on page 292, deserves more than passing notice. It is calm, dispassionate, and logical. Its manly, Christian tone is in sharp and striking con-trast with the intolerant bigotry of the para-graphs which the writer quotes in the outset of his article. r. ,Probably without refclizing it, the Advance admits the religious character of the Sunday statute of Tennessee in the words, " They [the Adventists] are taken sharply to task by the church and civil authorities." It is the same old story over again, the Church using the power of the State to enforce her dogmas. The charge that the Dayton (Graysville) Adventists " were planning for notoriety," is unreasonable. The Graysville Adventists hada. every reason to desire to be perniitted 'to qui-etly attend to their own affairs. They selected the village of Graysville for the establishment of a school largely because it was a quiet place, where they supposed they would be un-molested; and now to charge them with court-ing persecution is the height of folly as well as the depth of wickedness. A little more attention to " details" in the matter of obey-ing the ninth commandment would be an ex-cellent thing for those who are so ready to speak against the Adventists. EITHER religious liberty is a natural right of all men, or it is not the right of any 'man, for, " all men are created equal." Religions liberty being the natural right of every man, it can have only natural limita-tions. The only natural limitation to natural right is the equal rights of others. "Every man," says Macaulay, " has af,right,  to all that may conduce to his pleasure) if he' does not inflict pain upon anyone else. This is one of the broadest maxims of human nature, and I cannot therefore see how its supporters can be fairly called upon to defend itŠthe burden of proof lies, not on the advocates of freedom, but on the advocates of restraint." The principle is that every man has a right, as far as his fellow-men are concerned, to do as he wills, provided that will does not lead him to trample upon the equal rights of his fellows. This principle has been qseen and recognized by the defenders of religious liberty everywhere. The constitution of Maryland provides thatŠ No person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or prOfession, or for his religious practice, unless under color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, . . . or injure others in their natural, civil, or religious rights. It will be noticed that in this the line is drawn at the rights of others. Up to that point no man has any right to question the right of his fellow-man to do as he wills. This principle, while admitted theoretically  in Maryland, as elsewhere, Alas in almost every State of the American Union, been vio-lated in practice. In practice men are not permitted to do even in obedience to con-science everything which does not trench upon the equal rights of their fellow-men. For instance, in Maryland and other States, men are not permitted to exercise their natural right to labor when they choose, but are for-bidden to do secular labor or business upon the first day of the week; and this whether it in any way interferes with the equal rights of others or not. It is not sufficient to answer that by such work they cause mental pain to their fellow-men, because others by Sabbath work cause pain to those who observe that day; and rights being equal and to be equally protected, if to be preserved from mental pain were a natural right, then there should also be a law forbid-ding work upon the seventh day. But no-body would contend for anything of that kind for a moment. Government cannot under-take to protect the feelings of the people. Government can protect only the reputation, the person and the goods of those who are under its jurisdiction. It cannot undertake ,to shield from the annoyance of their own bigotry and intolerance, those who imagine that others should do as they do., and believe as they believe. WE have received from the publishers, the International Tract Society, Battle Creek, Mich., a copy of a very neat and well bound book, entitled, " Political Speeches and De-bates of Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglass." The occasion of the publication of these speeches is the attack now made upon the clause in the Declaration of Independence which declares that " governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." The parallel between this and the attack which was made prior to the Rebellion, upon the clause which declares that "all men are created equal," is very striking; and many of the arguments upon both sides are strik-ingly similar to the arguments which are used now on opposite sides of the question of the rights of the people.

IT is important that crime should be pun-ished, but far more important that the rights of the individual should be held inviolable, for that alone is all that stands between him and tyranny, whether executive or judicial.ŠJudge Gaynor.
