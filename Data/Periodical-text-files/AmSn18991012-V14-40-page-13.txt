Shall We Slag : 4 : Ł AMERICAN SENTINEL. 637 :- DANIEL WEBSTER, for Congress, sent a message of sympathy to the struggling Greek. We sent messages to.struggling Cuba, but we are now debarred from send-ing messages of sympathy to people struggling for free-dom. Suppose we sent our sympathy to the Boers? In an hour England would send back, "What about the Filipinos?"ŠTV. J. Bryan. THE real object of England, whether accomplished now or later, is to secure absolute control over all South Africa, and just as soon as the war begins this will be argued for by those in favor of the war, who will claim that half measures will onlyprolong unrest and produce more disturbances. Already Sir Walter Peace, Agent General in London for Natal, is talking for that kind of war, declaring that the war to accomplish this would not last more than two months; that to make pacifica-tion effective Great Britain must assume absolute con-trol over the whole of South Africa. He rejoices that the Orange Free State has taken a hostile attitude, for that means her addition to British possessions; the Free State would always have been a disturbing factor in the quiet of South Africa. The same sort of logic is always resorted to when a great nation wishes to engorge a small one. If one reads old Roman history and changes the dates and names, he will read in substance the history of every great conquering nation that has risen, grown rich, luxurious, arrogant, and been broken up or disinte-grated.ŠN.
