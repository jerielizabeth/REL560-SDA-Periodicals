AMERICAN SENTINEL. 53' Proposed Stringent Sunday Law for Ontario. BY M. C. GUILD. THERE is no small stir in this city and Province at present over a proposed amendment to the "Lord's Day Act," which has been introduced into the Ontario Parlia-ment, and has now passed its second reading. It is well understoo'cl that the amendment was intro-duced at the request of the "Lord's Day Alliance," to-gether with several ministers from various churches. The Alliance, an organization, similar to the "American Sab-bath Union," is making great efforts to secure this amendment, which will make the act much more binding than at present. They secured the services of Dr. W. F. Crafts, who has delivered lectures in various cities in the Province during the past week with the avowed object of securing the proposed legislation. It is getting to be recognized that Sunday is on the decline in Canada, and great efforts are being made to bolster it up, not the least of which is an appeal to civil law. Heretofore, it has been supposed that the present "Lord's Day Act" was stringent enough to suit the most fastidious Sunday-law inquisitor. It will be remembered that not long ago two Seventh-day Adventist ministers served time in jail,Šone for mix-ing mortar, and the other for carrying a pail of water, on Sunday,Šafter having conscientiously observed the seventh day as the Sabbath. However, in recent test cases against certain corpo-rations for Sunday labor, carried through by the "Lord's Day Alliance," it was held by the courts that the present law does not apply to corporations. Having been beaten in the courts, they now apply to the government for a law that will enable them to proceed against those who differ from them in practice and opinion. Part of the proposed amendment is as follows:Š "Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, en-acts as follows:Š "1. Section 1 of the Act to prevent the profanation of the Lord's day is amended by, striking out the words `merchant, tradesman, farmer, artificer, mechanic, work-man, laborer or other,' in the first and second lines thereof, and by adding thereto the following subsec-tions:Š "(The section as amended will read as follows: 'It is not lawful for any person whatsoever on the Lord's day to sell. or publicly show forth or expose or offer for sale or to purchase, any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate whatsoever, or to do or ex_ ercise any worldly labor, business or work of his ordi-nary calling' [conveying travelers or Her Majesty's mail, by land or by water, selling drugs and medicines, and other works of necessity and works of charity only excepted].) "The word 'persons' in this act shall be construed as including corporations, except where the context indi-cates a contrary intention, and any corporation which  requires or permits its employes to carry on the business-of such corporation, or to labor or work therefor con-trary to the provisions of this act, shall, for each offense, forfeit'and -pay a sum not exceeding $400. "Nothing herein contained shall relieve employes or 'servants of corporations who violate the provisions of this act from the penalties hereby imposed in case of vio-lation." It will readily he seen that this would stop all Sunday cars, freight trains, steamboats, cooks, and, in fact, nearly every occupation would be affected by it if con-strued literally. Not the least objectionable feature of this act is that the informer will get half the fine, thus putting a premium on interference with other men's lib-erties. The stringent nature of this amendment has called forth indignant protests from Sunday-keepers them-selves. The Hamilton Herald says:Š "This is the nearest approach to the old Blue Laws of New England that has been introduced in the Ontario Legislature." The Toronto Telegram saŁys:Š "The act is the outcome of either ignorance or of the bigoted cunning which begets tyranny. Considered as a piece of proposed legislation, the promoters have evi-dently thought the members of the House are sadly lack-ing in common sense or are extremely callous to the rights of the public. . . . There is apparently an en-tire want of consideration on the part of the Alliance for the rights of the great majority. The government will do well to reconsider this proposed bill. It has the name of the attorney-general endorsed on thp back as the pro-moter. It is to be hoped that this is merely formal, and that Mr. Hardy is not committed, on the eve of an elec-tion, or, indeed, at any other time, to the illiberal views and despotic interference of a so-called religious alliance, parading the fads of a few people under the guise of mo-rality." The Toronto World says:Š "It is to be feared that the attempts to coerce people by legislative enactments into obeying the fourth com-mandment must result in indefinite confusion, discontent, disgust, and resentment. There should be one rest day in the'week, and that rest day should be guaranteed to every worker who wants it, so far as it is in the power of the law to guarantee it. But for the law to go further than that, and compel a man to remain idle on Sunday when he would rather work, is an unwarrantable inter-ference with personal liberty. Instead of making the Sunday observance laws more stringent, they should be relaxed." January 11, a large and influential delegation waited on the government in opposition to the proposed amend-ment. A number of speakers were present, and many of them spoke strongly in favor of personal and religious liberty. A wholesome fear was expressed of the workings of the "Lord's Day Alliance." The government was.  urged to lay the bill over until the next session, that there might be opportunity to cir-culate petitions against it.
