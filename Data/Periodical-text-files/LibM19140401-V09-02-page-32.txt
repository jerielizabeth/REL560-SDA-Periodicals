78  LIBERTY THE MODERN SCOURGE OF THE MODERN PILATE. CONSCIENCE IS TIED TO THE STAKE - TRUTH AND EQUITY MUST BE CRUCIFIED are earnestly and always interested. Without those noble and precious liber-ties life is not worth the living. And we most assuredly believe that the Seventh-day Adventists are right in contending for those liberties, and heartily do we wish them courage in their good fight. We commend the principles here laid down to the candid consideration of Judge Elliott, of Baltimore. Our government should protect and de-fend the free exercise of every religion that is wholesome to civilization, and should never molest the liberty and reli-gious belief of a single individual who conducts himself as a good citizen. We affirm that the consciences of the minor-ity are just as sacred as those of the majority, and should be equally protected.
