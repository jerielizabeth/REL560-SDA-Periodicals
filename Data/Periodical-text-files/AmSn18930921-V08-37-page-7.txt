Your "Health Foods " are the wonder of the nineteenth century. I have used Granola but a short time, but have already experienced relief from indigestion and acid, or flatulent dyspepsia.. I also find the Zwiebach nourishing and toothsome. D. M. KAUFFMAN. I have personally tested your excellent food known as Granola. It is highly pleasing to the taste, easy of digestion, and the most nutritive cereal production with which I am acquainted. DR. R. W. BULA. NEW YORK. Your Granola is the best selling invalid food I have ever handled. I have already sold nearly two thousand pounds. A. J. BROUGHTON. CONNECTICUT. We have used your "Health Foods" in our family for three years, and can not get along without them. Having been troubled with dyspepsia and chronic inflammation of the stomach, I find that your Granola, Avenola, Wheatena, and Gluten are the only foods that I can eat with safety. WM. M. 1VIEnwfx. OHIO. Our baby is a testimonial to Sanitarium food. She is ten months old, weighs twenty eight pounds, and is as ruddy and healthy a specimen as can be seen. She has actually gained flesh while cutting her last two teeth. Her flesh is firm and sound, and she is very strong. FRED. L. ROSEMOND. MINNESOTA. We have twins, and the little fellows are thriving nicely. The food agrees with them perfectly, and I have recommended it to many who are bringing up babies "by hand." D. W. MoCounr.

Automatic machinery does everything in this watcn, and every part is as true as a die can make it.

Forte Wayne, Ind. R. H. Ingersoll & Bro., Room 44, 65 Cortlandt St., Now YorkŠKind Sirs: It is a standing rule of mine when I see an admirable trait in any character, or a marked excellence in anything, to express appreciation either in public or in private. Taffy is better than epitaffy. Post-mortem praises do the dead no good. The corpse smells no flowers on its casket. Hence I want to say that I am delighted with your WatchŠa little gem. I keep it on my typewriter desk during week-days, right before my eyes, and it keeps splendid time;.  I then use it on my pulpit Lord's days. Faithfully yours, REV. STEPHEN A. NORTHROP. R. H.
