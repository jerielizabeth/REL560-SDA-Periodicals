EDITORIAL NOTE AND COMMENT 453 But in general the world does not seem to be able to get much beyond the doctrine of John Cotton and others of whom he was a type, that "it is wicked for falsehood to persecute truth, but it is the sacred duty of truth to persecute falsehood." The world in general has changed from the position held by those who two centuries ago laid down this doctrine, in that it is no longer so sure as they were as to just what is truth and what is falsehood. But, in harmony with what Mr. Bryce says, it is by no means certain that if there were the unanimity and certainty to-day as to what is truth and what is falsehood that there was then, there would not be the same conviction..hat it is the duty of truth to persecute falsehood and the same readi-ness to see that truth did its duty. It is too bad that such is the case; but such is human nature. And because such is the case it is by no means as cer-tain as many people are disposed to be-lieve, that there will never again be a re-vival of persecution and proscription for opinion's sake in what are termed the civilized and enlightened nations. A time of uncertainty and indifference like the present may be the very transition period from a time of liberty and free-dom of opinion to a time of restriction and proscription. It enables divided and separated bodies to come together and to unite, and thus may be the means of changing a condition of affairs in which persecution is practically impossible into a condition of affairs in which it would be not only possible but very probable. The Nature of Sun- As an exhibit of the day Enforcement position and motives Made Plain in the matter of the class from which the demand for Sun-day enforcement chiefly comes the pro-nouncements given herewith are worth presenting entire. The first is a series of resolutions on " Sabbath observance "  adopted by the Dayton (Ohio) Minis-terial Association on June i. In both the words in italics are made so by us : Whereas, history shows that the greatest use-fulness and the highest happiness of the indi-vidual, the family and the state, as well as the best type of civilization, are found where God's law gives character to human codes; and, Whereas, the keeping of one day in seven is as binding as any other law of the Decalogue, having lost none of its importance since God " hallowed it " or issued the command to " remember " it, or since Christ sanctioned it; and, Whereas, the history of the race in all ages attests the truths of Christ's assertion that the Sabbath was made for man, and hence in man's nature is found the necessity that further estab-lishes the wisdom of the law ; and Whereas, we believe that the Christian Sab-bath, more than any other institution, tends to perpetuate the worship of the true God, and hence to clothe all law with authority, and is thus one of the chief cornerstones of our civil and religious liberties, since all human law worthy the name has been formulated from the Divine law; therefore, Resolved, that we deplore the growing and alarming disposition among the masses to make the Sabbath day not only one of so-called phys-ical recreation, but in fact of physical, mental and spiritual degradation. Resolved (2), that we call upon the members of our churches, Sunday schools and congre-gations and upon all others who, from what-ever motive, cherish the highest interests of society, to unite in an honest and persevering endeavor to maintain the sanctity of that day, the proper observance of which, experience proves, is one of the greatest conservators of peace and prosperity. Resolved (3), that we respectfully call the attention of the mayor, the board of public safety, the judges of our courts, justices of the peace, the prosecuting attorney, the county con-stabulary and the municipal police to the flagrant violations of the law, which permits only work of charity and necessity and pro-hibits with severe punishment such an abuse of the day as destroys the peace of society and infringes upon the rights of the worshipers; and that we pledge our moral support to the authorities in the enforcement of any and all Sunday laws. Resolved (4), that a copy of this action be
