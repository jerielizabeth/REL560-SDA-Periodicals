Is it not extraordinary that in the twentieth centui;i out on the free prairies, I should have to argue against a theological basis for legislation? Centuries of hatreds and fightings ought to have settled that question ages ago, and yet here it is again. Is mere theological opinion to be embodied in statutes, and to be forced upon people? . . . I say nothing against theology; but I do say that it has its place in the heart and intellect of the individual, and that no man, be he peasant, or priest, or king, and no combination of individuals. be  they a church, or a sect, or a parliament, has the right to dictate to me. or to any other person, what mŁy or his theology shall be in the very smallest particular, or to limit or embarrass my freedom of action because my theology is not the same as his or theirs. In other words, I am not justified in legislating for other people upon grounds drawn from my theological belief, any more than they are justified in seeking to legis-late for me upon the basis of their beliefs. And thus I demonstrate that Sabbatarian legislation in Manitoba cannot be defended upon theological grounds. This pres-ent-day claim of theology to control and dictate legislation is the undoubted relic and remainder of the baneful alliance that formerly existed everywhere between church and state. ŠJOHN S.
