120 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. NEW YORK, APRIL 10, 1890. Nopz.Š Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invari-able rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office. WE will in our next number give our readers some account of the late National Reform Convention in Washington City. Ł Ł  Ł  ROMANISM is said to be making consider-able headway in Japan, being favored by the emperor because of "its important in-fluence on the civilization of the nation over which he rules." --4.  THE, Rome correspondent of the Catho-lic Review states that South America is soon to have a Plenary Council of all its Catholic prelates. This simply means that Rome, warned by recent events in Brazil, is about to tighten her grip upon the entire continent. - Ł Ł  IT seems that strict Sunday observance under stress of civil law is not the sum of all virtues, nor even a virtue at all ; for in Scotland, the country in which they have the strictest Sunday laws, the most rigidly enforced, illegitimacy is greater than in any other civilized country. This shows that something more than civil law is required to make people moral. IT is announced by Mr. Crafts in the Christian Statesman of March 20, that :Š The fight against the mighty evils in this country seems to many of us an unfinished Waterloo. Rein-forcements from the religious press must come, or "night." It is to be hoped that that which comes to this fight of the American Sabbath Union, may be " night," and everlasting night at that. - Ł Ł  THE Union Signal speaks of President Harrison as "the ruler of forty-four States." He is no such thing. He is the servant of the people of forty-four States. The peo-ple are the rulers here, and no counte-nance should ever be given to those people who, imbued with foreign ideas, want to teach that those are rulers, who are only chosen to execute the will of the people. This is sound American doctrine. . 1. THE National Reform position is that Christ is the ruler of nations and that the moral law is the law of nations. But as nations are ruled by men, it follows that men must exercise authority in the name of Christ and interpret and administer the divine law. And as that law is spiritual, it follows that of necessity men must rule  in spiritual things. And that is putting men in the place of God, which is the essential principle of the Papacy. Hence the principle of National Reform is identi-cal with that of the Papacy. Ł AN attorney-at-law in Grand Rapids, Michigan, says :Š "Some friend of mine is sending me the SENTINEL, and I wish to thank him for it. You are laboring in the right direction, for it is all nonsense, this trying to compel people to observe Sunday as a rest-day. Have not we, as a Nation, outgrown such nonsense ? Do not the laboring people know when they are tired and need rest, without the appointment of the Nation as a guardian to tell them when they should rest ?" IN the Methodist ministers' meeting in Chicago, on the 31st ult., there was a lively discussion on the question of " The Atti-tude of Rome toward Our System of Edu-cation." Rev. D. R. Shepard, professor of political economy in the Northwestern University, attacked the parochial-school system and said that it appeared to be the design of the Catholic Church to incor-porate into the very systems of the chil-dren its dogmas and beliefs. He de-nounced the Romish system of education as " mediaeval, inadequate, and weak." He thought, however, that there was little danger from the fact that the American Catholics are not in hearty sympathy with their own system. Rev. Mr. Foster took a different view of the matter and asked: " Does the gentleman mean to say that there is no danger when we see $12,000,000 poured into the coffers of the Roman hierarchy in the city of New York alone, to carry on the work and the policy of that church? " He thought the danger a grave one. Dr. W. C. Bennett, professor of the Methodist Institute at Evanston, Indiana, defended the Catholic Church and de-clared that it did not differ so much from the Methodist Church. He said The Catholic Church has been criticised for having a supreme head, but the Methodist Church and every other church which is not bound to disintegrate, must have a supreme authority, as well as the Catholic Church, and it is nonsense to deny it. The only difference between our church and the Catholic Church on that head is, that the Catholic clergy keep their pledges of obedience to their supreme head better than ours do. There are some things, brethren, from which we might derive useful lessons, in the Catholic Church. And this is the attitude of very many Protestants. They are learning of Rome. There is danger in Romanism in this country, but it is more in the fact that Protestants are adopting Romish methods than in the aggressions of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Rome has ever appealed to the civil power for the help which she should have sought from the great Head of the Church, and the tide is setting very strongly in- the same di-rection among American Protestants. THE Pennsylvania Miners' Journal has the following excellent item:Š The man who believes in the thorough separation of Church and State, cannot approve of reading the Bible in the public schools. The public schools are essentially a part of the State institution. The Bible is even more a part of our religious structure. These facts render the two incompatible under the spirit of our Constitution, and make it possible for-even our most sincere Christians to consider all re-ligious exercises in school, out of place. Religion should be taught in the Church and at home, riot in the schools. Our Constitution guarantees freedom of religious faith to all, and we hope the day will never come when that guarantee is nullified even in the slightest degree. It is not alone the fact that the giving of religious instruction by the State is incom-patible with our institutions that should cause Christians to consider it " out of place." Every Christian should oppose even the slightest State interference in things religious because such interference is an infringement of the rights of con-science. The moment we concede the right of the State to require the reading of -the Scriptures in the public schools, we admit its right to introduce any other re-ligious instruction which the majority may wish to impose upon the minority.

In introducing to the public this new journal its publishers say We offer you something new in the history of the world. Temperance papers of every style are hap-pily numerous, and many of the highest ability. But never yet has one appeared devoted directly to the great work of temperance education, which more than all else holds the future. The temperance cause has reached a point where systematic study of its vast and rich literature is imperatively demanded. We propose a course of study which shall do for temperance what the Chautauqua course has done for literature and sci-ence. This plan is not partisan nor political, but simply an attempt to form an intelligent, public sentiment on the subject, on the importance of which all friends of temperance are absolutely agreed. We are most happy that a paper of this kind has been started. Such a publication is much needed, and if properly conducted ought to command a good support. We wish The Better Day success in its educa-tional temperance work. And we trust that it will succeed in avoiding the fate of all other so-called temperance papers, namely, that of becoming the mere ad-junct of a political party, or the organ of Ł an association or society.
