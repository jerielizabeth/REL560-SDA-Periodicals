This book treats upon the themes of Bible historyŠthemes not in themselves new, but so presented here as to give them a new significance. Beginning with the re-bellion in heaven, the author shows why sin was permitted, why Satan was not destroyed, and why man was tested, gives a thrill-ing description of man's temptation and fall, and rehearses the plan of redemption devised for his salvation. The life of each of the patriarchs, from Adam to King David is carefully scanned, and from each a lesson is drawn.
