Notice how, as shown by these figures, the Catholic Church outstripped all the Protestant sects in the race for Government patronage. The Catholic Church has had centuries of experience in this line, and can more than hold its own against all the Protestant bodies together in a contest for political supremacy. This should be a lesson to those Protestant organizations which are working to have the Government recognize religion. "After 1894, Congress, under the pressure of numer-ous protests from the people, began to call a halt on these appropriations. The amount was reduced, first to eighty per cent., and then to fifty percent., of the previ-ous appropriation. At the time of making the last re-duction, the policy of the Government was distinctly announced as being against any further appropriations of the kind." The Catholic Church has not relinquished the strug-gle, however, aswas shown by Cardinal Gibbons' petition to the last Congress to reconsider the whole subject of appropriations for Indian schools, SUCH is the anxiety of Spain to secure the release of the Spanish prisoners held captives in the Philippines,  that notwithstanding the prohibition of the American commander at Manila, General Otis, the Spanish govern-ment has offered Aguinaldo, the insurgent leader, 5,000 pesetas for the release of each Spanish officer, and 2,500 pesetas for each Spanish civilian, and 500 pesetas for each Spanish soldier held captive by the forces under his command. Sons of Old FreedomŠHark! BY FRANCES E. BOLTON. Sons of old Freedom can it truly be Ye hesitate to set another free? Have ye forgotten so the tyrant's pain That for a brother you can forge a chain? Will ye now bind the captive's pleading hands And set a despot o'er his conquered lands? You! sons of freedom! in the nations' sight Will ye repudiate your stand for right? And set the world agape in scoff and scorn And miss the destiny for which you're born? For as ye're made a world-wide light, and so Weakened the despot, turned the tide of woe, Yet if ye turn again to hold in thrall So shall your influence sway the law of all, And selfish despots from your acts again Will dare enslave the hands and souls of men. Sons of old Freedom, are not all men equal Endowed by their Creator? Mark the sequel That follows bondage. Will ye dare the wrath That falls upon the tyrant's blood stained path? Can ye be reckless still to bear the weight Of what your action means to all men's fate? For when-the nations groan to God, behold His ear will hear them as in days of old, And ye who forged the chain for men, will be Bound by his law's unalterable decree. Ye, who've known bonds and freedom, will ye bind The helpless captive, and still say;" 'Us kind"? A watching Heaven weighs your action in The heavenly balances, and notes your sin. Fill up the measure, mark the column's sum, And then the unremitting wrath will come; For heaven will flash its lightning through your gloom, And lo, the pit ye digged, will be your doom. Sons of old Freedom, weigh the words again, And give the scepter where ye've bound the chain. So shall all nations in humility Honor your Christ Lord, and set all men free. So shall the heavenly world with one vast voice Strike on their harps of gold, and cry, "Rejoice!" The Revival of Puritanism. "HISTORY repeats itself;" not by accident, but be-cause human nature is the same in all ages. Human nature is the fallen nature. It is passionate, vindictive, superstitious. Out of the passions of human nature have arisen the persecutions which have stained the pages of history. Persecution is less seen to-day not because human nature has changed, not because men hate each other less than formerly, but because the times have changed, and the methods which bigotry was once free to employ are no longer sanctioned. But history will repeat itself in persecution, as in other things. "The spirit of the times may alter, will
