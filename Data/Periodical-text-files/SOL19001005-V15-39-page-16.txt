This is a Very proper legal provision, but the judge in giving his decision declared that a person's religion is subordinate to the ldws of the land, citing as evidence a decision of the United States Supreme Court against Mormonism. This judge's decision is a precedent which will probably be heard from later. .—4 THE Michigan Christian Advocate, in giving some advice to " the voting Methodist," cites this para-graph from the chapter on temperance in the Metho-dist discipline: " We record our deliberate judg-ment that no political party has a right to expect, nor ought it to receive, the support of Christian men so long as it stands committed to the license policy or refuses to put itself on record in an attitude of open hostility to the saloon. But the foregoing must not be considered as in the interest of any political party." "The voting Methodist," adds the Advocate," has as a guide the deliberate judgment' of the repre-sentative men of his church that no political party which is tolerant toward the saloon is entitled to a Methodist vote." Without casting any reflection upon the sincerity of the assertion that this is not meant to favor any political party, the fact remains that no one will have any difficulty in knowing which one of the par-ties the voting Methodist must sustain if this ad-vice is followed. But if the saloon evil ought to be cast out by vote, why should not other national evils be attacked in the same way, and why should not the representative men of the church record their "deliberate judgment" concerning these also? .4 .4 REPEATED outbreaks of religious intolerance in Mansfield, Ohio, have recently occurred, following various attempts of certain elders of the Dowie " Zion '2  church to hold religious services with the few followers of the sect residing in that place. The conduct of the city government in permitting these repeated outrages is rightly characterized by leading American journals as pusillanimous in the extreme and entirely without excuse. "What," in-quires the Independent," can Ohio say about South-ern lynchings when Mansfield thus flouts the laws and the constitution of the State and the country?" and the question is altogether pertinent. .4 .0 COUNT TOLSTOY, the famous Russian, has been excommunicated by the Russian state church (Greek Catholic), which has undertaken further to see that the Count does not get into heaven, by for-bidding him " absolution "in the hour of death. In view of the fact that Tolstoy does not believe in war, and is opposed to every principle of tyranny, and does not hesitate to say so, this attitude of the Greek Catholic Church is readily comprehensible. THE following "special cable" from Paris to the New York Tribune gives " the latest " on the Chinese situation: " PARIS, September 29.ŠA veneer of purely for-mal and conventional cermonial is all that is left of the famous European concert in China. The politely-worded official disclaimers from St. Petersburg of any ,desire for territorial acquisition are accepted here as at Berlin and London with the same ex-quisite courtesy with which they are proffered. The mask has fallen, and in diplomatic circles not a doubt is entertai,ned but what Germany's vigorous initiative, keenly backed by Japan, marks the first step towards the dismemberment of the Chinese empire."
