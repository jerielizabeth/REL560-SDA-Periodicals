This pamphlet contains the arguments in behalf of the rights of American citizens, and in oppositon to the Blair Sunday-rest bill, which Mr. Jones presented before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, Dec. 13, 1888. Mr. Wilbur F. Crafts has pronounced the report as published - "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING-, And Mr. Jones's comments will make It more so. His argument is enlarged -to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruption, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accom-panied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. As the Sunday question is now a living issue,. this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially legislators, lawyers, judges, -and other public men.

REthcaous questions are not ordinarily proper subjects of po-litical criticism and discussion, but ,when embodied in bills and resolutions and introduced into, Congress they become political issues that must be met, dis-cussed and decided upon their po-litical merits. Such measures as the "Sun-day Rest Bill," and "Religious Amendment," introduced by Sen-ator Blair in the 50th Congress, and recently re-introduced by him in the present session, drag these religious - questions from the do-_ main, of theological discussion; where they belong,- and thrust them Into the arena of politiCs, Where they must be subjected to the criticism, discussion and set-tlement of political questions, These issues are forced upon the people ,of the United States by a direct- attack upon the tunda-: mental principles of free govern-ment. Our COnstitution recog-nizes the absolute equality of all its citizens ;. ,equality, not in physical development, mental acumen, nor social standing, but in their right's; Our Government as the conservator of the rights of all its citizens, guarantees to its humblest citizen, and to the weakest minority, all the rights accorded to its most prominent citizens and largest majorities. No partiality is admissible. Wealth, imnabers; physical per-fection and social prominence are alike -denied standing room upon the scales of justice, and absolute equality, of rights is Made the bed-rOck of all our free institu-tions,  In recognition of the inherent and indefeasible right of 'every citizen to be protected in the dependent  exercise and free ex-pression of his religious con-victions, "our Constitution wisely withholds from Congress the power to legislate upon religious subjects, and only -restrains -the liberty -of the individual when he seeks to invade the rights of oth-ers. The success of the Blair measures: involves the subversion of these principles and the re-moval of the constitutional bar-rier that ,now protects the weak from oppression by the strong. The full text of these proposed measures should be published broadcast and all the avenues of intelligent expression opened wide for their full and, free discussion, — A Blanchard, Polk Clountir 0449.0 Jutorma; THE BEST DUPLICATINC INKS FOR USE WITII gYCLOSTYLE," MINEOGRAPH,"- - " COPrGRAPH."
