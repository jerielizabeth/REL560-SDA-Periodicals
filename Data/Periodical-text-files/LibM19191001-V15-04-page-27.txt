And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God." 2 Sam. 6: 3-7. 1 1111110111101111111111111111111111111111111111MIilmilliiimilliifilMIDID11111111111111111  111111111111111111111111811111111111111111111111I111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
