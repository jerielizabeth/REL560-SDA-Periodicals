AMERICAN SENTINEL. 559 Studies in French History.-37. "KING LOUIS XII. was certainly the best ruler France had seen in a long, long time, and I have no doubt," said Professor Carman, "that the kind-hearted and amiable Queen Anne had a great part to act in keeping the kingdom in so prosperous and well governed a con-dition, as it was, in comparison with what it had been under most of the former kings. "But death is an impartial visitor, and after a while he called upon Anne of Brittany, and the good queen died." "I suppose I am quite a dunce, professor," said Bert Mathews, but I wish you would tell us something about Brittany." "I ought to have done so before, Bert. It is that part of France which you might term 'the great north-western peninsular.' It is quite extensive, as you will see by the map, and covers over 13,000 square miles. The original name was Armorica, but British colonists came here in great numbers,. and so changed the name to Brittany, some time in the fifth century. "You will remember that some time ago we learned that Charles VIII. conquered this duchy and married the young Duchess Anne, whom Louis XII. also married. Now that she was dead, the king now past middle life, and certainly old enough to know better, took to him-self a young bride only twenty years old. This was the sister of the king of England, Henry the Eighth." " Why, I thought King Henry and Louis were not very warm friends," said Harry Ray. "They had not been; but they both decided that it would be for their mutual interest to take this step, and so, although the poor young princess had given her heart to the duke of Suffolk, she was not consulted, and the two great kings had their way." "Did she make a good queen, I wonder," chimed in Milly Brown. " She hardly had a fair trial, for King Louis died in about three months. This sad event was without doubt hastened by his sudden change of habits. The young queen liked to keep late hours, and Louis was not used to this,Šstrange as it may seem to us now, he was used to going to bed at six o'clock. Of course, he liked to please his young wife, so he began to attend all sorts of fegtivities, and to sit up until midnight. He also changed his custom of dining, taking his dinner at noon. instead  of much earlier, as this was getting to be the fashion. "It seems that Louis could not have been very rug-ged at that time, for these changes were more than he could bear. He died in. 1515, at the age of fifty-three years, more sincerely mourned by his people than any king of France since good St. Louis." "I suppose his son didn't make so good a king as his father," remarked Will Barnaby. "He did not leave any son at all, Will; so his son-in-law, Francis the First, being a descendant of the first duke of Orleans, took the vacant throne at the age of twenty." "I imagine King Louis feared for his country,Što leave it in the hands of a young fellow who knew nothing of a king's duties," said Julia March. "He did have fears; indeed he called the prospective king a 'big boy,' and said he was afraid he would spoil all that he had done to better the condition of France." Milly Brown never felt satisfied until she had some description of the personal appearance of the kings, and so it was she who asked:Š " Was King Francis a kingly looking man, pro-fessor ?" "I suppose," was the reply, "that he was the most magnificent looking man who had ascended the French throne in centuries. He is described as being a perfect specimen of physical beauty. This is well enough as far as it goes, and in this case it was united with great per-sonal courage." "I daresay the people felt sure he would be as good as he looked, and admired him just as the ancient Is-raelites admired King Saul. I hope they were not dis-appointed in him," said Julia. "I fear they were, Julia; the Lord does not see as man does; he looks upon the heart, and he estimated the young king by his character at once. And after a few years the people began to do so, too; for Francis was an extravagant fellow, who spent money as freely as water, and didn't care so very much whose money it was, either. He soon taught the people that his will, and his alone, was the only thing to be considered for, a moment." "It is a great mystery to me," said Joe Palmeter, " why the people endured so much oppression for so many centuries." " Well, all these abuses of the rights of the people are what finally led to the troubles which culminated in the horrible revolution of 1789. "About the first thing Francis did," continued the teacher, "was to start out with a large army against Italy. To cut a long story short, the French were suc-cessful. The king made a treaty of peace with the Swiss, who had been helping the Italians, and another treaty with the pope. The French people didn't like this popish interference at allŠ" " Neither should I suppose they would," interrupted Joe Palmeter. "It's so queer the popes must all have a hand in every governmental pie."
