The Sentinel OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY VOL. XVIII NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 17, 1903 NO. 38     "All things whatsoeber ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for such is the law and the prophets." The man Irho is not willing that the state should teach the religion of the other man, in lbhich he does not belie'be and which he regards as error, should not ask that the state teach his religion, which the other man does not believe and regards as error. One difficulty with the contention that "the schools of the nation ought to be Christian" because "this nation is a Christian nation," is that this nation is not a Christian na-tion. This nation is a secular nation; it wears the badge of no religion. The proposition of the Bible in the public schools inevi-tably in'botbes the question, Which Bible? This is a ques-tion which the state cannot decide without allying itself with a sect and assuming to decide what book, and what book only, contains the revealed will of God. From its own standpoint ebery religion is universal and all-comprehending; but from the standpoint which Dbern-ment must occupy ebety religion, no matter how great the number of its adherents, is a sect. Some one religion may be the true and all-comprehending religion, but government has no right to say what religion that is.   011111111≈ÅMla AmrssomrS     Religion and the Bible in the Public Schools PUBLISHED WEEKLY ONE DOLLAR A YEAR ID PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING CO., II West 20th St.,,New York City OAKLAND.
