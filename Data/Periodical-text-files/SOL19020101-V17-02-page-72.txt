The church is strenuously opposed to the liquor trafficÑon the first day of the week. She is opposed to the Sunday saloon, not because it gives additional power and advantage to the liquor traffic, but because legalized Sunday opening will deprive her institutionÑthe religious SundayÑof a portion of the legal prestige and advantage that it possesses. Her representatives declare: "If the principle which admits of the Sunday saloon is wrought out and extended, it would annihilate the whole legal observance of the Sabbath, and would justify EVERY AND ANY SECULAR USE OP THE SABBATH DAY." This touches the keynote of the church's atti-tude in the matter, and it is this attitude, which leads her representatives to declare: "The sale of liquor is just as legitimate as the sale of iron, or anything else, but the Lord's day must be maintained.  If you must drink on Sunday, buy your beer and whisky on Saturday, and drink it at home." The church, in her zeal for enforced religion, is losing her zeal for temperance; she is moving toward a position in which she will be the ally of the saloon. Contrast with this attitude of the church the position of an eminent prohibitionist: "If people are to be taught to drink and encouraged to continue drinking, it is a waste of time and gray matter to differentiate between Sunday and Monday. The present excitement in New York misses the gist of the subject. The liquor traffic is wrong morally, industrially and economically. n.  ¥-¥¥.¥ ..no  '1'1,1.  nnc; s;  nneitinn of  rnmnr fnr Ctimi v enfnrre¥man4 Ti,. ohn ,a ;11 tleirnf in', A.....
