Jones, is now ready for circulation. This pamphlet contains the arguments in behalf of the rights of American citizens, and in oppo-sition to the Blair Sunday-rest bill, which Mr. Jones presented before the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, Dcc. 13, 1888. Dr. Wilbur F. Crafts has pronounced the report as published "MIGHTY INTERESTING READING," And Mr. Jones's comments will make it more so. His argument is enlarged to what it would have been without Senator Blair's interruptions, objections, and counter-arguments, and is accompanied with answers to all of his objections and counter-arguments. The following specimen page from the book shows some of the questions and answers, and every page of the book is replete with sound arguments by Mr. Jones. 60 THE NATIONAL SUNDAY LAW. Senator Palmer, Š Do you suppose they intended there a practical theocracy ? Mr. ,ones. ŠI do, sir ; but let me read further, and you will get their own words. Senator Blair. Š If these women are trying to over-throw the institutions of the country, and are about to establish a sacerdotal State, we ought to know it. Mr. zones. Š That is true, and that is why I am speaking here ; we want the nation to know it. Senator Blair.ŠThese women need looking after, I admit. Mr. yones.Š They do in that respect, and there are many men concerned in the same business. Senator Blair. ŠOtherwise it would not be dan-gerous. Mr. zones. Š It would be dangerous anyway. A theocratical theory of government is dangerous any. where. It is antichristian, as well as contrary to right and the principles of justice. Senator Blair. Š Do you suppose that the govern-ment of heaven is a theocracy ? Mr. Jones.Š Yes, sir ; but a civil government Š a government of earthŠis not. Senator Blair. Š Then why is it dangerous ? Mr. yones.Š Governments of earth are not danger-ous when properly controlled. Senator Blair. Š They only say that a true theocracy is yet to come. A millennium is supposed to be com-ing ; perhaps they have reference to a millennium that we have not yet got, so that they will wait some years before they get it. Mr. zones. ŠBut I am going to read what kind of laws they propose to make to bring in the millennium. Senator BlainŠSo far as you have read, you have not touched the question ; for they say a true theocracy Page 6o, "National Sunday Law." As the Sunday question is now a living issue, this treatise will be interesting to all classes, especially legislators, lawyers, judges, and other public men. The argument is Based on Scripture and History, Constitution and Law, Showing the limits of the civil power, the unconstitutionality of the Sunday bill, an analysis of the Sunday laws and other religious legislation of the different States, the Sunday-law movement of the fourth century, the Sunday-law movement of the nineteenth century, the methods used in securing indorsements to the petition for the Blair bill, and the workings of such Sunday laws as are proposed for the United States. The work contains one hundred and ninety-two pages. Price, 25 cents. Address, AMERICAN SENTINEL, 1059 Castro St., Oakland, Cal.; 43 Bond St., New York.
