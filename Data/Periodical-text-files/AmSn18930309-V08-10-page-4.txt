      VoL. 8, No. 10.          closed Fair you set forth the intellect of the laboring men of the United States, you again misrepresent the facts. Then the plea is made that the opening of the Fair will necessitate extra work upon the part of the engineers. Let me tall your attention to this fact, that, if the World's Fair is closed on Sunday, people will be absolutely prohibited from enjoy-ing its privileges on that day. That day will be given to traveling. Men will start on Sunday, reach Chicago Sunday night or Monday, spend the week at the Fair, take the train at the latest hour Saturday night or the earliest Sunday morning. MR. DURBOROW.ŠMr. Morgan, you have been speaking just twenty-five min-utes, and have consumed the time allotted to you. I understand that you desire Mr. Askew to follow you, and unless you give away to him, of course you would occupy his time. MR. MORGAN.ŠOh, excuse me, Mr. Chairman; I did not think I had been talking so long. But really I would like to have a little more time. I have a paper here which I would like very much to present. MR. DTJRBOROW.ŠIf you have the con-sent of the other speakers of course it will be all right. DR. W. H. THOMAS.ŠI will give you my time. MR. DURBOROW.ŠSimply state a synop-sis of your paper if you can, and give it as quickly as possible. MR. MORGAN.ŠI will read it as rapidly as possible, and you can read it at your leisure. (Reading)ŠIn regard to the religious side of this matter, I wish to say that the workingmen attribute the action of Con-gress in closing the World's Fair on Sun-day to the activity and influence of the Protestant evangelical church, and that in the accomplishment of its purpose the representatives of these churches assume to be the guardians of the economical and moral interests of the working people and in their name and behalf urge Congress to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. We are duly authorized by the only organized and formal movement made by workingmen in relation to the closing of the Fair on Sunday to absolutely deny the right of these churches or their repre-sentatives to speak or act for us in this matter, and to prove to you by document-ary evidence we present that all such rep-resentations made to Congress by these churches are wilfully or ignorantly fraudulent. In this connection we desire to call the attention of congressmen who may have been influenced by the action of these churches, and who are sincerely interested in the religious side of this question, to the fact that the indifference or active antagonism of the working clasges to-ward the Church is at present, and has been for years past, a subject of the most serious consideration by the clergy. We respectfully represent that one of the principal causes of this latent and active hostility to the Church is due to the fact that its representatives are so far removed economically and socially from the wage working classes as to entirely fail to un-derstand their wants, desires, and aspira-tions, and hence as a result, when they do speak in our name they misrepresent us, as they have in this case. This has oc-curred so frequently and universally that the respect and reverence for the Church held by the working people in the past has been destroyed to such an extent that the Church itself has become alarmed. With a few exceptions, and upon rare occasions, a suggestion to have a clergy-man open or participate in our conven-tions or mass meetings would be met with contemptuous ridicule. Tens of thousands of wage-workers who, like myself, have passed from infancy to manhood within the folds of the Church, and in being forced from it have retained a fervid love for the moral principles taught by the car-penter of Nazareth, realize not only the wickedness embodied in the acts of the clergymen in shutting the workers out of the Fair but also understand the effect it will have in further alienating the work-ing classes from, and intensifying their hostility toward, the Church. Speaking as we do, with this intimate personal knowledge we respectfully, but most earnestly, urge congressmen who have been influenced by religious consid-erations to undo this ill-advised and in-jurious act of the Church. THE RESULT. As, therefore, Congress has committtd itself to Sunday legislation, and as this legislation will be opposed and denounced as wicked and only wicked, and as the very institution over which it has made its fatal plunge (the Sunday) will be shown by the press, as it has been shown in the past, to be a usurper and unchris-tian, such publications will be "deemed: injurious by Congress to the public mor-als." placed on the " _Index Expurgator-ius," and prohibited the use of the mails.. A censorship of the press will be estab-lished,with its necessary inquisition. Thus by this process of legal fiction of judge- made laws, the glorious First Amendment to our Constitution has been wiped out. Says Mr. Taylor :Š Sir Henry Maine in his great work on " Ancient Law," has told us that the most subtile and in e-sistible device ever employed by judges to change the effect of positive laws and constitutions, with-out changing their outward form, is what is known to lawyers as a "legal fiction." " The fact is that the law has been wholly changed; the fiction is that it remains what it always was." And so the First Amendment has been wholly changed save perhaps the clause guarding freedom of speech. But how long with that last ? Read Bishop Leigh-ton's article on " Limit6tion of Religious Discussion, " in the North American Review for January, in which he contends that to speak against the Christian religion or its ordinances should be considered treason. Such it will be considered when Congress has fully gathered itself into the toils. The men behind all these movements may be honest. It may seem necessary to them to establish a censorship of the mails instead of submitting alleged wrongs to "due process of law. Sunday to them may be a sacred institution, a Christian institution. It may seem blas-phemous and treasonable against God to speak against these things, and so treason-able and amenable to law in a Christian nation. The men engaged in all this may be sincere. So was Saul and so were the papists of the Dark Ages when they put to death " the whitest of the saints of God." So were the Jews who put to death the Perfect Man. And that man declared : "Yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me." John 16:2, 3. This is the secret. They know not the gospel of Christ, for to know the gospel is to know God and Christ. Though they know it not, the whole thing is uncharitable, unmanly, unchristian. Sunday is unchristian, therefore the un-christian methods to uphold it. God can care for his own government, and is able to punish all transgressors. He depu-tizes men not to execute his law, but to preach the gospel of peace. God pity them in their blindness. They know not what spirit they are of. WE KNEW IT WOULD COME. Yes, we knew it would come. We have known it and said it in various publica-tions for more than two score years. We did not know how it would come or just when it would come, but we knew that all this was coming soon, and we said so. We did not say so because we did not love our country; but we knew it and said it was coming because God's " more sure word of prophecy " said it was coming. We walked by faith then; we walk by Another Supreme Court Decision. THE next step will be the prohibition of the use of the mails for disseminating that literature which points out the iniquity and unchristianity of all Sunday laws, and the absolute falsity of Sunday itself as a Christian institution. It may be thought by the reader that this can never be, for the Constitution de-clares that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." But that guarantee of liberty is already swept away by another judge-made law, another Supreme Court decision, given on Feb. 1, 1892, which makes Congress as much a censor of the press as existed in the Middle Ages. The occasion of the decision was certain cases under the lottery law as amended Sept. 19, 1890. That decision declares that the First Amendment to the Constitution does not restrain Congress from excluding from the mail all documents " con-demned by its judgment;" that it may "refuse the facilities for the distri-bution of matter deemed injurious " " to public morals ;" that it "possesses the power to forbid the use of the mails in aid of the perpetration of crime or immorality." The court contends that this is not a blow at the liberty of the press; that papers may circulate in other ways than by mail ; or, in the words of the decision, " The circulation of newspapers is not prohib-ited, but the Government declines itself to become an agent in the circulation of printed matter which it regards as injur-ious to the people," But Congress has no power over any other means of distribu-tion than the mail; and it was the intent of the First Amendment to prohibit Con-gress from acting as a censor in the matter of what it was proper, so far as physical character was concerned, to dis-tribute through the mail. This decision means, if it means anything, that what-ever Congress may in its judgment con-demn "as injurious to the people," or " injurious " "to public morals," it will prohibit the use of the mails, whther the document be political or religious, private or public.* *For a fuller review of this decision the reader, is referred to an article entitled "A Blow at the Freedom of the Press," by Hannis Taylor, Esq., in North American Review for Decem-ber, or the admirable condensation of that article by the Weekly Review.
