FLOAT REPRESENTING TILE LEAGUE OF NATIONS FOR THE MAINTEN, I . F America were at this juncture to fail the world, what would come of it? I do not mean any disrespect to any other great people when I say that America is the hope of the world, and if she does not justify that hope the results are unthinkable. Men will be thrown back upon the bitt&ness of disappointment not only, but the bit-terness of despair. All nations will be set up as hostile camps again; the men at the Peace Confer-ence will go home with their heads upon their breasts, knowing that they have failed Š for they were bidden not to come home from there until they did something more than sign a treaty of peace."Š From President Wilson's speech at Bos-ton, Feb. f4, 1919. President Wilson is correct in saying that polit-ically " America is the hope of the world." Amer-ica is the synonym of liberty and all its attendant blessings. It was the first nation to give a political meaning to the divine proclamation for universal freedom: "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." America stands for world freedom. Nor can this nation consistently slacken its efforts to realize this ideal until " all the inhabitants of all the earth " are set free in civil and religious matters. As a peo-ple Americans regard " liberty as the greatest of all earthly blessings." 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111II11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111I11IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 11111111111111111111IMUM1111111111111111111HIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINIIUMIUMINIMUI1011101111MUUM 36 America the HI " Give me liberty, or give me death! " was the battle cry of our forefathers. By voice and pen and by the sacrifice of their lives upon the altar of freedom they redeemed America from the chains and shackles of Old World oppression and tyranny that had already fastened itself upon the New World. It was God's purpose that America should Łbe free. Wendell Phillips voiced American sentiment when he said: " The Carpathian Mountains may shelter tyrants. . . . For aught I know, the wave of Russian rule may sweep so far westward as to fill once more with miniature despots the robber castles of 'the Rhine. But of this I am sure: God piled the Rocky Mountains as the ramparts of freedom. He scooped the Valley of the Mississippi as the cradle of free States. He poured Niagara as the anthem of free men." America was the first nation to recognize the inalienable rights of the individual Š the great-est of which is the unmolested enjoyment of " life, 111111111111111111111111111111111I11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111S1 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111,11111111111111111111111111111111101111111111114111111111111HHMIUMUM By C.
