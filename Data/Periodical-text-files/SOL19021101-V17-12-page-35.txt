quent largesses, and gay spectacles to be had in the large towns. The small hold-ers went off to follow the eagles or swell the proletariate of the cities, and their holdings were left to run waste or merged in the vineyards, oliveyards, and above all in the great cattle farms, of thb rich, and their own places were taken by slaves." And in this way, together with governmental grants on very loose terms, of vast tracts of public lands, came into existence the celebrated LAND MONOP-OLY, which in the Roman Republic became such an evil as monopolies are be-coming in the United States to-day. "CIVIC EQUALITY AND SOLIDARITY WERE ALIKE DESTROYED BY THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN A FEW HANDS, the disap-pearance of the small independent freeholder, and the growing numbers of freed-men and clients. The Roman community became not only unmanageably large, but HOPELESSLY DIVIDED BY CLASS DISTINCTIONS AND INTER-ESTS. THE OLD TRADITIONS, BELIEFS, AND USAGES inseparably con-nected with the republican regime, and essential to its continuance, LOST GROUND DAILY before the incoming flood of new fashions, intellectual and social, from Greece and the East." "ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISTURBANCE AND DISTRESS" came on, "creating A GROWING FEELING OF DISCONTENT" and causing the advocacy of "SOCIALISTIC SCHEMES." 7:he great result of it all was the division of society into two great partiesŠ"THE PARTY OF PROP-ERTY AND A PARTY WHO DESIRED A CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY." Not that there were two parties so named and an issue so styled, but such was the great division in the state and the underlying issue in all the lesser issues over which the parties divided and struggled. And the farther things went the more evident did it become, for the more actual it became, that society was divided into these two parties. And in large outline the history of the Re-public from the time these two divisions appeared was a more and more desperate struggle for mastery in the state between these two parties, BOTH OF WHICH, AS THEIR INTERESTS SERVED, DISREGARDED THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS, and when necessary raised riots and accomplished their pur-poses by violence. REFORM BY LAW was attempted again and again, the popular party of course leading in such attempts, and making them its rallying cry. The great attempt which stands out above all others was that with which the names of the Gracchi are inseparably linkedŠthe attempt to abolish the land monopoly, and to redistribute the land to the people in small allotments. "It was a scheme which could quote in its favor ancient precedent as well as URGENT NECESSITY." "The senate from the first IDENTIFIED ITSELF WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE WEALTHY OCCUPIERS," CLAIMING TO STAND ON THE CON-STITUTION. But by the socialistic scheme of "the establishment of regular monthly doles of corn" for one class of voters, and by conciliating another with special privileges of getting revenues from a new province, the Gracchi were measurably successful in carrying through their reform. But "even in the life-time of Caius Gracchus the clause in his brother's law rendering the new holdings inalienable, was repealed, and THE PROCESS OF REABSORPTION RECOM-MENCED." But the matter gave rise to a desperate constitutional conflict be-tween the two parties, and, "though the agrarian reform failed, THE POLITICAL CONFLICT IT HAD PROVOKED ENDED ONLY WITH THE DICTATOR-SHIP OF CIESAR, and the lines on which it was waged were in the main those laid down by Caius Gracchus." The course of the two partiesŠthe party of the people and the party of wealth and privilegeŠinevitably brought on military dictatorship. They quarreled with in-creasing bitterness, and were controlled more and more by a spirit of violent parti-
