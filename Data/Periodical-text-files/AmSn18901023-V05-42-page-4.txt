  E = MEET-CAN -                          liOotiebience,',  Such laws, if‚made teapply equally to W'ould,  require`revery to shape his bteiiiess affairs to Snit the - 'religiotii,'ConVietiOns of every other man;  Whieh would be an inapessibility; If linfited to 'a certain class they =would be ntijnst, and would result- in religious in-Iblerance'and oppression.

Why should the Government see ,tliat 'he is shielded from pecuniary loss in If011oWing Out his religious convictions, and Other,  citizens who may observe soine.Otheir,day in compliance with their views?"`" If the _Governiaent %UrtalieS to protect one class in this way 'lapin-14We' ground, it is bOund, in dealing With all; to protect every other 'the same ,way upon the same grounds This, however, would be an un-dertaking implying, as we have seen, an ,utter impossibility in its adjustments. 'And'-such an undertaking is not contem-plated` by Mr. 'Crafts and his coadjutors. It 'is simply the observer of Sunday they proPese now- to relieve 'from Making a -choice between violating consCience; and losing dash. We wonder ;if ' they never *read the passage Speaks' " of the trial of your faith being much more pre-'cio'us than Of gold" ? It would seem that theydid net ;Wish any one's faith in Sun-. day:keeping tried: 'They would Want the 'keeper " carried to the skies on 41'6W:0f-beds of ease," and let others get as beet they can. Our opinion of any Sundity keeping that comes 'from such indribements; as this; is; that it will not ' 'Count ' ranch at the great.  tribunal 'abOVe f If 'this be true, Sunday laws are not only Superfinous in' this world, but "will iiieure no One a paesport to the world "to come, in which case Mr. Crafts might as well' go home and hang up his " Dam-asciis saw." '1,1i0'43.rifii3ef ',gelation Of' this question is, AO let every-man obSerVe whatever :;day his religious convictions dictate,' and whatever inconvenience or-  pecuniary loss thie'mafeause him is a sacrifice he makes to hie,  religion, and one which he should make and not another. For any one to , seek 'to evade this is for him to ask that anether bear the crosses of his religion, a thing Which no true Christian* will do. If a Man wishes to, observe Sunday, he must 'not' engage in. business or hire himself out to an employer requiring Stinday work. -And' every man is free not to do this. If the' GoVernment provides that one man must-net 'be refused work 'or be discharged beeanee 'he keeps Sunday, then, upon the groiind Of - equality, it must likewise pro- that no other man shall be refused work 'or discharged who keeps any other -.day But hoW many Sunday - keeping merchants, bankers, and business men, would submit to a law compelling them to retain any employes who might turn Mohammedan and keep' Friday; or soy; enth-day observer and keep.  Saturday? This shows the injustice of such a deniand. The man who wishes to keep Friday must not engage in business requiring Friday work; the man who chooses to keep Sat-day must not engage in business requiring Saturday work; and, likewise, _ the man who desires to keep Sunday must not en-gage in business requiring Sunday work. If he does, he alone is responsible for the use he makes of the day. Let this rule be carried out, and there will be no difficulty, no class legislation, no -injustice, and .no' one's rights infringed, in the matter. Re-ligious profession and practiCe will be free, and capital and labor will' stand ' upon an equal footing. W. A. COLCORD. May the State Rightfully Prohibit Polygamy?  THEitE are many people who oppose,  polygamy on what are commonly called moral grounds, but who are quite uncer-tain just hew to frame their objection so as to justify the Government in suppress-ing it. They are conscientiously opposed to it, and yet cannot' quite satisfy those same consciences that the State has an in-disputable right to prohibit the institution. In other words, they are assured that po-lygamy is morally wrong, but feel nnable to point out the exact basis on which the civil power may rightfully prev'ent or rectify this Wrong. As it,  was in the days of slavery, so is it in these latter days in respect to, the :general uncertainty of: opin-ion as to the right Of Government to cor-rect .aeknowledged and  widely-exterided evils. And as in those days the time came when .men ',were' obliged to:take positive stand, so the time now is when every intelligent man and woman should have clear-cut opinions upon this question. Some have already taken their position, and would seek to defend governmental interference With polygamy on the ground that the institution is disgraceful, and op-posed to the spirit of progress and civ-ilization. Others, more radical, would justify the State in prohibiting it on the specific ground that it is an absolute moral wrong. It may be freely granted that the objec-tions of both of these classes appear to be direCt and natural; but it is not so appar-ent that these objections are sufficiently.  strong in those characteristics which prop-erly give it jnrisdiction, to justify the Government in interfering with polygamy. The first objection is itself objectionable for the reason that it is too vague and irrelevant; the same theory would require the State to prohibit the use of tobacco on the ground that it also is a relapse into barbarism. There is no such thing as a spirit of progress of sufficient legal pro-portions to justify Government in inter-fering with what are held to be the private rights of conscience. The sooner men disabuse themselves of this idea, the fewer will be the evils arising from too Much government. The same objection, in general, appliqs to the position of the second class of ob-jectors to polygamy; though their argu-ment deserves a more specific refutation. That, a certain practice is absolutely wrong morally, is not an adequate reason why civil government should prohibit it. The prohibition must be made for other reasons, if the State maintains individual personal rights. Civil government can know no moral right or wrong; it takes cognizance of only civility and incivility, since it cannot look into the inner secret motives of an. individual. This view is strongly opposed by a large number of people who would be pleased to see the Government made Paternal Tendencies.  IT is astonishing, :to contemplate the , growing tendency toward paternalism in government -in our country during the last ten years. The demand is that the ,Government shall be everything and do everything. In a recent discourse before the Young Men's Christian Association, Rev. Thomas Dixon, appealed for the legal abolition of strikes. He would have the Government raise its hand against them, even to the expediency of bringing the railroads and their operations and . responsibilities, including the actions of their employes, under its indisputable power of management and restraint.. The public has the right to demand the cessation of strikes," Mr. Dixon thinks, and the simplest way would be for the Government to enforce this deniand by depriving the strikers of the freedom that now makes strikes possible. Commenting upon this, the Sun saysŠ This would be the tyranny of slothful despotism-There is nothing that a despot hates so much as disturbances of any sort, except those of his own making, and force is his means of preventing or.'  suppressing them. If there is a principle estab-lished  in great manufacturing countries, it is the right of men to organize labor unions. The right to strike and to exert all the pressure upon employers which a strike carries with it, is gust as incontestable. It would be a fine commentary on a land like the United States, if we should extend the rigor of military discipline over our various great enter-prises; with the result that a man might be shot for leaving his post. The freedom which lies beneath the right to strike is one of the most vital concern to the public. Its preservation, and seeing that strikes are conducted according to the rules of public order, constitutes the State's entire duty. The Hon. James G. Blaine, at the time when the commotion of the Missouri Pacific strike of 1886 had scarcely subsided, laid down a remarkably con-cise form of the fundamental law by which all labor unions and their demonstrations must be regu-lated. It was: "One man's right ends where an-other man's right begins." While that principle is observed strikes represent a right at the very root of liberty. And this is sound. The Government cannot undertake to regulate all the' bug-nese of the country, but it can and should protect from violence the person and prop-ertY of all its citizens.
