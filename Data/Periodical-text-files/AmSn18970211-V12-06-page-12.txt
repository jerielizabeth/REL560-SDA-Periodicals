The "alliance" of this, people with the saloon is a myth. The Object of Civil Government. BY H. E. GIDDINGS. THE employment of physical power in self-defense, and in governing others, is wholly an artificial use of this gift. Physical power is God-given at creation; and so is natu-ral, and was appointed to natural and satisfactory ends. The Creator endowed man with intelligence to enable him to control the.lower orders of creation; the genius of self-control; and the faculty and physical .power to pursue happiness. But sin entered, turning the natural endow-ments of man into unlawful channels. The race multi-plied with men in possession of all their natural rights and powers; but with the inclination to use them wrong, and in selfishness refuse to allow them to others. Self-defense and civil government, therefore, became artificial necessities. The genius of government, which was of God to the individual that he might govern him-self, was now employed to, form a system to control those who had lost the power of self-government. The physical power given to enable man to improve the earth and pursue happiness, must now be employed to hold in check the vicious, to secure to as many as possible the enjoy-ment of their natural rights. What, then, is delegated to government by the con-sent of the governed? Power. What kind of power Physical power. And this physical power given to man -tube employed in other ways, in the pursuit of happiness, is largely con-sumed by being hurled against the vicious, in the form of police force and armies. To sum up, all must agree that each political citizen is a factor in the government exercising sovereignty; that all the responsibility of government rests alike on each member; and that each person occupying this position does so by consent. Each consents to the form of ad-ministration, the payment of its expenses the choosing and payment of officers to do the business, and they agree to furnish the power needed to make it all effective. All, the power of civil government is simply physical power, given by the Creator originally for other purposes. The principle of civil government is derived from the gen-ius of self-government, which the Creator implanted in the individual. Government, as we have it, is an artificial necessity, and not a natural provision of the Creator. The powers that be were originally ordained of God in the individual to keep him in harmony with the right; but sin having made inroads into this arrangement, the same power is now employed by outward means to control those who  refuse to recognize order within themselves : or who have entirely lost the genius of controlling themselves from within and now must be controled by others from with-out. It is the power that is in the persons by nature, fhat was ordained of God; and not the persons in power, nor the measures which they may adopt -in the use of that power. It has more often occurred that men have made a wrong use of the power, than otherwise. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, was using this power when he compelled all to worship a false God, and attempted to destroy those who were tine to the Creator; but this was a wrong use of the power. And God showed him that He did not approve of such a use of the power. When Pilate gave sentence against Christ he was using the power; but not properly. All bad statutes and all injustice in all ages have been due to a wrong use of the right power. The power was ordained to perpetuate a condition of peace and happi-ness by the observance of the divinely implanted princi-ple of self-control which was in the heart of each person_ In this way, originally, each was his own government, and perfect peace prevailed with no expense or cost of life, money, or labor. , No organized effort was needed there was no place for any such thing. When men lost from their hearts this divine principle. and power of self-government, then in order to approach as near as possible to the conditions necessary to secure in an imperfect state, life and its blessings, they had to be governed from without by organized force, whose symbol is the sword..  'With a "government of the people by the people and for the people" who compose it by consent, and give their power to it by Consent, as well as assume all its,  responsibilities by consent, the question may well arise, Who is properly a citizen in this political sense ? The re-sponsibility is a grave one. 10  No Representatives in Religion. THE members of the State and .National legislatures are, as legislators, the representatives of the people. Representatives in what? In religion? No; certainly not. Then what, can Congress or a State legislature properly have to do with religious affairs? As individuals, legislators are like other men account-able to their Creator in all things; but they are not and cannot be accountable to God for other persons, for eachsindividual must render his own account to God. He who expects to render his account or to settle it with God through a State legislature, or even through the Congress of the nationŠif there be anyone so foolishŠwill find himself terribly mistaken in the day of reckon-ing. Who is willing to be represented by another in reli-gious faith and practice? Who is willing to make a mem-ber of his State legislature or Of Congress his representa-tive in religion? Who is willing to be bound in religion
