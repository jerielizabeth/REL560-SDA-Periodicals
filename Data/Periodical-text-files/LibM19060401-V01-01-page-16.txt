Weligious Liberty Has Made this Nation Great If this nation is great for one reason more than for any other, it is that its found-ers stood for religious liberty. Note the following: GEORGE WASHINGTON : " Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is ac-countable alone to God for his religious GEORGE WASHINGTON faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience." THOMAS JEFFERSON: " Almighty God hath created the mind free. All attempts to in-fluence it by temporal punishments or bur-dens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord, both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercion on either, as was in His almighty power to do." JAMES MADISON : " Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct from government and exempt from its cognizance. A connection between them is injurious to both." U. S. GRANT: " Leave the matter of re-l'iÂ¥gion to the family altar, the church, and the private school supported entirely by private contributions. "Keep the State and the Church Forever Separate " The historian. John Clark Ridpath, has well said: " Proscription has no part or lot JAMES MADISON in the modern government of the world. The stake, the gibbet, and the rack, thumb-screws, swords, and pillory have no place THOMAS JEFFERSON among the machinery of civilization. Na-ture is diversified. So are human faculties, beliefs, and practises. Essential freedom is the right to differ, and that right must be sacredly respected."
