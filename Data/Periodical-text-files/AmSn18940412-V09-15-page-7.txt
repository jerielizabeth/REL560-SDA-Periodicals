APRIL 12, 1894. ..&101C EAFEIE CAIN- 119 prayer.. So strong had been the impres-sion of the evil wrought by such insin-cerity in the name of religion, that many of the more thoughtful religious leaders of the State have for some time advocated making an end of the simulacrum. Its abolition will doubtless seem to many timid souls as little better than a plunge into atheism, but it is really in the interest of religion as well as of common sense and sound ideas of government"Š The Nation, March 22, 1894. To Celebrate the Survival of Medim- valism. THE Theocrat, published at Johnstown, Pa., has, in its issue of March 31, this editorial paragraph :Š CENTENNIAL OF THE SUNDAY LAW. Circulars-  have been sent out by the Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, suggesting that on April 22nd, when the Sunday law of 1794 reaches its hundredth anniversary, the various Sabbath associations, the churches, all Sabbath organizations, and the labor unions all over the State, hold local celebrations. This is a good move, and should be observed by all who are in sympathy with a proper observance of the holy Sabbath. Sermons 'should be preached on this subject. All our Sabbath-schools should give special attention to this centennial. The existence of this survival of mediae-val error and bigotry, on its statute books, is a disgrace to the State of Pennsylvania, Šyet it is the pride of the Pennsylvania " Sabbath Association." Do the members of this association realize that they will live to see the Pennsylvania Sunday law, of 1794, used to the shame of the State, for the persecution of Christian men for conscience' sake ? When they see that, will they realize their error ? They will see it; but it remains to be seen whether they will acknowledge their mis-take. It will be too late then to rectify it,Ševen though some of those who now celebrate, not knowing what they do, should be the very ones to suffer from its persecuting power. W. H. M. Assuming Every Prerogative of Lead- ership. DURING the last quarter of this century has occurred a change in the fortunes of the Catholic Church in America which is almost a transformation; a change which possesses certain of the aspects of the miraculous, of the supernatural. . . . English Catholicism, under the exalted guidance of the four great cardinals, has signalized her release from legal persecu-tion by stepping to the very front, not only in her first and most glorious duty of winning back a world weary of the follies of materialism to the faith. . . . Here, also, in the United States, the torch of the new life is passed from hand to hand, and already the Catholic Church is assuming every prerogative of leadership. Within the last fifty years she has ad-vanced from a position of comparative weakness to the primacy; she is claiming the right of arbitration between capital and labor.

Hence, he who would know HOW TO AVOID ERROR IN THE FUTURE must know how errors have developed in the past. The " Fathers of the Catholic Church " shows the condition of the heathen world at the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, and shows how the adoption of these principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the stand-ard of pure Christianity, developed the papacy, which was simply a new form of paganism. The chapter on SUN-WORSHIP AND SUNDAY is alone worth the price of the book.
