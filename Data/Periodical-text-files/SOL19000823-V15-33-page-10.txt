522 THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY.                           and Germany persist in slamming the door shut. What is the United States to do in the face of such bad conduct from her Asiatic neighbors? If the in-tegrity of China is not to be maintained, and the territory of the empire must needs be partitioned, must not this country have a hand in the distribution of the "slices"? And will not that be justifiable un-der the circumstances? Thus leads the pathway to empire. " IN a political sense Christendom is to-day the world," says H. K. Carroll, D. D., L. L. D., in the Homiletic Review. " If we take a map of the globe and mark upon it the possessions and spheres of in-fluence of the Christian Powers there will be little or nothing left to the independent control of non-Christian governments. The islands of the sea are all:appropriated. The Western Continent is wholly under Christian rule." CHRISTIANITY should never be confounded with civilization, as is done in these words of Dr. Carroll. If we mark upon this map of the globe the amount of territory that has been stolen by the " Christian " Powers, that has been appropriated by them in de-liberate violation of the fundamental precepts of Christianity, we shall see that the earth is still far from being under. Christian control. Civilization is' in itself but a thin veneer over savagery. Christi-anity is a change from the savage nature to the di-vine nature. There are Christian " savages " and savage " Christians," and the former are infinitely preferable to the latter. Christianity blesses the inferior races of mankind, but mere civilization scorches and blasts them. This is the testimony of all experience. The weaker races of the earth can not copy the white man's virtues and can not resist the white man's vices. Without Christi-anity civilization only brings to the savage other un-, clean spirits to keep company with his own, and his last state is worse than the first. The wickedest places of the earth are not in heathen territory, but in so-called Christian lands. Politically, Christianity is not represented on the earth at all. REV. CHARLES M. SHELDON, the gentleman who wrote "In His Steps," or "What Would Jesus Do?" and who ran the Topeka Capital for one week as he thought Jesus would have done, visited England and  Scotland recently and was much alarmed at some things he saw. "If England goes to destruction in the next cen-tury," says Mr. Sheldon, "it will not be because of outside war or dangers from other nations, but be-cause she has drunk herself into destruction." But let us see; is not England a "Christian" na-tion with "Christian" laws, and especially a strict Sunday law rigidly enforced? The query that nat-urally arises in view of what Mr. Sheldon saw is this: If governmental recognition of the Creator, and the legal enforcement of Sunday does no better than this for England, will like measures do any more for the United States? ≈Å A RECENT London dispatch says that " only ath-letic clergymen need apply for pastorates in rural English districts. One country curate has received his order of removal, not because of any objection to his theology, but because he is a poor cricket player. The vicar declared: What the parish needs is a good, fast bowler, with a break from the off.' "The vicar evidently considers that the doctrine expounded by a clergyman capable of winning the county championship is irresistible to the average village lad." BISHOP CRANSTON is reported assaying: "A very rich Chinaman, whose business relations with for-eigners are valuable and extensive, said to one of them in the frankness of friendly conversation: I am worth to-day ten millions, but I would give my for-tune gladly to see China rid of every foreigner and the country back where it was before your people came. You have brought insatiable ambitions, and the discontent and unrest which led you to leave your own country for ours. Our people were happy in their patriarchal government and simple life. You foreigners are breaking down the old order and making them as unhappy as yourselves. Even your women are never satisfied with their condition.'" A CORRESPONDENT Of the Catholic Standard and Times, writing from Havana under date of July 21, describes a " monster parade " in that city upon the occasion of the installation of the newly-elected muni-cipal officers. " It is estimated," says the correspond-ent, " that over 30,000 persons took part in the in-augural parade, and it was quite different from any parade that I have ever witnessed in the city. As
