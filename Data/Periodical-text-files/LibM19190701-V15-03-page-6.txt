52 LIBERTY In Russia the Bolsheviki have nationalized all real estate and all public utilities and factories, together with much personal property, and they so control all supplies that it is impossible for members of the upper and middle classes to pro-cure the necessaries of life. It is not a question of price, or of having money, but of finding any one who will sell to the proscribed classes at any price. Those who renounce their property or business and become laboring people, or prole-tarians, may live, but others must starve to death, perish from cold, or be killed by those  bureaucracy had prepared in Russia a most fruitful soil for the growth of this particular type of radicalism, but the Romanoff system was able to repress the rising spirit of revolt until the horrors and abuses of the Great War, coupled with German money and German prop-aganda, set the furies free, deposed the czar, and instituted nominally the rule of the soviets, but in reality the despotism of two men, Le-nine and Trotzky.
