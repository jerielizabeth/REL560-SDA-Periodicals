They have framed a very drastic Sunday-observance bill for the District of Columbia, which they claim shall later become a Federal Sunday law for the whole nation. After many fruit-less attempts they finally induced Hon. Henry W. Temple, of Pennsylvania, to introduce their bill into the House of Representatives. The measure (H. R. 12504) was intro-duced Friday, February 13, and is en-titled, " A Bill to Protect the Lord's Day, Commonly Called Sunday, and to Secure Its Observance as a Day of Rest in the District of Columbia." The Pastors' Federation in conjunc-tion with the Lord's Day Alliance drew up this Sunday bill during the conven-tion of the Lord's Day ŁAlliance held in the Foundry Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D. C., from Dee. 11-14, 1919. They promised to intro-duce it into Congress inside of thirty days, but on account of their difficulty in finding a Congressman who was will-ing to become sponsor to such an un-American bill, the introduction of this  religious measure was delayed for more than a month. We trust that Congress will live up to its splendid record of the past 144 years by turning a deaf ear to the demands of a few religious agitators who are gifted with more zeal than knowledge. The Sunday bill this peculiar type of religionists have introduced, prohibits everything on Sunday except " works of necessity and charity." If this bill were enacted into law, it would transport us back to the days of Puritan New Eng-land when such laws were enacted and enforced by the civil authorities at the instigation of the established church of New England. To prohibit everything but " works of necessity and charity " on Sundays in the days of the Puritans, meant that one was not allowed to take a walk, a ride, or a drive on Sunday unless he went to the nearest church and attended divine services. On Sun-day afternoon, provided one had at-tended church service in the morning, he was permitted to walk or drive to the cemetery, provided he had recently bur-ied a loved one. All walks and drives for recreation and pleasure through fields and forests and along the high- ways were prohibited under penalty, as unnecessary. 35
