WE have no apology to offer in bringing to the attention of our readers a cook book discarding an article of diet which is everywhere known to contain disease-producing germs, often of a most virulent type.

Its 400 recipes are inter-spersed with short talks on foods and food combina-tions and other items of practical value and importance to every housewife, as well as to those who wish to study the subject of diet for their own benefit.
