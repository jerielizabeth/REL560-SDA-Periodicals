4i LIBERTY deny the workingman in their Sunday bill. They want him either to go to church on Sunday or remain idle all day at home. One of the ministers com-plained loudly that seven times more people were found in the Washington theaters on Sundays than in attendance at the church services, and that this competition between the theaters and churches ought to be stopped or soon the churches would be compelled to shut their doors. This shows plainly that the Pastors' Federation and the Lord's Day Alliance want Congress to enact their Sunday bill into law in order virtually to compel the 49,000 theatergoers to at-tend the churches. Why should the 7,000 churchgoers regulate the conduct of the 49,000 nonchurchgoers on Sun-days ? If the church has the right to shut up the theaters on Sundays to stop competition, then the theaters for the same reason have the right to shut up every church on every week day and night. No church ought to be opened on show nights. " What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander." Equal- ity before the law is the first of rights. The chief trouble with the Lord's Day Alliance is that they are confused and fail to draw a distinction between civil and religious laws and between human and divine institutions, and believe that people can be made religious by the enforcement of religio-political methods. They fail to draw a line of demarcation between the duties we owe to our Cre-ator and those which relate to man's conduct toward his fellow men. The Sabbath, or Lord's day, belongs to God and the church, and not to Cesar and the state, and ought to be observed, as all other divine institutions are, at the in-stigation of our own convictions of duty, devotional piety, and voluntary service. There is no more justification in the civil enforcement of the Lord's day than there would be in the civil enforcement of the Lord's Supper, the Lord's baptism, or the Lord's Prayer. All belong to the Lord and bear his superscription and not Caesar's; and the obligation is to the Lord through faith, and not to the Lord through force by Caesar.  111111=1111111113111111111111011MMIERRIOTITIMMIIEMBITIMIIMERIMIIM11111111M110111111=1111=11ifia 11111 I III IIIII  â€š4A Referendum on the Ten Commandments" 1111 I111111111I II I1111111111111111111111111111111innllnnl  By C.

Some months ago the New York Legislature passed a bill, which was promptly approved by the gov-ernor, giving the people of that State local option in the matter of Sunday sports. Attacking the new law in the columns of the American Searchlight, Rev. Rennitts C. Miller, D. D., styles this action a referendum on the ten etma-man dments, and represents as very an-surd the idea that the StatP has any  right to submit such a question to the people or that the voters might properly pass upon such a question even if sub-mitted. Dr. Miller says : " I fear many people, even some good people, take the position of a lawyer with whom the writer was recently conversing, who said: I be-lieve if the majority of the people of our city want Sunday baseball and Sunday moving pic-ture theaters, they ought to have them.' I re-plied: ' Of course, in general, we believe in the rule of the people. That is the spirit of de-mocracy. But there must, necessarily, be some limit of matters of referendum, especially when they affect the moral life of the people. Sup-pose a majority of the people of our eity (which
