It matters not how intelligent a people may be, if they lack the faculty of self-controlŠif they refuse to do that which is demanded by the principles of jus-ticeŠthey show themselves unfit for self-government and invite despotism. Nor is it possible for such a people to make laws that will compel themselves to deal justly. This is illustrated by the situation in St. Louis to-day. The mayor of the city belongs to one political party ; the governor of the state to another. Each fears to take any decisive step to restore order and protect persons and property in the city, lest he may alienate votes from his party. Thus the laws which the people have made for their own protection fail when that protec-tion is most needed, because those whose duty it is to enforce them fear to offend the people, who, by their representatives, made the laws. Such a condition of affairs is certain in time to destroy representative government. Such a state of affairs is anarchy and anarchy always invites despotism. B.
