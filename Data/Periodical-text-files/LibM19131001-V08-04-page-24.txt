EDITORIAL TRUE Americanism means loyalty to true American principles. 0/ At .4 AMERICA stands for religious liberty to all, and not for mere religious toler-ation toward any. 01 IV !V THE American idea of civil govern-ment places the inalienable rights of the individual above every other interest the state was ordained to protect. tt AMERICAN principles of civil govern-ment are unalterably opposed to a legal acknowledgment or establishment of any religion. !V  tV GOVERNMENT was not instituted to defend the majority. The majority are capable of taking care of themselves.
