15 THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. was not amended, nor was any substitute intro-duced during the session of Congress. $All there is to it is this : The American Sabbath Union, at its meeting in Washington last December, saw that the statement that the bill was designed to promote the observance of Sunday as a day of re-ligious worship, showed too plainly upon its face that it was an act to establish a State religion. Accordingly they appointed a committee to for-mulate changes they desired in the bill. This com-mittee reported; and among other things was the substitution of the word "protect" for " promote" in the preamble and last clause of the bill. These changes we immediately noted, publishing the original bill side by side with the bill as the Union desired it to read; we have printed it more than once, and have repeatedly referred to the change from "promote" to "protect ; " al-though, as it has been said before, the bill which was introduced into Congress read, " to promote its (the first day) observance as a day of religious worship," until the bill died a natural death by the adjournment of Congress. What Mr. Crafts objects to, however, is the fact that we have showed that the word "protect" does not conceal the object of the bill any more than did the word "promote." We have shown again and again that so far as the people who ob-serve Sunday are concerned, they do not need any more protection than they already have. There is abundant provision in the laws of every State for the protection of religious worship. And the bill which Mr. Blair introduced does not say that it is desired that the people shall be protected, but that the religious observance of the day shall be protected ; and that can mean nothing else but that all the people shall be prohibited from using the day in any other way than as a day of religious worship. And this is just what Mr. Crafts himself has said that they desire to secure by the passage of the bill. In the Washington Convention he de-clared that "the bill which has been introduced makes Sunday the ideal Sabbath of the Puritans, which day shall be occupied only by worship." So here we have No. 2 of Mr. Crafts's unfortu-nate collisions with facts. Again, the report says that, " Dr. Crafts gave a history of how the movement for Sabbath observ-ance first started, and denied, as has been charged, that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was at the head of the movement." Unfortu-nately for Mr. Crafts, we have something upon this point also. In the Union Signal of May 3, 1888, there appeared a report of a hearing which the. Senate Committee on Education and Labor gave on the 6th of the preceding month to the friends of a Sunday law. Mrs. J. C. Bateham, the superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temper-ance Union, presented the opening paper, and was followed by several ministers. The Union Signal, to which we just referred, said : " Senator Blair will now draft and present a bill for us." This shows that the bill was introduced at the request of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Again, in the hearing before the committee on Education and Labor, on Thursday, December 13, 1888, Mrs. Bateham, in replying to a question by Mr. Blair, said: " This petition work has been done chiefly by our Woman's Christian Tem- perance Union. The ministry, I may say, have had almost nothing to do with it. It was started in behalf of the elevation of the masses to protect  the morality of the people." This is sufficient on that point. Mr. Crafts says that the movement was started, not as a religious measure at all, but because some people saw that it was necessary to have a day of rest for the health of the multitude. Again he says : " Understand that 'religious ob-servance' nor the word of God' are not men-tioned in the bill and are no part of it. The Rest bill is for the benefit of the masses, and the health of the people." Mr. Crafts may presume upon the ignorance of the people to whom he lectures, but he ought to take some precaution to keep his lectures from getting into print, where they can be seen by those who are familiar with the Blair bill. With his statement that relig- ious observance is not mentioned in the bill, and is no part of it, com4are the preamble of the bill. We quote it with the changes desired by the American Sabbath Union, so that Mr. Crafts can find no fault with it. It reads as follows :Š "A bill to secure to the people the enjoyment of the Lord's day, commonly known as Sunday, as a day of rest, and to protect its observance as a day of re-ligious worship." Now it is technically true that the term " re-ligious observance" does not occur in this pre-amble; that is, the words do not occur in just that relation ; but nevertheless it is plainly de-clared that the bill is to protect the religious ob-servance of the day. But this is not all; the bill itself closes with the statement that "the act shall be construed so far as possible to secure to the whole people rest from toil during Sunday, their mental and moral culture, and the protec-tion of the religious observance of the day." Yet in the face of this Mr. Crafts wishes us to under-stand that " religious observance" is not mentioned in the bill and is no part of it ! The reader can draw his own conclusions as to the design of Mr. Crafts in making that statement. Again he says that "when P. M. Arthur, the head of the Locomotive Engineers, and T. V. Powderly, the head of the Knights of Labor, each representing thousands of signatures, signed the petition for this Sunday-Rest bill, it was plain that they saw the need of a day of rest for the workingmen." Mr. Crafts is here trying to substantiate his assertions that this Sunday movement was originated solely by the working-men and not by the .churches. But it is about as nefarious a statement as the other; for, as a mat-ter of fact, Mr. Powderly and Mr. Arthur did not indorse the petition in behalf of the thousands who had never seen it, until Mr. Crafts had la-bored with them for several hours, overcoming their objections. And further than this, the Union Signal, referring to the vote passed by the General Assembly of the Knights of Labor after Mr. Crafts had argued and pleaded with them, said that it was a wonderful victory achieved by Mr. Crafts. It could not have been very much of a victory to secure the signatures of those working-men, if the workingmen had instituted the move-ment. There seems to be a little discrepancy here which we will leave to Mr. Crafts to ex-plain. Once more, Mr. Crafts says that the bill does not deny the right to work to any citizen in the United States, on any day of the week, provided that citizen does not engage in trade, where there is competition, so that his neighbor is compelled to keep open his shop. If we had the space we would reprint the bill in full; but those who have files of the AMERICAN SENTINEL can find it,' and  can verify our statement that the bill specifies nothing of the kind. We will quote enough to show that it does deny the right of any per-son subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States to work on Sunday, even if he is not engaged in trade, and if there is no compe-tition. Section 1 of the bill (and let it be under-stood that we are quoting from the bill as amended by the American Sabbath Union) reads as follows :Š Be it enacted by the Senate and house of Representa-tives of the United States of America in Congress assem-bled, That no person or corporation, or the agent, servant, or employe of any person or corporation, shall perform or authorize to be performed any secu-lar work, labor, or business to the disturbance of others, works' of necessity, mercy, and humanity ex-cepted; nor shall any person engage in any play, game,or amusement, or recreation, to the disturbance of others on the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord's day, or during any part thereof, in any Territory, district, vessel, or place subject to the ex-clusive jurisdiction of the United States; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to receive pay for labor or service performed or rendered in violation of this section." We advise Mr. Crafts to study the Sunday bill a little more thoroughly before he lectures again. We might dwell at length upon the last state-ment quoted by Mr. Crafts in regard to compe-tition, but if we merely call attention to it it will be sufficient in this place to let the reader see that if his statement were true it would show that the Sunday movement was simply a part of a gi-gantic monopoly, that if carried out would eclipse anything that has ever been known. All that we designed to do in this article was to call attention to the almost constant collisions between the statements of the leaders in the Sunday-law movement and the truth. It can truly be said of them that they are not afraid of the truth, for they meet it in conflict nearly every day. E. J. W. Is the United States a Christian Nation? Tms question is answered in the affirmative by most Christians living in our glorious country. Let us see if the affirmation is based upon truth. How do those who hold that we are a Christian Nation prove, or attempt to prove, such to be a fact? Some would-be proofs for our national Christianity have recently come to our notice in the Rocky Mountain News, a leading political pa-per in this section of the country. Before giving his reasons why we are a Christian Nation, the editor of the News in the issue of April 11, by way of general remark, says : "It is singular that an intelligent person should question a prop-osition that is so palpably true." That proposition, however, is not so palpably true as the editor would imagine. "The truth is," the editor says a few sentences further onward, "-that it (the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States) merely establishes an equality of rights among Christian denominations, and incidentally admits and tolerates unbelief." This sentence misrepresents the first amendment entirely; but even if the sentence contained the truth, does the fact, we ask, that the Nation in its Constitution es-tablishes, and that merely establishes, an equality of rights among he various Christian denomina-tions, constitute it a Christian Nation? No, nc more than does the " incidental toleration of un-belief " constitute it an infidel Nation. One of the " reasons " why we are a Christian Nation, according to the News, is the following: " The Nation was established by Christians and it
