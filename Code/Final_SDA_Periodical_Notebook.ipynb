    "# REL 560 Final Project Notebook\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis on Seventh-day Adventist Periodicals\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my final project for REL 560 - Text Analysis with Dr. Jeri Wieringa! This final Jupyter Notebook consolidates the semester's worth of work in a readable, accessible, and singular notebook for reference and easy sharing of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I started with a collection of 783 issues from Seventh-day Adventist periodicals that centered topics of religious liberty. The three titles were *The American Sentinel* with 636 issues and abbreviated as AmSn, *The Sentinel of Christian Liberty* with 86 issues and abbreviated as SOL, and *Liberty: A Magazine of Religious Freedom* with 61 issues and abbreviated as LibM. It is important to note that SOL became LibM in 1906, but for the purposes of this project they were treated as separate titles. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, PDF scans of the periodicals were obtained from Dr. Jeri Wieringa. Part of Dr. Wieringa's larger dissertation project on Seventh-day Adventist documents, she obtained the documents digitally from the Office of Archives, Statistics, and Research for the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference. With the documents, metadata was created from each title that included information like the file name, publication date, issue and volume number, editorial team, and place of publication. The metadata files can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EGga_c7cY4RkqfFIo4azJtJ7IvTs7QpH?usp=sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the metadata was created, the PDFs of each issue were turned into text files. To make the text files easier to work with later in the process, each page of the issue was saved as its own text file resulting in 11,472 files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the text files, topic modeling was done in order to determine what sorts of topics were being discussed across the collection. By nature of how topic modeling works, each time the model is run it produces a different set of topics. The model used in this project was created on April 18, 2022 and run with 10 topics.

    "Overall, the page looks overwhelmingly positive in sentiment. To get a better understanding of what is happening on the most positive page of the 10 pages with the highest representation of Topic 4 of the 11,472 pages, I went and read the page. I was curious to see if it is positive in an unexpected way (perhaps the page praises the Pope or the Catholic Church for something) and if so what was going on.\n",

    "Upon reading the document, it appeared to be part of a larger piece that told a history of the Catholic Church. This specific page detailed a conflict between Pope Gregory XII and Pope John XXIII in the early 1400s. So, what does this tell us about the nature of the document and sentiment analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis can be useful, but can also be misleading. On first glance when the original sentiment scores were run, I could have concluded that the periodicals discuss the Catholic Church positively on some occasions. Even further, I could have presented the Sentinel of Christian Liberty Volume 18 Issue 07 page 13 as the example of the most positive document. We have ideas of what we mean by positive, but it was not until I looked at the content of the page specifically that the real reason it was being classified as positive by the sentiment analysis became clear. Descriptive words that were being used to present an overall neutral history of the conflict between the two popes like \"empowered\", \"lawful\", \"dignity\", and \"peace\" are recognized by the computer as positive words.

    "\n",
    "The processes of topic modeling and sentiment analysis are useful as they pointed to patterns that would have been impossible to see without using the computer due to the huge quantity of pages in the collection. Sentiment analysis does, however, fall short in this project because it is unable to decifer context of the words it has been told to flag as positive or negative. This project saw sentiment analysis interpret words being used in their original, descriptive context as positive, which is what it was asked to do. The process, though, falls short of the research question because the question relied on the assumption that the only emotions measured would be the intended emotions of the authors. Analysis like this can overlook things like context, sarcasm, and other rhetorical devices used by humans that are unreadable to the computer. All of this is to say that sentiment analysis has its value and place, but cannot be relied on alone to make conclusions about the tone and emotion of a text. While I may not have answered my question about if the Seventh-day Adventist periodicals are talking positively about the Catholic Church, I did get to learn about a conflict between two popes in the 1400s while developing computational skills that will be useful in my future reasearch.
